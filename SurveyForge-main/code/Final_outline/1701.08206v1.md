1 INTRODUCTION

2 METHODS  
2.1 Illustris simulation  
2.2 Stellar mocks  
2.3 Observational realism  
2.4 Bulge+disc decomposition  
2.5 Selection of an SDSS comparison sample  

3 GALAXY SIZE-LUMINOSITY RELATIONS  

4 IMPACT OF BULGE AND DISC MORPHOLOGIES  
4.1 Morphological dependence of the size-luminosity relation  
4.2 Bulge and disc fractions in Illustris and the SDSS  

5 THE DEFICIT OF BULGES IN LOW MASS ILLUSTRIS GALAXIES  
5.1 Morphological dependence on stellar mass  
5.2 Impact of stellar particle resolution/smoothing  
5.3 Comparison with kinematic B/T  

6 DISCUSSION  
6.1 Remaining challenges to realism: Dust  
6.2 Disconnect between kinematics and photometry
