1 INTRODUCTION

SPIDERS: AGN Target Selection

2 PREPARATION OF INPUT DATA SETS  
2.1 ROSAT All Sky Survey Catalogue (RASS)  
2.2 XMM-Newton Slew Survey Catalogue (XMMSL)  
2.3 AllWISE Candidate Counterpart Catalogue  
2.4 SDSS Photometric Counterpart Catalogue  
2.5 SDSS Spectroscopic Counterpart Catalogue  
2.6 3XMM-Bright Reference Catalogue  

3 SELECTING COUNTERPARTS TO X-RAY SOURCES  
3.1 Bayesian Posterior Probability of Associations  
3.2 Bayesian Priors Derived from a Bright X-ray Reference Sample  
3.3 Selection of SPIDERS RASS AGN Targets  
3.4 Selection of SPIDERS XMMSL AGN Targets  
3.5 X-ray Sources with SDSS-DR12 Spectra and Visual Inspections  

4 ASSESSING THE FIDELITY OF OUR TARGET SELECTION METHOD  
4.1 Verification of our X-ray–AllWISE Association Method Using a Bright X-ray Reference Sample  
4.2 Assessment of the Rate of Incorrect X-ray–IR Associations Using Blank Field Samples  
4.3 An Evaluation of Spurious X-ray Detections within the RASS Sample  
4.4 An Evaluation of the Method Used to Associate AllWISE Sources with Optical Counterparts  

5 RESULTS  
5.1 Properties of X-ray Sources with Existing Spectra in SDSS-DR12  

6 DISCUSSION  
6.1 Comparison with Anderson et al. (2007)  
6.2 Predictions for the SPIDERS-AGN Tier-0 Program
