1 INTRODUCTION  
2 THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK  
2.1 Torus modelling  
2.2 Stäckel approximation  
2.3 Distribution functions  
2.4 Numerical details of models used in this study  
3 ASSESSING A MODEL LIKELIHOOD: TWO APPROACHES  
3.1 General notation  
3.2 Evaluating with  \(\mathbf{x}(\pmb{\theta},\mathbf{J})\)  
3.3 Evaluating with  \(\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v})\)  
3.4 Choice of sampling density  
4 THE PROBLEM WITH ORBIT-BASED METHODS  
4.1 Extent of the problem  
4.2 Why could we determine the DF?  
5 THE SOLUTION: USE  \(\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v})\)
