1 Introduction

2 Ingredients of the analysis
2.1 Summary statistics

3 Simulated Likelihood Analysis - baseline scenario

4 Scenarios beyond the baseline analysis
4.1 Varying galaxy samples: systematics vs. statistics
4.2 Varying Rmin: linear galaxy bias vs. HOD model
4.3 Varying cosmology in covariances
4.4 Intrinsic alignment with multiple probes and systematics

5 Discussion

6 Conclusions
