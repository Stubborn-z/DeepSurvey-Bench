1. Why biharmonic Riemannian submersions?

3. Some recent work on biharmonic Riemannian submersions

3.1 Biharmonic Riemannian submersions from space forms

3.3 Biharmonic Riemannian submersions from Thurston’s 3-dimensional geometries

3.4 Biharmonic Riemannian submersions from \( M^{2}\times\mathbb{R} \)
