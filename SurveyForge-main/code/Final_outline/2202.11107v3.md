1 Introduction

2 Development of the SDSSRM-XCS cluster samples  
2.1 The SDSS redMaPPer cluster catalogue  
2.2 The XCS image database and source catalogue  
2.3 Identifying SDSSRM clusters in the XCS footprint  
2.4 Cross-matching the SDSSRM-XCS sample with XCS extended sources  
2.5 False-Positive Rate

3 X-ray Analysis of the SDSSRM-XCS sample  
3.1 Updates to XCS3P since LD11  
3.2 Luminosity estimates when $T_{X}$ is fixed  
3.3 Upper limit estimates in the absence of an XCS detection  
3.4 Introducing the various SDSSRM-XCS sub-samples  

4 Scaling relations derived from the SDSSRM-XCS samples  
4.1 The Luminosity-Temperature relation derived from the SDSSRM $\mathbf{XCS}_{T_{X},\nu o l}$ sample  
4.2 The X-ray observable-Richness relations derived from the SDSSRM $\mathbf{XCS}_{T_{X},\nu o l}$ sample  
4.3 Scaling relations with all available X-ray data  
4.4 Comparison to the literature

5 Discussion  
5.1 The dependence of scaling relations on detection type (targeted or serendipitous)  
5.2 Investigating $L_{X}-T_{X}$ isotropy with the SDSS $\mathbf{\Delta}\mathbf{X}\mathbf{C}\mathbf{S}_{\mathrm{ext}}$ sample
