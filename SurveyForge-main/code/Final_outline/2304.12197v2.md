1 INTRODUCTION
2 AN EMPIRICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LITHIUM EQUIVALENT WIDTH, TEMPERATURE AND AGE
2.1 The training data
2.2 Lithium equivalent widths
2.3 Lithium EW as a function of age and temperature
2.4 Dispersion of Lithium EW as a function of temperature and age
2.5 A maximum likelihood fit of the model to the training dataset
3 MODEL PERFORMANCE FOR SINGLE STARS AND CLUSTERS
3.1 Estimating the age of single stars
3.2 Estimating the ages of clusters and coeval groups
3.3 Comparing best fit ages to the training ages
3.4 Sensitivity to the training age scale
3.5 Sensitivity to target temperature scales
4 APPLICATION EXAMPLES
4.1 Estimating the ages of young exoplanets
4.2 Estimating the age of moving groups and associations
4.3 Application to clusters/data outside the Gaia-ESO Survey
