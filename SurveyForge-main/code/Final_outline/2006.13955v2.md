2 THE CLUSTER SAMPLE

3 METHODOLOGY
3.1 Blue shifting to the rest frame
3.2 Spectral fitting
3.3 Estimation of sterile neutrino mixing angles

4 RESULTS
4.1 Fits to individual clusters
4.2 Joint fits to sub-samples binned by temperature
4.3 Joint fits to the full sample

5 DISCUSSION
5.1 Individual clusters with excess emission at 3.5 keV
5.2 Methodology validation
