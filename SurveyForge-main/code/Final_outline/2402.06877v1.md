1 INTRODUCTION  
2 SAMI DATA AND MEASUREMENTS  
2.1 SAMI data  
2.2 Kinematic measurements  
2.3 Stellar population measurements  
2.4 Environmental measurements  
2.5 Sample size  
2.6 EAGLE simulation data  
3 METHODS  
4 THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SPIN AGE AND ENVIRONMENT IN SAMI GALAXIES  
4.1 Correlation analysis  
4.2 Trends across the age-gradient plane  
4.3 Trends as a function of mass  
5 COMPARISONS TO SIMULATIONS  
5.1 Simulation comparisons at z=0  
5.2 Simulations at z>0  
6 DISCUSSION  
6.1 Environment drives age, then age drives spin  
6.2 Why do old galaxies have low spin?  
6.3 What is special about the spin of high mass galaxies?  
7 CONCLUSIONS
