Dedicated to Prof. R. T. Rockafellar on the occasion of his 90th birthday.

1 Aims and scopes

2 Cyclic monotonicity, potentials, and generalizations  
2.1 Monotonicity and cyclic monotonicity  
2.2 Extensions of cyclic monotonicity  

3 Classical optimal transport  
3.1 Optimality implies $c$-cyclic monotonicity  
3.2 When $c$-cyclic monotonicity implies optimality?  
3.3 Existence of plans supported on a $c$-subgradient  

4 More general transport problems  
4.1 The multi-marginal, integral case  
4.2 The $L^{\infty}$-problem
