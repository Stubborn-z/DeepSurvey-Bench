1 Introduction  
2 Basic results: stability in nodal conforming virtual elements  
3 Stability in other “elliptic-type” virtual elements  
4 Stability in “non elliptic” virtual elements  
5 Dependence on the degree of accuracy and error estimators  
6 The stability bounds may imply interpolation estimates  
7 Conclusions and outlook
