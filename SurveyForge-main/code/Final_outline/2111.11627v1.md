1 INTRODUCTION  
2 DATA AND METHODS  
2.1 The SAMI Galaxy Survey  
2.2 Star formation rates and stellar masses  
2.3 Stellar metallicity estimates  
2.4 Gas-phase oxygen abundances  
3 RESULTS  
3.1 Comparing stellar and gas-phase metallicities  
3.2 Correlations with $\Delta Z_{g,\star}$  
3.3 A step further: the correlation between $\Delta Z_{g,\star}$ and sSFR  
4 DISCUSSION  
4.1 Comparing the metal content of stars and gas  
4.2 The difference between oxygen abundances and the overall ISM metal content
