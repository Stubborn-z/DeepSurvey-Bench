1 INTRODUCTION  
2 THE GALAXY SAMPLE  
3 RESULTS  
3.1 2D Kinematic maps and 1D kinematic profiles  
3.2 The kinematic behavior of the galaxies  
4 DISCUSSION  
4.1 Do the PNe and GC sub-populations follow the rotation of the stars?  
4.2 How did the aligned galaxies form?  
4.3 How did the mis-aligned galaxies form?  
5 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
