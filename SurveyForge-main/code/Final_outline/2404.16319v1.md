1 INTRODUCTION  
2 THE MAGPI SURVEY  
3 METHODS  
3.1 Emission line fits  
3.2 Stellar masses  
3.3 Star formation rates  
3.4 Global and local star formation metrics  
3.5 Derivation of radial profiles  
4 RESULTS  
4.1 ΔΣ SFR profiles  
4.2 Luminosity-weighted stellar ages  
5 DISCUSSION  
5.1 Do we observe an evolution in star formation activity with redshift at \( z \sim 0.3 \)?  
5.2 What regulates and/or quenches star formation at \( z \sim 0.3 \)?  
6 SUMMARY
