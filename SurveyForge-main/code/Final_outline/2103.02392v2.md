1 PHYSICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL CONTEXTS

2 MODEL  
2.1 Point source-corrected fits  
2.2 Model limitations  

3 METHODOLOGIES – ASSESSING EFFECTIVE CLEAN RESOLUTION AND FIT ACCURACY  
3.1 CLEAN model and image resolution  
3.2 Using the visibilities to quantify the accuracy of CLEAN model, CLEAN image, and frank brightness profiles  
3.3 A general note on comparing frank to CLEAN  

4 RESULTS

5 ANALYSIS  
5.1 The compact DSHARP discs all show substructure  
5.2 Extended discs show brighter rings, deeper gaps, and hints of inner disc substructure  
5.3 Two of the oldest DSHARP discs appear to have inner cavities  
5.4 Spiral arms appear to extend into the spiral discs’ cores  
5.5 The most structured DSHARP sources have morphologically similar inner discs  
5.6 Deep gap morphologies in frank profiles potentially indicate embedded planets  
5.7 A geometric viewing effect traces disc vertical structure
