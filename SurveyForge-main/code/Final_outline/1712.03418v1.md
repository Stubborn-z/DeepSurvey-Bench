1. Introduction

2. Data for our sample of MaNGA galaxies
2.1. Emission line fluxes
2.2. Galaxy size
2.3. Abundances

3. Abundances derived from H II region slit spectra, from SDSS fibre spectra, and from MaNGA spaxel spectra
3.1. Samples considered
3.2. Uncertainty in the SDSS-fibre-based abundances due to the uncertainty in the data reduction and emission-line measurements
3.3. Abundances determined from H II region slit spectra, from SDSS fibre spectra, and from MaNGA spaxel spectra
