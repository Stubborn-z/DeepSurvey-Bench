3 NIR DATA AND SOURCE CATALOGUES  
3.1 Observations and Photometry  
3.2 Star Cluster Catalogues  
3.3 Completeness Analysis  
4 STAR CLUSTER LUMINOSITY FUNCTIONS  
4.1 CLFs of the Individual SUNBIRD Targets  
4.2 Possible Uncertainties and Biases  
4.3 CLFs of Composite "Super Galaxies"  
4.4 CLFs on Sub-Galactic Scales  
5 OTHER CORRELATION SEARCHES WITH THE CLF SLOPES OF INDIVIDUAL GALAXIES  
5.1 Trends with the Brightest Star Clusters  
5.2 Trends with the Host Galaxy Properties  
6 DISCUSSION  
6.1 Caveats and Limitations  
6.2 Systematic Biases Alone Cannot Explain the Flatter Slopes  
6.3 Host Environments Appear to Influence the CLF Slopes  
6.4 Further Evidence of the Suggested Influence Based on the Trends with Various Host Global Properties  
6.5 Imprints of the Cluster Formation Mechanisms on the CLF Slopes?
