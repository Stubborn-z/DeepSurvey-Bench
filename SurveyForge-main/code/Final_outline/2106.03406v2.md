1 INTRODUCTION  
2 METHODOLOGY AND DATA SELECTION  
2.1 Azimuthal velocities derived from the proper motions towards the anticentre.  
2.2 The $[\mathbf{Fe/H}]$ determination.  
3 RESULTS  
3.1 Examining the Galactic anticentre on the $V_{\ell}$ vs. $[\mathbf{Fe/H}]$ plane  
3.2 Contamination of metal-rich stars at low metallicities.  
3.3 Statistical significance of the observed stellar substructures.  
4 DISCUSSION  
4.1 Implications on the formation of the very and extremely metal-poor thin disc.  
4.2 The thick disc, the Splash and the halo.  
5 CONCLUSIONS
