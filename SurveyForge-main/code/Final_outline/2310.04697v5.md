1 Research and development of a spectroscopic survey telescope and its astronomical achievements in China

2 From the Chinese 2.16-m telescope’s relay mirror to two kinds of Nasmyth systems  
2.1 Chinese 2.16-m telescope’s relay mirror and its significance  
2.2 Four-mirror Nasmyth system I  
2.3 Four-mirror Nasmyth system II  

3 Discussions of the S-ADC  

4 Discussion of some important issues and an example design for a 12-m aperture telescope with an FOV of 1.5°  

5 12-m four-mirror Nasmyth system I (or II) with an FOV of 2°  

6 12-m four-mirror Nasmyth system II with an FOV of 2.5°  

7 Discussion and conclusions  
7.1 Comparison of the optical system capabilities for the four telescope configurations  
7.2 Taking the same aperture of 14-m and comparison of optical system capabilities with Barden et al.
