1. Introduction

2. Observations and Analysis
2.1 Source Selection, Observations and Data Reduction

3. Results
3.1 Giant clumps are the locations of gravitational instability
3.2 Evidence for powerful outflows on clump scales
3.3 Is the high velocity dispersion of z>1 SFGs driven by star formation feedback?
3.4 Are the clumps rotationally supported?
3.5 Is the velocity dispersion isotropic?
3.6 Are there spatial variations in chemical abundances?

4. Discussion
4.1 Estimates of mass outflow rates
4.2 Clump lifetimes and evolution
