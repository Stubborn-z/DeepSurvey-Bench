3.2 D2: Significance of quantities from relation (2)
3.3 D3: Limitations of relation (2)
3.4 D4: On solitary observables
3.5 D5: About commutable observables
3.6 D6: Cases of angular observables Lz and φ
3.7 D7: On number and phase observables
3.8 D8: Concerning the energy - time pair
3.9 D9: Atypical analogues of UR (1) and (2)
3.10 D10: On the uniqueness of quantum measurements
3.11 D11: On the uniqueness of Planck's constant
3.12 D12: On the excessive ranking of UR
