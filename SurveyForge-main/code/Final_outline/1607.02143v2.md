1. INTRODUCTION: STAR-FORMATION HISTORIES—CONFORMAL, OR DIVERSE?  
2. GRAPHIC EVIDENCE FOR SFH DIVERSITY  
2.1. The SFHs of galaxies vary systematically by stellar mass, but with considerable overlap  
2.2. Four SFHs Made from Three SFRs  
3. THE DATA: SFHs FROM THE CARNEGIE-SPITZER-IMACS SURVEY  
4. THE BUILD-UP OF STELLAR MASS SINCE z=5  
5. CENTRALS AND SATELLITES? DIVERSITY IN SFHS WITH ENVIRONMENT  
6. CONSISTENCY OF CSI SFHs WITH THE G13 LOGNORMAL SFH MODEL  
7. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
