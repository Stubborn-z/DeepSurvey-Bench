1 INTRODUCTION
2 SETTING UP THE FISHER MATRIX ANALYSIS FOR 21CM BAO SURVEYS
2.1 Fiducial cosmology of the Fisher analysis
2.2 Fiducial 21cm survey configuration
2.3 The wedge effect due to the foreground contamination
2.4 Incorporating the wedge effect into the Fisher matrix: case of no reconstruction
3 THE WEDGE EFFECT ON THE BAO RECONSTRUCTION
3.1 BAO reconstruction in Fisher matrix calculations
3.2 BAO reconstruction of the wedged field
3.3 $N$-body simulations to calculate propagators
4 RESULTS
4.1 Reconstruction at $z=1$
4.2 Reconstruction at $z=2$
4.3 Propagators as a function of signal-to-noise and the wedge angle
4.4 The effect of the foreground on small line-of-sight wave modes during the BAO reconstruction
4.5 Effect of the wedge on the distance measurements
5 CONCLUSIONS
