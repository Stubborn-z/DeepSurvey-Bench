1 INTRODUCTION

2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA PROCESSING  
2.1 SPLASH–ATCA continuum data  
2.2 Additional VLA and ATCA data  

3 RESULTS  
3.1 OHPNe candidates in SPLASH–ATCA  
3.2 Radio continuum emission and spectral indices  
3.3 Optical-Infrared spectral energy distribution (SED)  

4 NOTES ON THE NEW OHPN CANDIDATES  

5 DISCUSSION  
5.1 The nature of the OHPN candidates as evolved stars  
5.2 Radio continuum emission: photo-ionized nebulae or winds ionized by other processes?  
5.3 Comparison with known OHPNe and a possible evolutionary sequence  
5.4 New color diagnostics for OHPNe
