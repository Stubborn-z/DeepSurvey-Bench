1. Introduction

2. Galaxy sample

3. Luminosity profile fitting
3.1. Synthetic luminosity profiles perpendicular to galaxy midplanes
3.2. Observed luminosity profiles perpendicular to galaxy midplanes
3.3. Comparison between observed and synthetic luminosity profiles
3.4. Determination of the height above which the thick disc dominates the luminosity profile
3.5. Selection of reliable vertical luminosity profile fits
3.6. Observed luminosity profiles parallel to galaxy midplanes
3.7. Fitting of the horizontal luminosity profiles

4. What if fits were done in galaxies not fulfilling our assumptions?
4.1. A galaxy model in order to test deviations from our assumptions
4.2. Effect of loosening our assumptions into the fitted Zs
4.3. Effect of loosening our assumptions into the fitted ΣT/Σt

5. Results
5.1. Thick disc relative masses
5.2. The breaks we fit are likely to be the same as those observed in face-on galaxies
5.3. Classification of the horizontal luminosity profile fits
5.4. Truncations in thin and thick discs
5.5. Anti-truncations in thin and thick discs

6. Discussion
6.1. Truncations in thick discs could be linked to a thin disc truncation
6.2. Genuine anti-truncations are rare

7. Summary and conclusions
