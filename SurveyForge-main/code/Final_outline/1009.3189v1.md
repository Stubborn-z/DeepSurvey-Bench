2 THE SAMPLE
2.1 The POWIR and DEEP2 surveys
2.2 Additional photometric redshifts
2.3 Stellar mass measurements
2.4 Rest-frame (U-B) colours and colour fractions fblue, fgreen and fred

3 CHARACTERISATION OF GALAXY ENVIRONMENTS
3.1 Nearest neighbour densities
3.2 Environment within a fixed aperture

4 RESULTS
4.1 Richness N1Mpc versus relative overdensity (1+δ3)
4.2 Galaxy environment correlated with stellar mass and cosmic time
4.3 Rest-frame colours and the blue fraction of galaxies as a function of cosmic time
4.4 Rest-frame colours and colour fractions correlated with environment
4.5 Rest-frame colours and colour fractions correlated with stellar mass
4.6 Disentangling dependencies on environment from dependencies on stellar mass

5 DISCUSSION
5.1 Environments of galaxies with different stellar masses
5.2 Relations between galaxy colour and stellar mass, local density and halo mass
5.3 Photo-z versus spec-z sample
