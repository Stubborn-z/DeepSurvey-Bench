1 INTRODUCTION

2 SYMBOLIC AND DISTRIBUTED REPRESENTATIONS: INTERPRETABILITY AND CONCATENATIVE COMPOSITIONALITY

3 STRATEGIES TO OBTAIN DISTRIBUTED REPRESENTATIONS FROM SYMBOLS
3.1 Dimensionality reduction with Random Projections
3.2 Learned representation

4 DISTRIBUTIONAL REPRESENTATIONS AS ANOTHER SIDE OF THE COIN
4.1 Building distributional representations for words from a corpus
4.2 Compacting distributional representations
4.3 Learning representations: word2vec

5 COMPOSING DISTRIBUTED REPRESENTATIONS
5.1 Compositional Distributional Semantics
5.2 Holographic Representations
5.3 Compositional Models in Neural Networks
