1 INTRODUCTION

2 THE SEARCH FOR GRAVITATIONAL LENSING IN THE BRIGHTEST OF REIONIZING GALAXIES SURVEY
2.1 The BoRG survey
2.2 Search for a candidate strongly lensed z~8 LBG
2.3 Photometry of the dropout and foreground objects
2.4 Photometry of the candidate counter image
2.5 Spectroscopy of the central foreground galaxies and dropout

3 MEASUREMENT OF LENS AND SOURCE PROPERTIES USING A MARKOV-CHAIN MONTE CARLO BAYESIAN INFERENCE

4 SOURCE MORPHOLOGY

5 DEFLECTOR MASS-TO-LIGHT RATIO

6 DISCUSSION
6.1 Previous studies of the lensed fraction of high z LBGs
6.2 Proximity to bright foreground objects
6.3 The foreground objects are typical deflectors of z~8 LBGs
6.4 Possible multiple imaging
6.5 Elongation of the dropout
6.6 Lack of companion dropouts in the field
6.7 Comparison with previous lensing studies of the BoRG sample

7 CONCLUSION
