1 INTRODUCTION

2 SWIFT DATA AND DEFINITION OF THE EXSESS SAMPLE  
2.1 Swift/XRT Data  
2.2 Construction of the ExSeSS Sample  
2.3 Calculation of survey area and sensitivity  
2.4 Comparison of survey area and sensitivity with previous surveys  

3 MEASUREMENTS OF X-RAY SOURCE NUMBER COUNTS  
3.1 Integrated number counts, $N(>S)$, in three energy bands  
3.2 Average absorption column density as a function of flux for the hard-band ExSeSS sample  
3.3 Differential number counts, dN/dS, using the hard-band ExSeSS sample  
3.4 Reconciling differential number counts with measurements at higher energies  
3.5 Comparison with AGN population synthesis models
