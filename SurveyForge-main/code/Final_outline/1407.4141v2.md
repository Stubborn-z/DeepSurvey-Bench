1. Introduction

2. Observations and Data Reduction  
2.1. Sample: Compact ( \( R_{\text{neb}} \lesssim 0.4~\text{pc} \) ) planetary nebulae within \( \sim1.5 \) kpc  
2.2. Observations  
2.3. Data Reduction

3. Results  
3.1. Cycle 14 detections of X-rays from PNe  
3.2. PNe displaying diffuse X-ray emission  
3.3. PNe displaying point-like X-ray emission at central stars  
3.4. X-ray non detections

4. Discussion  
4.1. Diffuse X-ray emission from [WR]-type CSPNe  
4.2. Diffuse X-ray emission and PN size, age, and electron density  
4.3. Binary detections/non-detections  
4.4. Diffuse X-ray emission from jet-wind interactions during common envelope ejection?
