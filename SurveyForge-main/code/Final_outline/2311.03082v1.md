1 INTRODUCTION

2 DIFFERENT WAYS TO CLASSIFY FACE ALIGNMENT METHODS  
2.1 Based on input data  
2.2 Based on output representation  
2.3 Based on model formalism  
2.4 Based on parameter estimation/optimisation  

3 COMPARISON OF FACE ALIGNMENT METHODS BASED ON OUTPUT FACE REPRESENTATION  
3.1 Active Shape Model (ASM)  
3.2 3D Point Distribution Models (3D PDM)  
3.3 Active Appearance Models (AAM)  
3.4 3D Morphable Models (3DMM)  
3.5 Bayesian Mixture Model  
3.6 Heatmaps  

4 DISCUSSION  

5 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
