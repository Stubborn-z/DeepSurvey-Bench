1 INTRODUCTION

2 DIPOLE FROM NUMBER COUNTS IN A RADIO SURVEY WITH A PARTIAL SKY COVERAGE

3 SELECTION OF IDENTICAL SKY COVERAGE FOR EACH OF FOUR RADIO SURVEYS FOR DIPOLES DETERMINATION

4 DIPOLES DETERMINED FROM SKY COVERAGE INCREASINGLY AWAY FROM THE DECLINATION LIMIT FOR EACH SURVEY

5 COMBINING THE DIPOLE VECTOR RESULTS FROM VARIOUS RADIO SURVEYS

6 ANOMALY OF THE MUCH LARGER AMPLITUDE FOR THE TGSS DIPOLE

7 A PECULIAR MOTION OF SOLAR SYSTEM NOT CONVERSANT WITH VARIOUS COSMIC DIPOLES – IMPLICATIONS FOR THE COSMOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE

8 CONCLUSIONS
