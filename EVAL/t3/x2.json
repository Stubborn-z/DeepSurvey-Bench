Background Overview of Large Language Models Large language models (LLMs) represent a significant advancement in natural language processing, excelling in generating human-like text but facing challenges with long-tail knowledge and domain-specific tasks due to limited dataset diversity. To enhance LLM performance, techniques such as retrieval augmentation and frameworks like Parametric Knowledge Guiding (PKG) integrate external knowledge [25,26,27,19]. Built on transformer architectures, LLMs utilize self-attention mechanisms to capture contextual dependencies, enabling coherent text generation. Pre-training on extensive text corpora equips LLMs with broad linguistic understanding, constrained by training data characteristics. Performance on fact-based questions correlates with exposure to relevant documents during pre-training; larger models perform better but require scaling for low-support queries. Retrieval augmentation improves LLM factual knowledge and performance by incorporating external documents, though it incurs computational costs. Techniques like document compression and selective augmentation mitigate these costs while maintaining efficacy. Retrieval-augmented generation consistently outperforms unsupervised fine-tuning in assimilating new knowledge, highlighting challenges in refining LLM capabilities with external datasets [16,15,28,19]. During pre-training, LLMs predict the next word in a sentence, enhancing contextually appropriate text generation, followed by fine-tuning for specific applications such as translation, summarization, and question answering. LLM performance is linked to model size, with larger models demonstrating superior text comprehension and generation capabilities. This scaling behavior illustrates the interplay between model size, dataset size, and computational resources, impacting model performance [13]. Larger LLMs require increased data and computational power, presenting challenges in resource allocation and efficiency. Despite their capabilities, LLMs face limitations, including hallucinations—generating text diverging from user input or established knowledge—undermining reliability. Memory constraints hinder long-tail knowledge retention, impacting performance on fact-based questions, as accuracy is linked to the volume of relevant documents seen during pre-training. Retrieval augmentation enhances access to external knowledge, improving LLMs' factual awareness and performance on low-support questions [15,12,19]. These challenges necessitate innovative approaches, such as retrieval-augmented generation, to bolster LLM reliability and accuracy. Limitations of LLMs Large language models (LLMs) face constraints impeding their efficacy in natural language processing, notably hallucinations and memory limitations. Hallucinations involve generating seemingly coherent but factually incorrect text, challenging LLM output reliability [11]. This is compounded by restricted fact verification against external sources [1]. Memory constraints limit LLMs' ability to manage tasks requiring extensive reasoning across multiple documents or larger contexts [7], leading to inefficiencies, especially with lengthy documents retrieved during inference, inflating computational demands [14].
