# Informational value

## 1.1 Objective Clarity

### Role Description
You are acting as an **experienced literature review evaluator**. Your task is to strictly assess whether the paper clearly and explicitly presents its research objective in the **Abstract** and **Introduction**.

### Scoring Criteria (Stricter & Conservative)

- **5 points**  
  The research objective is expressed with **high precision and explicit wording**, clearly linked to core problems in the field, and supported by a well-explained background and motivation. The objective must be stated in **specific sentences**, not inferred or implied.

- **4 points**  
  The research objective is generally clear, but parts of the background or motivation are brief or insufficient. Some connections to the research direction are **not fully justified**.

- **3 points**  
  The paper presents a research objective, but it is **partially vague, overly general, or weakly motivated**. Background statements are descriptive rather than explanatory.

- **2 points**  
  The objective is unclear, fragmented, or inconsistently stated. Background and motivation are **poorly explained or disconnected** from the objective.

- **1 point**  
  No explicit research objective is presented, or relevant content is too vague to support meaningful interpretation.


### Output Requirements (More Strict)

1. **First output the score (1–5).**
2. Provide a **rigorous justification**, citing:
   - exact sections
   - exact sentences or phrases
3. Do not infer or speculate — only evaluate content that is **explicitly stated** in the paper.
4. If key information is implied rather than stated clearly → **downgrade the score**.

## 1.2 Classification-Evolution Coherence

### Role Description
Evaluate only based on content appearing after the **Introduction** and before **Experiments / Evaluation**. Focus strictly on whether method classification and evolution are **explicitly described**.

### Scoring Criteria (Stricter)

- **5 points**  
  The method classification is **explicit, systematic, and logically structured**, and the evolution process is clearly presented with identifiable developmental stages supported by **specific textual evidence**.

- **4 points**  
  The classification is mostly clear and partially reflects development trends, but some transitions or relationships are **insufficiently explained**.

- **3 points**  
  The classification is partially vague, and the evolution process is mentioned but **lacks systematic explanation or continuity**.

- **2 points**  
  The classification is unclear, and no coherent description of method evolution is provided.

- **1 point**  
  Methods are listed independently with **no classification or evolution structure**.


### Output Requirements (More Conservative)

- Provide the score first.
- Then cite **specific fragments** that:
  - explicitly indicate classification
  - explicitly describe development or evolution
- If evidence is weak or indirect → **use a lower score**.

## 1.3 Dataset & Metric Coverage

### Role Description
Evaluate only based on **Data / Evaluation / Experiments** sections.

### Scoring Criteria (Stricter)

- **5 points**  
  Multiple datasets and metrics are covered with **detailed descriptions of scale, scenarios, and labeling**, and their use is explicitly justified.

- **4 points**  
  Several datasets and metrics are reported, but some descriptions are **brief or lack justification**.

- **3 points**  
  Limited dataset or metric coverage, with **shallow or incomplete descriptions**.

- **2 points**  
  Few datasets or metrics, and explanations are unclear or missing.

- **1 point**  
  Almost no meaningful dataset or metric coverage.

### Output Requirements

- Score first.
- Provide evidence by quoting **specific sentences**.
- If applicability or rationale is unclear → **downgrade the score**.


# Scholarly communication value

## 2.1 In-depth Comparison

### Role Description
Evaluate only explicit **comparative analysis** between methods.

### Scoring Criteria (Stricter)

- **5 points**  
  The paper provides a **structured, multi-dimensional comparison** with clearly stated:
  - similarities
  - differences
  - advantages & disadvantages  
  supported by explicit comparative wording.

- **4 points**  
  Comparisons exist but **some dimensions remain high-level or incomplete**.

- **3 points**  
  Only partial or superficial comparison; discussions lack technical depth.

- **2 points**  
  Methods are mostly listed with **minimal explicit comparison**.

- **1 point**  
  No meaningful comparison is presented.


### Output Requirements

- Provide score → then justification.
- Quote **contrastive sentences** (e.g., “Compared with …”, “Unlike …”).
- If comparison statements are generic → **use a lower score**.



## 2.2 Critical Analysis

### Role Description
Evaluate only explicit **interpretive or analytical commentary**, not descriptions.

### Scoring Criteria (Stricter)

- **5 points**  
  The review presents **deep, technically grounded critical reasoning**, explaining:
  - why differences arise
  - design trade-offs
  - limitations and implications

- **4 points**  
  Some analytical insights are present but **not fully developed**.

- **3 points**  
  Contains basic evaluative remarks, but analysis is **shallow or descriptive**.

- **2 points**  
  Only generic comments, lacking meaningful reasoning.

- **1 point**  
  No critical analysis.


### Output Requirements

- Score first.
- Cite sentences showing **explicit reasoning**, not summaries.
- If interpretation is weak → **downgrade**.


# Research guidance value

## 3.1 Research Gaps

### Scoring Criteria (Stricter)

- **5 points**  
  The paper identifies **multiple major gaps** and provides **detailed analysis** of their causes and potential impact.

- **4 points**  
  Several gaps are mentioned, but analysis is **brief or lacks depth**.

- **3 points**  
  Gaps are listed but **not deeply explained**.

- **2 points**  
  Only limited or superficial gap statements.

- **1 point**  
  No meaningful gap identification.

### Output Requirements

- Provide score → then justification.
- Quote **specific sentences** stating gaps.
- If reasoning is incomplete → **downgrade**.



## 3.2 Prospectiveness

### Scoring Criteria (Stricter)

- **5 points**  
  The paper proposes **clear, innovative, and actionable** future research directions explicitly linked to identified gaps.

- **4 points**  
  Future directions are forward-looking but **brief or insufficiently justified**.

- **3 points**  
  Directions are broad or generic, lacking explicit linkage to gaps.

- **2 points**  
  Future work is vague or conventional.

- **1 point**  
  No future directions provided.


### Output Requirements

- Score first.
- Quote future-work sentences.
- If suggestions are general or speculative → **use a lower score**.
