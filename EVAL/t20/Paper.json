      "content": "The development of Large Language Models like GPT-4~ref:gpt4, Qwen2~ref:qwen2, and LLaMA~ref:llama3 has sparked a revolution in the field of artificial intelligence, fundamentally altering the landscape of natural language processing. These models, built on Transformer~ref:transformer architectures and trained on diverse and extensive datasets, have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in understanding, interpreting, and generating human language. The impact of these advancements is profound, stretching across various sectors including healthcare~ref:med1,ref:med2,ref:med3, finance~ref:financialgpt,ref:finalcialgpt2, and education~ref:edu1,ref:edu2, where they facilitate more nuanced and efficient interactions between humans and machines. Despite their remarkable language comprehension and text generation capabilities, LLMs may exhibit limitations due to a lack of domain-specific knowledge, real-time updated information, and proprietary knowledge, which are outside LLMs' pre-training corpus. These gaps can lead to a phenomenon known as ``hallucination''~ref:hallucination where the model generates inaccurate or even fabricated information. Consequently, it is imperative to supplement LLMs with external knowledge to mitigate this problem. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)~ref:ragsurvey1,ref:ragsurvey2,ref:ragsurvey3,ref:ragsurvey4,ref:ragsurvey5,ref:ragsurvey6,ref:ragsurvey7 emerged as a significant evolution, which aims to enhance the quality and relevance of generated content by integrating a retrieval component within the generation process. The essence of RAG lies in its ability to dynamically query a large text corpus to incorporate relevant factual knowledge into the responses generated by the underlying language models. This integration not only enriches the contextual depth of the responses but also ensures a higher degree of factual accuracy and specificity. RAG has gained widespread attention due to its exceptional performance and broad applications, becoming a key focus within the field. figure* \\centering \\abovecaptionskip{0.15cm} \\includegraphics[scale=0.37]{Figure/figure1-new1.pdf} Comparision between Direct LLM, RAG, and GraphRAG. Given a user query, direct answering by LLMs may suffer from shallow responses or lack of specificity. RAG addresses this by retrieving relevant textual information, somewhat alleviating the issue. However, due to the text's length and flexible natural language expressions of entity relationships, RAG struggles to emphasize ``influence'' relations, which is the core of the question. While, GraphRAG methods leverage explicit entity and relationship representations in graph data, enabling precise answers by retrieving relevant structured information. figure* Although RAG has achieved impressive results and has been widely applied across various domains, it faces limitations in real-world scenarios: (1) Neglecting Relationships: In practice, textual content is not isolated but interconnected. Traditional RAG fails to capture significant structured relational knowledge that cannot be represented through semantic similarity alone. For instance, in a citation network where papers are linked by citation relationships, traditional RAG methods focus on finding the relevant papers based on the query but overlook important citation relationships between papers. (2) Redundant Information: RAG often recounts content in the form of textual snippets when concatenated as prompts. This makes context become excessively lengthy, leading to the ``lost in the middle'' dilemma~ref:lostin. (3) Lacking Global Information: RAG can only retrieve a subset of documents and fails to grasp global information comprehensively, and hence struggles with tasks such as Query-Focused Summarization~(QFS). Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG)~ref:graphrag,ref:grag,ref:gnn-rag emerges as an innovative solution to address these challenges. Unlike traditional RAG, GraphRAG retrieves graph elements containing relational knowledge pertinent to a given query from a pre-constructed graph database, as depicted in Figure~fig:1. These elements may include nodes, triples, paths, or subgraphs, which are utilized to generate responses. GraphRAG considers the interconnections between texts, enabling a more accurate and comprehensive retrieval of relational information. Additionally, graph data, such as knowledge graphs, offer abstraction and summarization of textual data, thereby significantly shortening the length of the input text and mitigating concerns of verbosity. By retrieving subgraphs or graph communities, we can access comprehensive information to effectively address the QFS challenge by capturing the broader context and interconnections within the graph structure. In this paper, we are the first to provide a systematic survey of GraphRAG. Specifically, we begin by introducing the GraphRAG workflow, along with the foundational background knowledge that underpins the field. Then, we categorize the literature according to the primary stages of the GraphRAG process: Graph-Based Indexing (G-Indexing), Graph-Guided Retrieval (G-Retrieval), and Graph-Enhanced Generation (G-Generation) in Section~sec:indexing, Section~sec:retrieval and Section~sec:generation respectively, detailing the core technologies and training methods within each phase. Furthermore, we investigate downstream tasks, application domains, evaluation methodologies, and industrial use cases of GraphRAG. This exploration elucidates how GraphRAG is being utilized in practical settings and reflects its versatility and adaptability across various sectors. Finally, acknowledging that research in GraphRAG is still in its early stages, we delve into potential future research directions. This prognostic discussion aims to pave the way for forthcoming studies, inspire new lines of inquiry, and catalyze progress within the field, ultimately propelling GraphRAG toward more mature and innovative horizons. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: itemize \\item We provide a comprehensive and systematic review of existing state-of-the-art GraphRAG methodologies. We offer a formal definition of GraphRAG, outlining its universal workflow which includes G-Indexing, G-Retrieval, and G-Generation. \\item We discuss the core technologies underpinning existing GraphRAG systems, including G-Indexing, G-Retrieval, and G-Generation. For each component, we analyze the spectrum of model selection, methodological design, and enhancement strategies currently being explored. Additionally, we contrast the diverse training methodologies employed across these modules. \\item We delineate the downstream tasks, benchmarks, application domains, evaluation metrics, current challenges, and future research directions pertinent to GraphRAG, discussing both the progress and prospects of this field. Furthermore, we compile an inventory of existing industry GraphRAG systems, providing insights into the translation of academic research into real-world industry solutions. itemize \\noindentOrganization.\\quad The rest of the survey is organized as follows: Section~sec:surveys compares related techniques, while Section~sec:formalization outlines the general process of GraphRAG. Sections~sec:indexing to~sec:generation categorize the techniques associated with GraphRAG's three stages: G-Indexing, G-Retrieval, and G-Generation. Section~sec:training introduces the training strategies of retrievers and generators. Section~sec:app summarizes GraphRAG's downstream tasks, corresponding benchmarks, application domains, evaluation metrics, and industrial GraphRAG systems. Section~sec:future provides an outlook on future directions. Finally, Section~sec:conclusion concludes the content of this survey. figure* \\centering \\includegraphics[width=1\\linewidth]{Figure/overview.pdf} The overview of the GraphRAG framework for question answering task. In this survey, we divide GraphRAG into three stages: G-Indexing, G-Retrieval, and G-Generation. We categorize the retrieval sources into open-source knowledge graphs and self-constructed graph data. Various enhancing techniques like query enhancement and knowledge enhancement may be adopted to boost the relevance of the results. Unlike RAG, which uses retrieved text directly for generation, GraphRAG requires converting the retrieved graph information into patterns acceptable to generators to enhance the task performance. figure*",

In the past two years, researchers have written many comprehensive surveys about RAG~ref:ragsurvey1,ref:ragsurvey2,ref:ragsurvey3,ref:ragsurvey4,ref:ragsurvey5,ref:ragsurvey6,ref:ragsurvey7. For example,~ref:ragsurvey1,ref:ragsurvey5 categorize RAG methods from the perspectives of retrieval, generation, and augmentation.~ref:ragsurvey4 review RAG methods for databases with different modalities.~ref:ragsurvey6 systematically summarize the evaluation of RAG methods. These works provide a structured synthesis of current RAG methodologies, fostering a deeper understanding and suggesting future directions of the area. From a broad perspective, GraphRAG can be seen as a branch of RAG, which retrieves relevant relational knowledge from graph databases instead of text corpus. However, compared to text-based RAG, GraphRAG takes into account the relationships between texts and incorporates the structural information as additional knowledge beyond text. Furthermore, during the construction of graph data, raw text data may undergo filtering and summarization processes, enhancing the refinement of information within the graph data. Although previous surveys on RAG have touched upon GraphRAG, they predominantly center on textual data integration. This paper diverges by placing a primary emphasis on the indexing, retrieval, and utilization of structured graph data, which represents a substantial departure from handling purely textual information and spurs the emergence of many new techniques.",

      "content": "LLMs are revolutionizing natural language processing due to their excellent text understanding, reasoning, and generation capabilities, along with their generalization and zero-shot transfer abilities. Although LLMs are primarily designed to process pure text and struggle with non-Euclidean data containing complex structural information, such as graphs~ref:cansolve,ref:gpt4graph, numerous studies~ref:gfmsurvey1,ref:gfmsurvey2,ref:gfmsurvey3,ref:gfmsurvey4,ref:gfmsurvey5,ref:gfmsurvey6,ref:gfmsurvey7,ref:gfmsurvey8,ref:engine,ref:graphbridge have been conducted in these fields. These papers primarily integrate LLMs with GNNs to enhance modeling capabilities for graph data, thereby improving performance on downstream tasks such as node classification, edge prediction, graph classification, and others. For example,~ref:engine propose an efficient fine-tuning method named ENGINE, which combines LLMs and GNNs through a side structure for enhancing graph representation. Different from these methods, GraphRAG focuses on retrieving relevant graph elements using queries from an external graph-structured database. In this paper, we provide a detailed introduction to the relevant technologies and applications of GraphRAG, which are not included in previous surveys of LLMs on Graphs.",

Previous surveys typically categorize existing KBQA approaches into two main types: Information Retrieval (IR)-based methods and Semantic Parsing (SP)-based methods. Specifically, IR-based methods~ref:rog,ref:tog,ref:tog2,ref:unikgqa,ref:sr,ref:rra,ref:kd-cot,ref:kg-agent retrieve information related to the query from the knowledge graph (KG) and use it to enhance the generation process. While SP-based methods~ref:noname3,ref:dara,ref:retrack,ref:rng,ref:arcaneqa,ref:hsge generate a logical form (LF) for each query and execute it against knowledge bases to obtain the answer. GraphRAG and KBQA are closely related, with IR-based KBQA methods representing a subset of GraphRAG approaches focused on downstream applications. In this work, we extend the discussion beyond KBQA to include GraphRAG’s applications across various downstream tasks.

Classical GNNs, e.g., GCN~ref:gcn, GAT~ref:gat, GraphSAGE~ref:graphsage, adopt a message-passing manner to obtain node representations. Formally, each node representation $h^{(l-1)}_i$ in the $l$-th layer is updated by aggregating the information from neighboring nodes and edges: equation h^{(l)}_i = UPD(h^{(l-1)}_i, AGG_{j \\in N(i)}MSG(h^{(l-1)}_i,h^{(l-1)}_j, e^{(l-1)}_{i,j})), equation where $N_{(i)}$ represents the neighbors of node $i$. MSG denotes the message function, which computes the message based on the node, its neighbor, and the edge between them. AGG refers to the aggregation function that combines the received messages using a permutation-invariant method, such as mean, sum, or max. UPD represents the update function, which updates each node's attributes with the aggregated messages. Subsequently, a readout function, e.g., mean, sum, or max pooling, can be applied to obtain the global-level representation: equation h_G = READOUT_{i \\in V_G}(h_i^{(L)}). equation In GraphRAG, GNNs can be utilized to obtain representations of graph data for the retrieval phase, as well as to model the retrieved graph structures.",

      "section_title": "Overview of GraphRAG",
      "level": "1",
      "content": "GraphRAG is a framework that leverages external structured knowledge graphs to improve contextual understanding of LMs and generate more informed responses, as depicted in Figure~fig:overview. The goal of GraphRAG is to retrieve the most relevant knowledge from databases, thereby enhancing the answers of downstream tasks. The process can be defined as equation aligned a^* = \\arg\\max_{a \\in A} p(a|q,G), aligned equation where $a^*$ is the optimal answer of the query $q$ given the TAG $G$, and $A$ is the set of possible responses. After that, we jointly model the target distribution $p(a|q,G)$ with a graph retriever $p_\\theta(G|q,G)$ and an answer generator $p_\\phi (a|q,G)$ where $\\theta, \\phi$ are learnable parameters, and utilize the total probability formula to decompose $p(a|q,G)$, which can be formulated as equation aligned p(a|q,G) &= \\sum\\limits_{G \\subseteq G} p_\\phi (a|q,G) p_\\theta(G|q,G) \\\\ &\\approx p_\\phi (a|q,G^*) p_\\theta(G^*|q,G), aligned equation where $G^*$ is the optimal subgraph. Because the number of candidate subgraphs can grow exponentially with the size of the graph, efficient approximation methods are necessary. The first line of Equation~eq:total is thus approximated by the second line. Specifically, a graph retriever is employed to extract the optimal subgraph $G^*$, after which the generator produces the answer based on the retrieved subgraph. Therefore, in this survey, we decompose the entire process of GraphRAG into three main stages: Graph-Based Indexing, Graph-Guided Retrieval, and Graph-Enhanced Generation. The overall workflow of GraphRAG is illustrated in Figure 2 and detailed introductions of each stage are as follows. Graph-Based Indexing (G-Indexing) \\sloppy Graph-Based Indexing constitutes the initial phase of GraphRAG, aimed at identifying or constructing a graph database $G$ that aligns with downstream tasks and establishing indices on it. The graph database can originate from public knowledge graphs~ref:wikidata,ref:freebase,ref:dbpedia,ref:yago,ref:conceptnet,ref:atomic, graph data~ref:tudataset, or be constructed based on proprietary data sources such as textual~ref:graphrag,ref:dalk,ref:kgp,ref:hipporag or other forms of data~ref:noname1. The indexing process typically includes mapping node and edge properties, establishing pointers between connected nodes, and organizing data to support fast traversal and retrieval operations. Indexing determines the granularity of the subsequent retrieval stage, playing a crucial role in enhancing query efficiency. Graph-Guided Retrieval (G-Retrieval) Following graph-based indexing, the graph-guided retrieval phase focuses on extracting pertinent information from the graph database in response to user queries or input. Specifically, given a user query $q$ which is expressed in natural language, the retrieval stage aims to extract the most relevant elements (e.g., entities, triplets, paths, subgraphs) from knowledge graphs, which can be formulated as equation aligned G^* &= G-Retriever(q, G) \\\\ &= \\argmax_{G \\subseteq R(G)} \\, p_\\theta(G|q,G) \\\\ &= \\argmax_{G \\subseteq R(G)} \\, Sim(q, G), aligned equation where $G^*$ is the optimal retrieved graph elements and $Sim(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is a function that measures the semantic similarity between user queries and the graph data. $R(\\cdot)$ represents a function to narrow down the search range of subgraphs, considering the efficiency. Graph-Enhanced Generation (G-Generation) The graph-enhanced generation phase involves synthesizing meaningful outputs or responses based on the retrieved graph data. This could encompass answering user queries, generating reports, etc. In this stage, a generator takes the query, retrieved graph elements, and an optional prompt as input to generate a response, which can be denoted as equation aligned a^* &= G-Generator(q, G^*) \\\\ &= \\argmax_{a \\in A} p_\\phi (a|q,G^*) \\\\ &= \\argmax_{a \\in A} p_\\phi (a|F(q,G^*)), aligned equation where $F(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is a function that converts graph data into a form the generator can process.",

Using these knowledge graphs could dramatically reduce the time and resources required to develop and maintain. In this survey, we further classify them into two categories according to their scopes, i.e., General Knowledge Graphs and Domain Knowledge Graphs. (1) General Knowledge Graphs General knowledge graphs primarily store general, structured knowledge, and typically rely on collective input and updates from a global community, ensuring a comprehensive and continually refreshed repository of information. Encyclopedic knowledge graphs are a typical type of general knowledge graph, which contains large-scale real-world knowledge collected from human experts and encyclopedias. For example, Wikidatahttps://www.wikidata.org/~ref:wikidata is a free and open knowledge base that stores structured data of its Wikimedia sister projects like Wikipedia, Wikivoyage, Wiktionary, and others. Freebasehttp://www.freebase.be/~ref:freebase is an extensive, collaboratively edited knowledge base that compiles data from various sources, including individual contributions and structured data from databases like Wikipedia. DBpediahttps://www.dbpedia.org/~ref:dbpedia represents information about millions of entities, including people, places, and things, by leveraging the infoboxes and categories present in Wikipedia articles. YAGOhttps://yago-knowledge.org/~ref:yago collects knowledge from Wikipedia, WordNet, and GeoNames. Commonsense knowledge graphs are another type of general knowledge graph. They include abstract commonsense knowledge, such as semantic associations between concepts and causal relationships between events. Typical Commonsense Knowledge Graphs include: ConceptNethttps://conceptnet.io/~ref:conceptnet is a semantic network built from nodes representing words or phrases connected by edges denoting semantic relationships. ATOMIC~ref:atomic,ref:atomic2 models the causal relationships between events. (2) Domain Knowledge Graphs As discussed in Section~sec:intro, domain-specific knowledge graphs are crucial for enhancing LLMs in addressing domain-specific questions. These KGs offer specialized knowledge in particular fields, aiding models in gaining deeper insights and a more comprehensive understanding of complex professional relationships. In the biomedical field, CMeKGhttps://cmekg.pcl.ac.cn/ encompasses a wide range of data, including diseases, symptoms, treatments, medications, and relationships between medical concepts. CPubMed-KGhttps://cpubmed.openi.org.cn/graph/wiki is a medical knowledge database in Chinese, building on the extensive repository of biomedical literature in PubMed. In the movie domain, Wiki-Movies~ref:wikimovie extracts structured information from Wikipedia articles related to films, compiling data about movies, actors, directors, genres, and other relevant details into a structured format. Additionally,~ref:graphcot construct a dataset named GR-Bench, which includes five domain knowledge graphs spanning academic, E-commerce, literature, healthcare, and legal fields. Furthermore,~ref:g-retriever convert triplet-format and JSON files from ExplaGraphs and SceneGraphs into a standard graph format and selects questions requiring 2-hop reasoning from WebQSP to create the universal graph-format dataset GraphQA for evaluating GraphRAG systems.",

For downstream tasks that do not inherently involve graph data, researchers often propose constructing a graph from multiple sources (e.g., documents, tables, and other databases) and leveraging GraphRAG to enhance task performance. Generally, these self-constructed graphs are closely tied to the specific design of the method, distinguishing them from the open-domain graph data previously mentioned. To model the structural relationships between the documents,~ref:atlantic propose to construct a heterogeneous document graph capturing multiple document-level relations, including co-citation, co-topic, co-venue, etc.~ref:gnn-net,ref:kgp establish relationship between passages according to shared keywords. To capture the relations between entities in documents,~ref:noname5,ref:graphrag,ref:hipporag,ref:dalk utilize the named entity recognition tools to extract entities from documents and language models to further extract relations between entities, where the retrieved entities and relations then form a knowledge graph. There are also some mapping methods for downstream tasks that need to be designed based on the characteristics of the task itself. For example, to solve the patent phrase similarity inference task,~ref:ra-sim convert the patent database into a patent-phrase graph. Connections between patent nodes and phrase nodes are established if the phrases appear in the patents, while connections between patent nodes are based on citation relations. Targeting customer service technical support scenarios,~ref:noname1 propose to model historical issues into a KG, which transforms the issues into tree representations to maintain the intra-issue relations, and utilize semantic similarities and a threshold to preserve inter-issue relations.",

These methods aim to deepen the understanding or completeness of the retrieved information over successive iterations. In this survey, we further classify iterative retrieval into two categories: (1) non-adaptive and (2) adaptive retrieval. We provide a detailed summary of these two categories of methods below. (1) Non-Adaptive Retrieval Non-adaptive methods typically follow a fixed sequence of retrieval, and the termination of retrieval is determined by setting a maximum time or a threshold. For example, PullNet~ref:pullnet retrieves problem-relevant subgraphs through $T$ iterations. In each iteration, the paper designs a retrieval rule to select a subset of retrieved entities, and then expands these entities by searching relevant edges in the knowledge graph. In each iteration, KGP~ref:kgp first selects seed nodes based on the similarity between the context and the nodes in the graph. It then uses LLMs to summarize and update the context of the neighboring nodes of the seed nodes, which is utilized in the subsequent iteration. (2) Adaptive Retrieval One distinctive characteristic of adaptive retrieval is to let models autonomously determine the optimal moments to finish the retrieval activities. For instance,~ref:rra,ref:kn leverage an LM for hop prediction, which serves as an indicator to end the retrieval. There is also a group of researchers who utilize model-generated special tokens or texts as termination signals for the retrieval process. For example, ToG~ref:tog,ref:tog2 prompts the LLM agent to explore the multiple possible reasoning paths until the LLM determines the question can be answered based on the current reasoning path.~ref:sr trains a RoBERTa to expand a path from each topic entity. In the process, a virtual relation named as ``[END]'' is introduced to terminate the retrieval process. Another common approach involves treating the large model as an agent, enabling it to directly generate answers to questions to signal the end of iteration. For instance,~ref:graphcot,ref:structgpt,ref:kg-agent,ref:knowledgpt,ref:oda propose LLM-based agents to reason on graphs.

On the other hand, encoder-decoder and decoder-only models, such as T5~ref:t5, GPT-4~ref:gpt4, and LLaMA~ref:llama3, are adept at both discriminative and generative tasks. These models excel in text understanding, generation, and reasoning, allowing them to process textual inputs directly and generate textual responses~ref:graphrag,ref:rok,ref:rog,ref:graphcot,ref:tog,ref:gnn-rag,ref:keqing,ref:hykge.",

      "content": "Considering the strengths of GNNs at representing the structure of graph data, and the robust understanding of text demonstrated by LMs, many studies are exploring the integration of these two technologies to generate coherent responses. This paper categorizes the hybrid generative approaches into two distinct types: cascaded paradigm and parallel paradigm. (1) Cascaded Paradigm In the cascaded approaches, the process involves a sequential interaction where the output from one model serves as the input for the next. Specifically, the GNN processes the graph data first, encapsulating its structural and relational information into a form that the LM can understand. Subsequently, this transformed data is fed into the LM, which then generates the final text-based response. These methods leverage the strengths of each model in a step-wise fashion, ensuring detailed attention to both structural and textual data. In these methods, prompt tuning~ref:p-tuning,ref:p-tuning2,ref:prefix-tuning,ref:prompttuning is a typical approach, where GNNs are commonly employed to encode the retrieved graph data. The encoded graph data is subsequently pre-pended as a prefix to the input text embeddings of an LM. The GNN is then optimized through downstream tasks to produce enhanced encodings of the graph data~ref:g-retriever,ref:grag,ref:graphtranslator,ref:gentkgqa. (2) Parallel Paradigm On the other hand, the parallel approach operates by concurrently utilizing the capabilities of both the GNN and the LLM. In this setup, both models receive the initial inputs simultaneously and work in tandem to process different facets of the same data. The outputs are then merged, often through another model or a set of rules, to produce a unified response that integrates insights from both the graphical structure and the textual content. In the parallel paradigm, a typical approach involves separately encoding inputs using both GNNs and LMs, followed by integrating these two representations, or directly integrating their output responses. For instance,~ref:safe aggregate predictions from GNNs and LMs by weighted summation to obtain the final answer.~ref:kagnet,ref:kg-r3 integrate the graph representations derived from GNNs and the text representations generated by LMs using attention mechanisms. ref:qa-gnn,ref:atlantic,ref:grapeqa directly concatenate graph representations with text representations. Another approach involves designing dedicated modules that integrate GNNs with LMs, enabling the resulting representations to encapsulate both structural and textual information. For instance, ref:greaselm introduce a module called the GreaseLM Layer, which incorporates both GNN and LM layers. At each layer, this module integrates textual and graph representations using a two-layer MLP before passing them to the next layer. Similarly, ENGINE~ref:engine proposes G-Ladders, which combine LMs and GNNs through a side structure, enhancing node representations for downstream tasks. Discussion Hybrid models that harness both the representation capabilities of GNNs for graph data and LMs for text data hold promising applications. However, effectively integrating information from these two modalities remains a significant challenge.",

However, when utilizing LMs as generators, the non-Euclidean nature of graph data poses a challenge, as it cannot be directly combined with textual data for input into the LMs. To address this, graph translators are employed to convert the graph data into a format compatible with LMs. This conversion enhances the generative capabilities of LMs by enabling them to effectively process and utilize structured graph information. In this survey, we summarize two distinct graph formats: graph languages and graph embeddings. We illustrate this process with an example in Figure~fig:4, with detailed introductions provided below. figure* \\centering \\abovecaptionskip{0.15cm} \\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{Figure/figure41.pdf} Illustration of the graph languages.

      "section_title": "Graph Languages",
      "level": "3",
      "content": "A graph description language is a formalized system of notation that is specifically crafted to characterize and represent graph data. It prescribes a uniform syntax and semantic framework that describes the components and interconnections within a graph. Through these languages, users can consistently generate, manipulate, and interpret graph data in a comprehensible format to machines. They enable the definition of graph architectures, the specification of attributes for nodes and edges, and the implementation of operations and queries on graph structures. Next, we will introduce five types of graph languages separately: Adjacency / Edge Table, Natural Language, Codes, Syntax Tree, and Node Sequence. (1) Adjacency / Edge Table The adjacency table and the edge table are widely used methods for describing graph structures~ref:talk,ref:gpt4graph,ref:cansolve,ref:noname6. The adjacency table enumerates the immediate neighbors of each vertex, offering a compact way to represent connections in sparse graphs. For example, KG-GPT~ref:kg-gpt linearizes the triples in the retrieved subgraph, which are then concatenated and fed into the LLMs. Conversely, the edge table details all the edges within the graph, providing a straightforward representation that is particularly useful for processing and analyzing graphs in a linear format. Both two methods are brief, easy to understand, and intuitive. (2) Natural Language Given that user queries are typically presented in natural language, and considering the outstanding natural language comprehension capabilities of LMs, it becomes a compelling approach to describe the retrieved graph data using natural language. By translating graph data into descriptive, easily comprehensible language, LMs can bridge the gap between raw data representation and user-friendly information, facilitating more effective interactions with data-driven applications. For example, some researchers~ref:noname2,ref:mvp-tuning propose defining a natural language template for each type of edge in advance and subsequently filling in the endpoints of each edge into the corresponding template based on its type.~ref:instructglm employ natural language to describe the information of $1$-hop and $2$-hop neighboring nodes of the central node.~ref:graphrag utilize LLMs to generate report-like summaries for each detected graph community.~ref:rra,ref:kn adopt LMs to rewrite the edge table of retrieved subgraphs, generating a natural language description.~ref:talk explore different representations of nodes (e.g., Integer encoding, alphabet letters, names, etc.) and edges (e.g., parenthesis, arrows, incident, etc.).~ref:graphcot,ref:structgpt,ref:kg-agent,ref:knowledgpt,ref:oda integrate information from different granularities within the graph into prompts through natural language in the form of dialogue. (3) Code-Like Forms Considering that natural language descriptions and other $1$-D sequences are inherently inadequate for directly representing the $2$-D structure of graph data, and given the robust code comprehension capabilities of LMs, many researchers~ref:gpt4graph explore using code-like formats to represent graph structures. For example, ~ref:gpt4graph examine the use of Graph Modeling Language (GML)~ref:gml and Graph Markup Language (GraphML)~ref:graphml for representing graphs. These standardized languages are specifically designed for graph data, providing comprehensive descriptions that encompass nodes, edges, and their interrelationships. (4) Syntax Tree Compared to direct flattening of graphs, some research~ref:graphtext propose transforming graphs into structures akin to syntax trees. Syntax trees possess a hierarchical structure and, being topological graphs, also maintain a topological order. This method retains more structural information, enhancing the understanding and analysis of the graph's intrinsic properties. Such a transformation not only preserves the relational dynamics between different graph elements but also facilitates more sophisticated algorithms for graph analysis and processing. GRAPHTEXT~ref:graphtext proposes transforming the ego network of a central node into a graph-syntax tree format. This format not only encapsulates structural information but also integrates the features of the nodes. By traversing this syntax tree, it is possible to obtain a node sequence that maintains both topological order and hierarchical structure. (5) Node Sequence Some studies~ref:llaga,ref:gnn-rag propose representing graphs through sequences of nodes, which are often generated using predefined rules. Compared to natural language descriptions, these node sequences are more concise and incorporate prior knowledge, specifically the structural information emphasized by the rules.~ref:rog,ref:tog transform the retrieved paths into node sequences and input them into an LLM to enhance the task performance. LLaGA~ref:llaga proposes two templates that can transform graphs into node sequences. The first template, known as the Neighborhood Detail Template, offers a detailed examination of the central node along with its immediate surroundings. The second, termed the Hop-Field Overview Template, provides a summarized perspective of a node's neighborhood, which can be expanded to encompass broader areas. GNN-RAG~ref:gnn-rag inputs the retrieved reasoning paths into LMs in the form of node sequences as prompts. Discussion Good graph languages should be complete, concise, and comprehensible. Completeness entails capturing all essential information within the graph structure, ensuring no critical details are omitted. Conciseness refers to the necessity of keeping textual descriptions brief to avoid the ``lost in the middle'' phenomenon~ref:lostin or exceeding the length limitations of LMs. Lengthy inputs can hinder LMs' processing capabilities, potentially causing loss of context or truncated data interpretation. Comprehensibility ensures that the language used is easily understood by LLMs, facilitating accurate representation of the graph's structure. Due to the characteristics of different graph languages, their choice can significantly impact the performance of downstream tasks~ref:talk.",

Thus, using GNNs to represent graphs as embeddings presents a promising alternative. The core challenge lies in integrating graph embeddings with textual representations into a unified semantic space. Current research focuses on utilizing prompt tuning methodologies, as discussed earlier. There are also some methods that adopt FiD (Fusion-in-Decoder)~ref:fid,ref:kgfid, which first convert the graph data into text, then encode it using an LM-based encoder and input it into the decoders~ref:reano,ref:decaf,ref:skp. Notably, feeding graph representations into LMs is feasible primarily with open-source LMs, not closed-source models like GPT-4~ref:gpt4.

In fact, there is no clear boundary between Pre-Generation Enhancement and Retrieval. In this survey, we categorize the retrieval stage as the process of retrieving knowledge from the original graph, and merging and pruning retrieved knowledge. Subsequent operations are considered Pre-Generation Enhancements. Commonly used pre-generation enhancement approaches primarily involve semantically enriching the retrieved graph data to achieve tighter integration between the graph data and textual query.~ref:rra employ LLMs to rewrite retrieved graph data, enhancing the naturalness and semantic richness of the transformed natural language output. This method not only ensures that graph data is converted into more fluent and natural language but also enriches its semantic content. Conversely, DALK~ref:dalk utilizes the retrieved graph data to rewrite the query.~ref:temple-mqa first leverage LLMs to generate a reasoning plan and answer queries according to the plan.~ref:grapeqa,ref:qa-gnn aim to enhance GNNs by enabling them to learn graph representations relevant to queries. They achieve this by extracting all nouns from the QA pairs (or the QA pairs themselves) and inserting them as nodes into the retrieved subgraph.~ref:rearev propose a method where, prior to generation, the representation of the query is decomposed into multiple vectors termed ``instructions'', each representing different features of the query. These instructions are used as conditions during message passing when applying GNNs to learn from retrieved subgraphs.

Some methods focus on integrating outputs from the same generator under different conditions or inputs. For example,~ref:graphrag generate a summary for each graph community, followed by generating responses to queries based on the summary, and then scoring these responses using an LLM. Ultimately, the responses are sorted in descending order according to their scores and sequentially incorporated into the prompt until the token limit is reached. Subsequently, the LLM generates the final response.~ref:keqing,ref:kg-gpt first decompose the query into several sub-questions, then generate answers for each sub-question, and finally merge the answers of all sub-questions to obtain the final answer. Alternatively, other methods combine or select responses generated by different models.~ref:kagnet,ref:safe combine the outputs generated by both GNNs and LLMs to reach a synergistic effect. UniOQA~ref:unioqa explores two methods for generating answers: one involves generating queries in Cypher Query Language (CQL) to execute and obtain results, while the other method directly generates answers based on retrieved triplets. The final answer is determined through a dynamic selection mechanism. In EmbedKGQA~ref:embedkgqa, besides the learned scoring function, researchers additionally design a rule-based score based on the graph structures.

For instance, MemNNs~ref:memnns leverages metric learning to closely align the ground truth with the query in semantic space while differentiating unrelated facts from the query. On the contrary, when the retrieval granularity is paths, training retrievers often adopts an autoregressive approach, where the previous relationship path is concatenated to the end of the query. The model then predicts the next relation based on the concatenated input~ref:rra,ref:kn. However, the lack of ground truth for retrieval content in the majority of datasets poses a significant challenge. To address this issue, many methods attempt to construct reasoning paths based on distant supervision to guide retriever training. For example,~ref:sr,ref:ksl,ref:rog extract all paths (or shortest paths) between entities in the queries and entities in the answers, using them as training data for the retriever. In addition,~ref:sr also employ a relationship extraction dataset for distant supervision in unsupervised settings. There is another category of methods that utilize implicit intermediate supervision signals to train Retrievers. For instance, NSM~ref:nsm employs a bidirectional search strategy, where two retrievers start searching from the head entity and tail entity, respectively. The supervised objective is to ensure that the paths searched by the two retrievers converge as closely as possible. KnowGPT~ref:knowgpt and MINERVA~ref:minerva treat the selection of adjacent nodes to build paths or subgraphs as a Markov process. They design the reward function around the inclusion of the answer in the retrieved information and adopt reinforcement learning methods e.g. policy gradient to optimize the retriever. Some methods argue that distant supervision signals or implicit intermediate supervision signals may contain considerable noise, making it challenging to train effective retrievers. Therefore, they consider employing self-supervised methods for pre-training retrievers. SKP~ref:skp pre-trains the DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval) model~ref:dpr.

These benchmarks usually cover multiple task domains to provide a comprehensive test result. For example, STARK~ref:stark benchmarks LLM Retrieval on semi-structured knowledge bases covering three domains, including product search, academic paper search, and queries in precision medicine to access the capacity of current GraphRAG systems.~ref:g-retriever propose a flexible question-answering benchmark targeting real-world textual graphs, named GraphQA, which is applicable to multiple applications including scene graph understanding, commonsense reasoning, and knowledge graph reasoning.

      "section_title": "Metrics",
      "level": "3",
      "content": "The evaluation metrics for GraphRAG can be broadly categorized into two main types: downstream task evaluation (generation quality) and retrieval quality. (1) Downstream Task Evaluation (Generation Quality) In the majority of research studies, downstream task evaluation metrics serve as the primary method for assessing GraphRAG's performance. For example, in KBQA, Exact Match (EM) and F1 score are commonly used to measure the accuracy of answering entities. In addition, many researchers utilize BERT4Score and GPT4Score to mitigate instances where LLMs generate entities that are synonymous with the ground truth but not exact matches. In CSQA, Accuracy is the most commonly used evaluation metric. For generative tasks such as QA systems, metrics like BLEU, ROUGE-L, METEOR, and others are commonly employed to assess the quality of the text generated by the model. (2) Retrieval Quality Evaluation While evaluating GraphRAG based on downstream task performance is feasible, directly measuring the accuracy of retrieved content poses challenges. Therefore, many studies employ specific metrics to gauge the precision of retrieved content. For instance, when ground truth entities are available, retrieval systems face a balance between the quantity of retrieved information and the coverage of answers. Hence, some studies utilize the ratio between answer coverage and the size of the retrieval subgraph to evaluate the performance of the retrieval system. In addition, several studies have explored metrics such as query relevance, diversity, and faithfulness score to respectively assess the similarity between retrieved content and queries, the diversity of retrieved content, and the faithfulness of the information retrieved.",

These systems are characterized by their reliance on industrial graph database systems or their focus on large-scale graph data, details of which are as follows. $\\bullet$ GraphRAG (by Microsoft)https://github.com/microsoft/graphrag: The system uses LLMs to construct entity-based knowledge graphs and pre-generate community summaries of related entity groups, which enables the capture of both local and global relationships within a document collection, thereby enhancing Query-Focused Summarization (QFS) task~ref:graphrag. The project can also utilize open-source RAG toolkits for rapid implementation, such as LlamaIndexhttps://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/ examples/index structs/knowledge graph/KnowledgeGraphDemo.html, LangChainhttps://python.langchain.com/docs/use\\_cases/graph, etc. $\\bullet$ GraphRAG (by NebulaGraph)https://www.nebula-graph.io/posts/graph-RAG: The project is the first industrial GraphRAG system, which is developed by NebulaGraph Corporation. The project integrates LLMs into the NebulaGraph database, which aims to deliver more intelligent and precise search results. $\\bullet$ GraphRAG (by Antgroup)https://github.com/eosphoros-ai/DB-GPT: The framework is developed on the foundation of several AI engineering frameworks such as DB-GPT, knowledge graph engine OpenSPG, and graph database TuGraph. Specifically, the system begins by extracting triples from documents using LLMs, which are then stored in the graph database. During the retrieval phase, it identifies keywords from the query, locates corresponding nodes in the graph database, and traverses the subgraph using BFS or DFS. In the generation phase, the retrieved subgraph data is formatted into text and submitted along with the context and query for processing by LLMs. $\\bullet$ NallM (by Neo4j)https://github.com/neo4j/NaLLM: The NaLLM (Neo4j and Large Language Models) framework integrates Neo4j graph database technology with LLMs. It aims to explore and demonstrate the synergy between Neo4j and LLMs, focusing on three primary use cases: Natural Language Interface to a Knowledge Graph, Creating a Knowledge Graph from Unstructured Data, and Generate Reports Using Both Static Data and LLM Data. $\\bullet$ LLM Graph Builder (by Neo4j)https://github.com/neo4j-labs/llm-graph-builder: It is a project developed by Neo4j for automatically constructing knowledge graphs, suitable for the GraphRAG's Graph Database Construction and Indexing phase. The project primarily utilizes LLMs to extract nodes, relationships, and their properties from unstructured data, and utilizes the LangChain framework to create structured knowledge graphs.",

This information is then transformed into a sequence that can be understood by LLMs, resulting in a very long context. There are two issues with inputting such long contexts: LLMs cannot handle very long sequences, and extensive computation during inference can be a hindrance for individuals. To address these problems, lossless compression of long contexts is crucial. This approach removes redundant information and compresses lengthy sentences into shorter, yet meaningful ones. It helps LLMs capture the essential parts of the context and accelerates inference. However, designing a lossless compression technique is challenging. Current works~ref:kbqasurvey1,ref:kbqasurvey2 make a trade-off between compression and preserving information.
