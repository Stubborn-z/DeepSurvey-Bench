Golden-Retriever incorporates a reflection-based question augmentation step before document retrieval, which involves identifying jargon, clarifying its meaning based on context, and augmenting the question accordingly. Specifically, our method extracts and lists all jargon and abbreviations in the input question, determines the context against a pre-defined list, and queries a jargon dictionary for extended definitions and descriptions. This comprehensive augmentation ensures the RAG framework retrieves the most relevant documents by providing clear context and resolving ambiguities, significantly improving retrieval accuracy. Evaluations using three open-source LLMs on a domain-specific question-answer dataset demonstrate Golden-Retriever's superior performance, providing a robust solution for efficiently integrating and querying industrial knowledge bases.", "arxivid": "2408.00798v1"}
{"title": "Business-RAG: Information Extraction for Business Insights", "abstract": ": Enterprises depend on diverse data like invoices, news articles, legal documents, and financial records to operate. Efficient Information Extraction (IE) is essential for extracting valuable insights from this data for decision-making. Natural Language Processing (NLP) has transformed IE, enabling rapid and accurate analysis of vast datasets. Tasks such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), Relation Extraction (RE), Event Extraction (EE), Term Extraction (TE), and Topic Modeling (TM) are vital across sectors. Yet, implementing these methods individually can be resource-intensive, especially for smaller organizations lacking in Research and Development (R&D) capabilities. Large Language Models (LLMs), powered by Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), offer a cost-effective solution, seamlessly handling multiple IE tasks. Despite their capabilities, LLMs may struggle with domain-specific queries, leading to inaccuracies. To overcome this challenge, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) complements LLMs by enhancing IE with external data retrieval, ensuring accuracy and relevance. While the adoption of RAG with LLMs is increasing, comprehensive business applications utilizing this integration remain limited. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a novel application named Business-RAG, showcasing its potential and encouraging further research in this domain.", "arxivid": ""}

{"title": "Direct Fact Retrieval from Knowledge Graphs without Entity Linking", "abstract": "There has been a surge of interest in utilizing Knowledge Graphs (KGs) for various natural language processing/understanding tasks. The conventional mechanism to retrieve facts in KGs usually involves three steps: entity span detection, entity disambiguation, and relation classification. However, this approach requires additional labels for training each of the three subcomponents in addition to pairs of input texts and facts, and also may accumulate errors propagated from failures in previous steps. To tackle these limitations, we propose a simple knowledge retrieval framework, which directly retrieves facts from the KGs given the input text based on their representational similarities, which we refer to as Direct Fact Retrieval (DiFaR). Specifically, we first embed all facts in KGs onto a dense embedding space by using a language model trained by only pairs of input texts and facts, and then provide the nearest facts in response to the input text. Since the fact, consisting of only two entities and one relation, has little context to encode, we propose to further refine ranks of top-k retrieved facts with a reranker that contextualizes the input text and the fact jointly. We validate our DiFaR framework on multiple fact retrieval tasks, showing that it significantly outperforms relevant baselines that use the three-step approach.", "arxivid": "2305.12416v1"}
{"title": "Knowledge-Augmented Language Model Prompting for Zero-Shot Knowledge Graph Question Answering", "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of performing zero-shot closed-book question answering tasks, based on their internal knowledge stored in parameters during pre-training. However, such internalized knowledge might be insufficient and incorrect, which could lead LLMs to generate factually wrong answers. Furthermore, fine-tuning LLMs to update their knowledge is expensive. To this end, we propose to augment the knowledge directly in the input of LLMs. Specifically, we first retrieve the relevant facts to the input question from the knowledge graph based on semantic similarities between the question and its associated facts. After that, we prepend the retrieved facts to the input question in the form of the prompt, which is then forwarded to LLMs to generate the answer. Our framework, Knowledge-Augmented language model PromptING (KAPING), requires no model training, thus completely zero-shot. We validate the performance of our KAPING framework on the knowledge graph question answering task, that aims to answer the user’s question based on facts over a knowledge graph, on which ours outperforms relevant zero-shot baselines by up to 48% in average, across multiple LLMs of various sizes.", "arxivid": "2306.04136v1"}
{"title": "Knowledge-Augmented Language Model Verification", "abstract": "Recent Language Models (LMs) have shown impressive capabilities in generating texts with the knowledge internalized in parameters. Yet, LMs often generate the factually incorrect responses to the given queries, since their knowledge may be inaccurate, incomplete, and outdated. To address this problem, previous works propose to augment LMs with the knowledge retrieved from an external knowledge source. However, such approaches often show suboptimal text generation performance due to two reasons: 1) the model may fail to retrieve the knowledge relevant to the given query, or 2) the model may not faithfully reflect the retrieved knowledge in the generated text. To overcome these, we propose to verify the output and the knowledge of the knowledge-augmented LMs with a separate verifier, which is a small LM that is trained to detect those two types of errors through instruction-finetuning. Then, when the verifier recognizes an error, we can rectify it by either retrieving new knowledge or generating new text. Further, we use an ensemble of the outputs from different instructions with a single verifier to enhance the reliability of the verification processes. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed verification steps on multiple question answering benchmarks, whose results show that the proposed verifier effectively identifies retrieval and generation errors, allowing LMs to provide more factually correct outputs.

{"title": "Language models are few-shot learners", "abstract": "Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.", "arxivid": "2005.14165v4"}

Natural language queries formed to extract information from a KB entail starting from specific nodes and reasoning over multiple edges of the corresponding KG to arrive at the correct set of answer nodes. Traditional approaches of question answering on KG are based on (a) semantic parsing (SP), where a logical form (e.g., S-expression, SPARQL query, etc.) is generated using node and edge embeddings and then reasoning over these representations or tuning language models to generate the final answer directly, or (b) information-retrieval based that works by extracting entities and relations sequentially. In this work, we evaluate the capability of (LLMs) to answer questions over KG that involve multiple hops. We show that depending upon the size and nature of the KG we need different approaches to extract and feed the relevant information to an LLM since every LLM comes with a fixed context window.

The importance of extracted knowledge provided to these systems is vital from both accuracy (completeness of information) and efficiency (extracting the information in a timely manner).

First, they usually rely only on web as a source of extracted knowledge and adding other external knowledge sources can hamper the efficiency of the system.

{"title": "Graph-Based Retriever Captures the Long Tail of Biomedical Knowledge", "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are transforming the way information is retrieved with vast amounts of knowledge being summarized and presented via natural language conversations. Yet, LLMs are prone to highlight the most frequently seen pieces of information from the training set and to neglect the rare ones. In the field of biomedical research, latest discoveries are key to academic and industrial actors and are obscured by the abundance of an ever-increasing literature corpus (the information overload problem). Surfacing new associations between biomedical entities, e.g., drugs, genes, diseases, with LLMs becomes a challenge of capturing the long-tail knowledge of the biomedical scientific production. To overcome this challenge, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has been proposed to alleviate some of the shortcomings of LLMs by augmenting the prompts with context retrieved from external datasets. RAG methods typically select the context via maximum similarity search over text embeddings. In this study, we show that RAG methods leave out a significant proportion of relevant information due to clusters of over-represented concepts in the biomedical literature. We introduce a novel information-retrieval method that leverages a knowledge graph to downsample these clusters and mitigate the information overload problem. Its retrieval performance is about twice better than embedding similarity alternatives on both precision and recall.

Given the rapid progress of this research direction, a systematic review summarizing the latest advancements for Graph ML in the era of LLMs is necessary to provide an in-depth understanding to researchers and practitioners. Therefore, in this survey, we first review the recent developments in Graph ML. We then explore how LLMs can be utilized to enhance the quality of graph features, alleviate the reliance on labeled data, and address challenges such as graph Heterophily and Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization. Afterward, we delve into how graphs can enhance LLMs, highlighting their abilities to enhance LLM pre-training and inference. Furthermore, we investigate various applications and discuss the potential future directions in this promising field.", "arxivid": "2404.14928v2"}

Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD) is an effective retrieval-augmented reader model to address this task. Given that FiD independently encodes passages, which overlooks the semantic relationships between passages, some studies use knowledge graphs (KGs) to establish dependencies among passages. However, they only leverage knowledge triples from existing KGs, which suffer from incompleteness and may lack certain information critical for answering given questions. To this end, in order to capture the dependencies between passages while tacking the issue of incompleteness in existing KGs, we propose to enhance the retrieval-augmented reader model with a knowledge graph generation module ( REANO ). Specifically, REANO consists of a KG generator and an answer predictor . The KG generator aims to generate KGs from the passages; the answer predictor then generates answers based on the passages and the generated KGs. Experimental results on five ODQA datasets indicate that compared with baselines, REANO 1 can improve the exact match score by up to 2 . 7% on the EntityQuestion dataset, with an average improvement of 1 . 8% across all the datasets.", "arxivid": ""}

Reasoning on graphs is essential for drawing inferences about the relationships between entities in a complex system, and to identify hidden patterns and trends. Despite the remarkable progress in automated reasoning with natural text, reasoning on graphs with large language models (LLMs) remains an understudied problem. In this work, we perform the first comprehensive study of encoding graph-structured data as text for consumption by LLMs. We show that LLM performance on graph reasoning tasks varies on three fundamental levels: (1) the graph encoding method, (2) the nature of the graph task itself, and (3) interestingly, the very structure of the graph considered. These novel results provide valuable insight on strategies for encoding graphs as text. Using these insights we illustrate how the correct choice of encoders can boost performance on graph reasoning tasks inside LLMs by 4.8% to 61.8%, depending on the task.", "arxivid": "2310.04560v1"}
{"title": "Knowledge Solver: Teaching LLMs to Search for Domain Knowledge from Knowledge Graphs", "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, are versatile and can solve different tasks due to their emergent ability and generalizability. However, LLMs sometimes lack domain-specific knowledge to perform tasks, which would also cause hallucination during inference. In some previous works, additional modules like graph neural networks (GNNs) are trained on retrieved knowledge from external knowledge bases, aiming to mitigate the problem of lacking domain-specific knowledge. However, incorporating additional modules: 1) would need retraining additional modules when encountering novel domains; 2) would become a bottleneck since LLMs' strong abilities are not fully utilized for retrieval. In this paper, we propose a paradigm, termed Knowledge Solver (KSL), to teach LLMs to search for essential knowledge from external knowledge bases by harnessing their own strong generalizability. Specifically, we design a simple yet effective prompt to transform retrieval into a multi-hop decision sequence, which empowers LLMs with searching knowledge ability in zero-shot manner. Additionally, KSL is able to provide complete retrieval paths and therefore increase explainability of LLMs' reasoning processes.

Knowledge graphs (KGs) have different entity and relation vocabularies that generally do not overlap. The key challenge of designing foundation models on KGs is to learn such transferable representations that enable inference on any graph with arbitrary entity and relation vocabularies. In this work, we make a step towards such foundation models and present ULTRA, an approach for learning universal and transferable graph representations. ULTRA builds relational representations as a function conditioned on their interactions. Such a conditioning strategy allows a pre-trained ULTRA model to inductively generalize to any unseen KG with any relation vocabulary and to be fine-tuned on any graph. Conducting link prediction experiments on 57 different KGs, we find that the zero-shot inductive inference performance of a single pre-trained ULTRA model on unseen graphs of various sizes is often on par or better than strong baselines trained on specific graphs. Fine-tuning further boosts the performance.", "arxivid": "2310.04562v2"}

To tackle this problem, we first propose to partition the retrieved KSG to several smaller sub-KSGs via a new subgraph partition algorithm and then present a graph-augmented learning to rank model to select the top-ranked sub-KSGs from them. Our proposed model combines a novel subgraph matching networks to capture global interactions in both question and subgraphs and an Enhanced Bilateral Multi-Perspective Matching model to capture local interactions.

This paper first proposes a novel generative temporal knowledge graph question answering framework, GenTKGQA, which guides LLMs to answer temporal questions through two phases: Subgraph Retrieval and Answer Generation. First, we exploit LLM's intrinsic knowledge to mine temporal constraints and structural links in the questions without extra training, thus narrowing down the subgraph search space in both temporal and structural dimensions. Next, we design virtual knowledge indicators to fuse the graph neural network signals of the subgraph and the text representations of the LLM in a non-shallow way, which helps the open-source LLM deeply understand the temporal order and structural dependencies among the retrieved facts through instruction tuning.

To facilitate the development of KBQA models with stronger generalization, we construct and release a new large-scale, high-quality dataset with 64,331 questions, GrailQA, and provide evaluation settings for all three levels of generalization.

Guiding LLMs to construct thought chains can enhance their deliberate reasoning abilities, but also faces challenges such as hallucination. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can provide explicit structured knowledge for LLMs to alleviate these issues. However, existing KG-enhanced methods often overlook explicit graph learning, making it challenging to efficiently provide precise reasoning chains for LLMs. Following dual-process theory, we propose Dual-Reasoning (DualR), a novel framework that integrates an external system based on Graph Neural Network (GNN) for explicit reasoning on KGs, complementing the implicit reasoning of LLMs through externalized reasoning chains. DualR designs an LLM-empowered GNN module for explicit learning on KGs, efficiently extracting high-quality reasoning chains. These reasoning chains are then refined to a knowledge-enhanced multiple-choice prompt, guiding a frozen LLM to reason thoughtfully for final answer determination. Extensive experiments on three benchmark KGQA datasets demonstrate that DualR achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high efficiency and interpretability.", "arxivid": ""}

{"title": "Knowledge Graph-Enhanced Large Language Models via Path Selection", "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown unprecedented performance in various real-world applications. However, they are known to generate factually inaccurate outputs, a.k.a. the hallucination problem. In recent years, incorporating external knowledge extracted from Knowledge Graphs (KGs) has become a promising strategy to improve the factual accuracy of LLM-generated outputs. Nevertheless, most existing explorations rely on LLMs themselves to perform KG knowledge extraction, which is highly inflexible as LLMs can only provide binary judgment on whether a certain knowledge (e.g., a knowledge path in KG) should be used. In addition, LLMs tend to pick only knowledge with direct semantic relationship with the input text, while potentially useful knowledge with indirect semantics can be ignored. In this work, we propose a principled framework KELP with three stages to handle the above problems. Specifically, KELP is able to achieve finer granularity of flexible knowledge extraction by generating scores for knowledge paths with input texts via latent semantic matching. Meanwhile, knowledge paths with indirect semantic relationships with the input text can also be considered via trained encoding between the selected paths in KG and the input text. Experiments on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of KELP.", "arxivid": "2406.13862v1"}

In particular, we observe that performance is often highest when relevant information occurs at the beginning or end of the input context, and significantly degrades when models must access relevant information in the middle of long contexts, even for explicitly long-context models.

{"title": "Improving Complex Knowledge Base Question Answering with Relation-Aware Subgraph Retrieval and Reasoning Network", "abstract": "Complex Knowledge Base Question Answering aims to answer a complex question over a Knowledge Base. A mainstream solution is based on information retrieval, which usually extracts a pivotal subgraph from entire Knowledge Base to locate candidate answers, and then determines the plausible answers with semantic matching between candidate answers and the question. However, such a paradigm can have two critical problems: 1) Complex Knowledge Base Question Answering can be sensitive to the subgraph, since a small subgraph may exclude the answers, while a large one may introduce a lot of noise; 2) directly deriving answers with semantic matching neglects the global topology in the Knowledge Base, which may limit the capability in answer reasoning. To tackle above challenges, we propose the Relation-Aware Subgraph Retrieval and Reasoning Network, where relations are emphasized to construct subgraphs and answer reasoning. Specifically, we present a Relation-Aware Subgraph Retrieval (RASR) method to initialize and prune subgraphs with the guidance of relation semantics. To compre-hensively understand the complex correlations between the question and candidate answers, we put forward a Relation-Aware Reasoning Network (RARN), which contains a text reasoning module focusing on the semantics understanding of the question and a graph reasoning module focusing on mining the topology between the topic entities and the answers.

However, if the derived instructions do not exactly match the underlying KG information, they may lead to reasoning under irrelevant context. Our method, termed ReaRev, introduces a new way to KGQA reasoning with respect to both instruction decoding and execution. To improve instruction decoding, we perform reasoning in an adaptive manner, where KG-aware information is used to iteratively update the initial instructions. To improve instruction execution, we emulate breadth-first search (BFS) with graph neural networks (GNNs).

In this work, we introduce GNN-RAG, a novel method for combining language understanding abilities of LLMs with the reasoning abilities of GNNs in a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) style. First, a GNN reasons over a dense KG subgraph to retrieve answer candidates for a given question.

Meanwhile, KGs are difficult to construct and evolve by nature, which challenges the existing methods in KGs to generate new facts and represent unseen knowledge. Therefore, it is complementary to unify LLMs and KGs together and, simultaneously, leverage their advantages. In this article, we present a forward-looking roadmap for the unification of LLMs and KGs. Our roadmap consists of three general frameworks, namely: 1) KG-enhanced LLMs, which incorporate KGs during the pre-training and inference phases of LLMs, or for the purpose of enhancing understanding of the knowledge learned by LLMs; 2) LLM-augmented KGs, that leverage LLMs for different KG tasks such as embedding, completion, construction, graph-to-text generation, and question answering; and 3) Synergized LLMs + KGs, in which LLMs and KGs play equal roles and work in a mutually beneficial way to enhance both LLMs and KGs for bidirectional reasoning driven by both data and knowledge. We review and summarize existing efforts within these three frameworks in our roadmap and pinpoint their future research directions.", "arxivid": "2306.08302v3"}
{"title": "Large Language Model based Long-tail Query Rewriting in Taobao Search", "abstract": "In the realm of e-commerce search, the significance of semantic matching cannot be overstated, as it directly impacts both user experience and company revenue. Along this line, query rewriting, serving as an important technique to bridge the semantic gaps inherent in the semantic matching process, has attached wide attention from the industry and academia. However, existing query rewriting methods often struggle to effectively optimize long-tail queries and alleviate the phenomenon of \"few recall'' caused by semantic gap. In this paper, we present BEQUE, a comprehensive framework that Bridges the sE mantic gap for long-tail QUE ries. In detail, BEQUE comprises three stages: multi-instruction supervised fine tuning (SFT), offline feedback, and objective alignment. We first construct a rewriting dataset based on rejection sampling and auxiliary tasks mixing to fine-tune our large language model (LLM) in a supervised fashion. Subsequently, with the well-trained LLM, we employ beam search to generate multiple candidate rewrites, and feed them into Taobao offline system to obtain the partial order. Leveraging the partial order of rewrites, we introduce a contrastive learning method to highlight the distinctions between rewrites, and align the model with the Taobao online objectives. Offline experiments prove the effectiveness of our method in bridging semantic gap. Online A/B tests reveal that our method can significantly boost gross merchandise volume (GMV), number of transaction (#Trans) and unique visitor (UV) for long-tail queries. BEQUE has been deployed on Taobao, one of most popular online shopping platforms in China, since October 2023.", "arxivid": "2311.03758v3"}

To catalyze research on models that condition on specific information in large textual resources, we present a benchmark for knowledge-intensive language tasks (KILT). All tasks in KILT are grounded in the same snapshot of Wikipedia, reducing engineering turnaround through the re-use of components, as well as accelerating research into task-agnostic memory architectures. We test both task-specific and general baselines, evaluating downstream performance in addition to the ability of the models to provide provenance.

Some models also incorporate knowledge bases without the need for pre-training. This is because the base model already contains domain-specific knowledge during the pre-training process. We build a large language model for food testing. Unlike the above approach, a significant amount of data in this domain exists in Scanning format for domain standard documents. In addition, there is a large amount of untrained structured knowledge. Therefore, we introduce an incremental pre-training step to inject this knowledge into a large language model. In this paper, we propose a method for handling structured knowledge and scanned documents in incremental pre-training. To overcome the problem of machine hallucination, we constructe a knowledge graph to serve as an external knowledge base for supporting retrieval in the large language model.

However, since the external knowledge base, as well as the retriever, can not guarantee reliability, potentially leading to the knowledge retrieved not being helpful or even misleading for LLM generation. In this paper, we introduce Supportiveness-based Knowledge Rewriting (SKR), a robust and pluggable knowledge rewriter inherently optimized for LLM generation. Specifically, we introduce the novel concept of\"supportiveness\"--which represents how effectively a knowledge piece facilitates downstream tasks--by considering the perplexity impact of augmented knowledge on the response text of a white-box LLM. Based on knowledge supportiveness, we first design a training data curation strategy for our rewriter model, effectively identifying and filtering out poor or irrelevant rewrites (e.g., with low supportiveness scores) to improve data efficacy. We then introduce the direct preference optimization (DPO) algorithm to align the generated rewrites to optimal supportiveness, guiding the rewriter model to summarize augmented content that better improves the final response. Comprehensive evaluations across six popular knowledge-intensive tasks and four LLMs have demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of SKR. With only 7B parameters, SKR has shown better knowledge rewriting capability over GPT-4, the current state-of-the-art general-purpose LLM.", "arxivid": ""}

Intelligence analysis is an example of a domain that can benefit tremendously from narrative construction techniques, particularly in aiding analysts during the largely manual and costly process of synthesizing event information into comprehensive intelligence reports. Manual intelligence report generation is often prone to challenges such as integrating dynamic event information, writing fine-grained queries, and closing information gaps. This motivates the development of a system that retrieves and represents critical aspects of events in a form that aids in automatic generation of intelligence reports. We introduce a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to augment prompting of an autoregressive decoder by retrieving structured information asserted in a knowledge graph to generate targeted information based on a narrative plot model. We apply our approach to the problem of neural intelligence report generation and introduce FABULA, framework to augment intelligence analysis workflows using RAG. An analyst can use FABULA to query an Event Plot Graph (EPG) to retrieve relevant event plot points, which can be used to augment prompting of a Large Language Model (LLM) during intelligence report generation.

The construction of BERT makes it unsuitable for semantic similarity search as well as for unsupervised tasks like clustering. In this publication, we present Sentence-BERT (SBERT), a modification of the pretrained BERT network that use siamese and triplet network structures to derive semantically meaningful sentence embeddings that can be compared using cosine-similarity. This reduces the effort for finding the most similar pair from 65 hours with BERT / RoBERTa to about 5 seconds with SBERT, while maintaining the accuracy from BERT.

{"title": "DropEdge: Towards Deep Graph Convolutional Networks on Node Classification", "abstract": "Over-fitting and over-smoothing are two main obstacles of developing deep Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for node classification. In particular, over-fitting weakens the generalization ability on small dataset, while over-smoothing impedes model training by isolating output representations from the input features with the increase in network depth. This paper proposes DropEdge, a novel and flexible technique to alleviate both issues. At its core, DropEdge randomly removes a certain number of edges from the input graph at each training epoch, acting like a data augmenter and also a message passing reducer. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate that DropEdge either retards the convergence speed of over-smoothing or relieves the information loss caused by it. More importantly, our DropEdge is a general skill that can be equipped with many other backbone models (e.g. GCN, ResGCN, GraphSAGE, and JKNet) for enhanced performance. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks verify that DropEdge consistently improves the performance on a variety of both shallow and deep GCNs. The effect of DropEdge on preventing over-smoothing is empirically visualized and validated as well. Codes will be made public upon the publication.", "arxivid": "1907.10903v4"}

Goal of the Question Answering over KG (KGQA) task is to answer natural language queries posed over the KG. Multi-hop KGQA requires reasoning over multiple edges of the KG to arrive at the right answer. KGs are often incomplete with many missing links, posing additional challenges for KGQA, especially for multi-hop KGQA. Recent research on multi-hop KGQA has attempted to handle KG sparsity using relevant external text, which isn’t always readily available. In a separate line of research, KG embedding methods have been proposed to reduce KG sparsity by performing missing link prediction. Such KG embedding methods, even though highly relevant, have not been explored for multi-hop KGQA so far. We fill this gap in this paper and propose EmbedKGQA. EmbedKGQA is particularly effective in performing multi-hop KGQA over sparse KGs. EmbedKGQA also relaxes the requirement of answer selection from a pre-specified neighborhood, a sub-optimal constraint enforced by previous multi-hop KGQA methods.

We describe PullNet, an integrated framework for (1) learning what to retrieve and (2) reasoning with this heterogeneous information to find the best answer. PullNet uses an iterative process to construct a question-specific subgraph that contains information relevant to the question. In each iteration, a graph convolutional network (graph CNN) is used to identify subgraph nodes that should be expanded using retrieval (or “pull”) operations on the corpus and/or KB. After the subgraph is complete, another graph CNN is used to extract the answer from the subgraph. This retrieve-and-reason process allows us to answer multi-hop questions using large KBs and corpora. PullNet is weakly supervised, requiring question-answer pairs but not gold inference paths.

We use a number of well-designed experiments to examine and illustrate the following advantages of ToG: 1) compared with LLMs, ToG has better deep reasoning power; 2) ToG has the ability of knowledge traceability and knowledge correctability by leveraging LLMs reasoning and expert feedback; 3) ToG provides a flexible plug-and-play framework for different LLMs, KGs and prompting strategies without any additional training cost; 4) the performance of ToG with small LLM models could exceed large LLM such as GPT-4 in certain scenarios and this reduces the cost of LLM deployment and application.

While LLMs have advanced the state-of-the-art on these tasks with structure implications, whether LLMs could explicitly process textual descriptions of graphs and structures, map them to grounded conceptual spaces, and perform structured operations remains underexplored. To this end, we propose NLGraph (Natural Language Graph), a comprehensive benchmark of graph-based problem solving designed in natural language. NLGraph contains 29,370 problems, covering eight graph reasoning tasks with varying complexity from simple tasks such as connectivity and shortest path up to complex problems such as maximum flow and simulating graph neural networks. We evaluate LLMs (GPT-3/4) with various prompting approaches on the NLGraph benchmark and find that 1) language models do demonstrate preliminary graph reasoning abilities, 2) the benefit of advanced prompting and in-context learning diminishes on more complex graph problems, while 3) LLMs are also (un)surprisingly brittle in the face of spurious correlations in graph and problem settings. We then propose Build-a-Graph Prompting and Algorithmic Prompting, two instruction-based approaches to enhance LLMs in solving natural language graph problems. Build-a-Graph and Algorithmic prompting improve the performance of LLMs on NLGraph by 3.07% to 16.85% across multiple tasks and settings, while how to solve the most complicated graph reasoning tasks in our setup with language models remains an open research question.

Even so, suffering from hallucinations and the inability to access external knowledge, LLMs often come with incorrect or unfaithful intermediate reasoning steps, especially in the context of answering knowledge-intensive tasks such as KBQA. To alleviate this issue, we propose a framework called Knowledge-Driven Chain-of-Thought (KD-CoT) to verify and modify reasoning traces in CoT via interaction with external knowledge, and thus overcome the hallucinations and error propagation. Concretely, we formulate the CoT rationale process of LLMs into a structured multi-round QA format. In each round, LLMs interact with a QA system that retrieves external knowledge and produce faithful reasoning traces based on retrieved precise answers. The structured CoT reasoning of LLMs is facilitated by our developed KBQA CoT collection, which serves as in-context learning demonstrations and can also be utilized as feedback augmentation to train a robust retriever. Extensive experiments on WebQSP and ComplexWebQuestion datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed KD-CoT in task-solving reasoning generation, which outperforms the vanilla CoT ICL with an absolute success rate of 8.0% and 5.1%.

Those enriched action records are vital to understand users’ interests and intents. Recently, prior works for user behavior prediction mainly focus on the interactions with product-side information. However, the interactions with search queries, which usually act as a bridge between users and products, are still under investigated. In this paper, we explore a new problem named temporal event forecasting, a generalized user behavior prediction task in a unified query product evolutionary graph, to embrace both query and product recommendation in a temporal manner. To fulfill this setting, there involves two challenges: (1) the action data for most users is scarce; (2) user preferences are dynamically evolving and shifting over time. To tackle those issues, we propose a novel Retrieval-Enhanced Temporal Event (RETE) forecasting framework. Unlike existing methods that enhance user representations via roughly absorbing information from connected entities in the whole graph, RETE efficiently and dynamically retrieves relevant entities centrally on each user as high-quality subgraphs, preventing the noise propagation from the densely evolutionary graph structures that incorporate abundant search queries. And meanwhile, RETE autoregressively accumulates retrieval-enhanced user representations from each time step, to capture evolutionary patterns for joint query and product prediction.

However, in many domain-specific evaluations, these LLMs often suffer from hallucination problems due to insufficient training of relevant corpus. Furthermore, fine-tuning large models may face problems such as the LLMs are not open source or the construction of high-quality domain instruction is difficult. Therefore, structured knowledge databases such as knowledge graph can better provide domain background knowledge for LLMs and make full use of the reasoning and analysis capabilities of LLMs. In some previous works, LLM was called multiple times to determine whether the current triplet was suitable for inclusion in the subgraph when retrieving subgraphs through a question. Especially for the question that require a multi-hop reasoning path, frequent calls to LLM will consume a lot of computing power. Moreover, when choosing the reasoning path, LLM will be called once for each step, and if one of the steps is selected incorrectly, it will lead to the accumulation of errors in the following steps. In this paper, we proposed an method of reasoning on efficient knowledge paths (RoK). This method can integrated and optimized the pipeline for selecting reasoning paths from KG based on LLM, which can reduce the dependency on LLM. In addition, we propose a simple and effective subgraph retrieval method based on chain of thought (CoT) and page rank which can returns the paths most likely to contain the answer. We conduct experiments on three datasets: GenMedGPT-5k [14], WebQuestions [2], and CMCQA [21].

However, few works explore this paradigm in multi-document question answering (MD-QA), a task demanding a thorough understanding of the logical associations among the contents and structures of documents. To fill this crucial gap, we propose a Knowledge Graph Prompting (KGP) method to formulate the right context in prompting LLMs for MD-QA, which consists of a graph construction module and a graph traversal module. For graph construction, we create a knowledge graph (KG) over multiple documents with nodes symbolizing passages or document structures (e.g., pages/tables), and edges denoting the semantic/lexical similarity between passages or document structural relations. For graph traversal, we design an LLM-based graph traversal agent that navigates across nodes and gathers supporting passages assisting LLMs in MD-QA. The constructed graph serves as the global ruler that regulates the transitional space among passages and reduces retrieval latency. Concurrently, the graph traversal agent acts as a local navigator that gathers pertinent context to progressively approach the question and guarantee retrieval quality. Extensive experiments underscore the efficacy of KGP for MD-QA, signifying the potential of leveraging graphs in enhancing the prompt design and retrieval augmented generation for LLMs. Our code: https://github.com/YuWVandy/KG-LLM-MDQA.", "arxivid": "2308.11730v3"}

Our approach first uses a contrastive ranker to rank a set of candidate logical forms obtained by searching over the knowledge graph. It then introduces a tailored generation model conditioned on the question and the top-ranked candidates to compose the final logical form. We achieve new state-of-the-art results on GrailQA and WebQSP datasets. In particular, our method surpasses the prior state-of-the-art by a large margin on the GrailQA leaderboard. In addition, RnG-KBQA outperforms all prior approaches on the popular WebQSP benchmark, even including the ones that use the oracle entity linking. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the interplay between ranking and generation, which leads to the superior performance of our proposed approach across all settings with especially strong improvements in zero-shot generalization.", "arxivid": "2109.08678v2"}

In particular, (1) unlike previous studies on small-scale datasets, we show that learning from labeled semantic parses significantly improves overall performance, resulting in absolute 5 point gain compared to learning from answers, (2) we show that with an appropriate user interface, one can obtain semantic parses with high accuracy and at a cost comparable or lower than obtaining just answers, and (3) we have created and shared the largest semantic-parse labeled dataset to date in order to advance research in question answering.", "arxivid": ""}
{"title": "DecAF: Joint Decoding of Answers and Logical Forms for Question Answering over Knowledge Bases", "abstract": "Question answering over knowledge bases (KBs) aims to answer natural language questions with factual information such as entities and relations in KBs. Previous methods either generate logical forms that can be executed over KBs to obtain final answers or predict answers directly. Empirical results show that the former often produces more accurate answers, but it suffers from non-execution issues due to potential syntactic and semantic errors in the generated logical forms. In this work, we propose a novel framework DecAF that jointly generates both logical forms and direct answers, and then combines the merits of them to get the final answers. Moreover, different from most of the previous methods, DecAF is based on simple free-text retrieval without relying on any entity linking tools -- this simplification eases its adaptation to different datasets. DecAF achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy on WebQSP, FreebaseQA, and GrailQA benchmarks, while getting competitive results on the ComplexWebQuestions benchmark.", "arxivid": "2210.00063v2"}
{"title": "KG-FiD: Infusing Knowledge Graph in Fusion-in-Decoder for Open-Domain Question Answering", "abstract": "Current Open-Domain Question Answering (ODQA) models typically include a retrieving module and a reading module, where the retriever selects potentially relevant passages from open-source documents for a given question, and the reader produces an answer based on the retrieved passages. The recently proposed Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD) framework is a representative example, which is built on top of a dense passage retriever and a generative reader, achieving the state-of-the-art performance. In this paper we further improve the FiD approach by introducing a knowledge-enhanced version, namely KG-FiD. Our new model uses a knowledge graph to establish the structural relationship among the retrieved passages, and a graph neural network (GNN) to re-rank the passages and select only a top few for further processing. Our experiments on common ODQA benchmark datasets (Natural Questions and TriviaQA) demonstrate that KG-FiD can achieve comparable or better performance in answer prediction than FiD, with less than 40% of the computation cost.", "arxivid": "2110.04330v2"}

Numerous studies and real-world applications are leveraging its ability to enhance generative models through external information retrieval.

To better understand these challenges, we conduct A Unified Evaluation Process of RAG (Auepora) and aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the evaluation and benchmarks of RAG systems. Specifically, we examine and compare several quantifiable metrics of the Retrieval and Generation components, such as relevance, accuracy, and faithfulness, within the current RAG benchmarks, encompassing the possible output and ground truth pairs. We then analyze the various datasets and metrics, discuss the limitations of current benchmarks, and suggest potential directions to advance the field of RAG benchmarks.", "arxivid": "2405.07437v2"}
{"title": "Subgraph Retrieval Enhanced Model for Multi-hop Knowledge Base Question Answering", "abstract": "Recent works on knowledge base question answering (KBQA) retrieve subgraphs for easier reasoning. The desired subgraph is crucial as a small one may exclude the answer but a large one might introduce more noises. However, the existing retrieval is either heuristic or interwoven with the reasoning, causing reasoning on the partial subgraphs, which increases the reasoning bias when the intermediate supervision is missing. This paper proposes a trainable subgraph retriever (SR) decoupled from the subsequent reasoning process, which enables a plug-and-play framework to enhance any subgraph-oriented KBQA model. Extensive experiments demonstrate SR achieves significantly better retrieval and QA performance than existing retrieval methods. Via weakly supervised pre-training as well as the end-to-end fine-tuning, SR achieves new state-of-the-art performance when combined with NSM (He et al., 2021), a subgraph-oriented reasoner, for embedding-based KBQA methods.

{"title": "GraphTranslator: Aligning Graph Model to Large Language Model for Open-ended Tasks", "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, exhibit powerful zero-shot and instruction-following capabilities, have catalyzed a revolutionary transformation across diverse fields, especially for open-ended tasks. While the idea is less explored in the graph domain, despite the availability of numerous powerful graph models (GMs), they are restricted to tasks in a pre-defined form. Although several methods applying LLMs to graphs have been proposed, they fail to simultaneously handle the pre-defined and open-ended tasks, with LLM as a node feature enhancer or as a standalone predictor. To break this dilemma, we propose to bridge the pretrained GM and LLM by a Translator, named GraphTranslator, aiming to leverage GM to handle the pre-defined tasks effectively and utilize the extended interface of LLMs to offer various open-ended tasks for GM. To train such Translator, we propose a Producer capable of constructing the graph-text alignment data along node information, neighbor information and model information. By translating node representation into tokens, GraphTranslator empowers an LLM to make predictions based on language instructions, providing a unified perspective for both pre-defined and open-ended tasks. Extensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed GraphTranslator on zero-shot node classification. The graph question answering experiments reveal our GraphTranslator potential across a broad spectrum of open-ended tasks through language instructions.

{"title": "KnowGPT: Knowledge Graph based Prompting for Large Language Models", "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in many real-world applications. Nonetheless, LLMs are often criticized for their tendency to produce hallucinations, wherein the models fabricate incorrect statements on tasks beyond their knowledge and perception. To alleviate this issue, researchers have explored leveraging the factual knowledge in knowledge graphs (KGs) to ground the LLM's responses in established facts and principles. However, most state-of-the-art LLMs are closed-source, making it challenging to develop a prompting framework that can efficiently and effectively integrate KGs into LLMs with hard prompts only. Generally, existing KG-enhanced LLMs usually suffer from three critical issues, including huge search space, high API costs, and laborious prompt engineering, that impede their widespread application in practice. To this end, we introduce a novel Knowledge Graph based PrompTing framework, namely KnowGPT, to enhance LLMs with domain knowledge. KnowGPT contains a knowledge extraction module to extract the most informative knowledge from KGs, and a context-aware prompt construction module to automatically convert extracted knowledge into effective prompts. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that KnowGPT significantly outperforms all competitors. Notably, KnowGPT achieves a 92.6% accuracy on OpenbookQA leaderboard, comparable to human-level performance.", "arxivid": "2312.06185v5"}
{"title": "GreaseLM: Graph REASoning Enhanced Language Models", "abstract": "Answering complex questions about textual narratives requires reasoning over both stated context and the world knowledge that underlies it. However, pretrained language models (LM), the foundation of most modern QA systems, do not robustly represent latent relationships between concepts, which is necessary for reasoning. While knowledge graphs (KG) are often used to augment LMs with structured representations of world knowledge, it remains an open question how to effectively fuse and reason over the KG representations and the language context, which provides situational constraints and nuances. In this work, we propose GreaseLM, a new model that fuses encoded representations from pretrained LMs and graph neural networks over multiple layers of modality interaction operations. Information from both modalities propagates to the other, allowing language context representations to be grounded by structured world knowledge, and allowing linguistic nuances (e.g., negation, hedging) in the context to inform the graph representations of knowledge. Our results on three benchmarks in the commonsense reasoning (i.e., CommonsenseQA, OpenbookQA) and medical question answering (i.e., MedQA-USMLE) domains demonstrate that GreaseLM can more reliably answer questions that require reasoning over both situational constraints and structured knowledge, even outperforming models 8x larger.", "arxivid": "2201.08860v1"}
{"title": "Variational Reasoning for Question Answering With Knowledge Graph", "abstract": "Knowledge graph (KG) is known to be helpful for the task of question answering (QA), since it provides well-structured relational information between entities, and allows one to further infer indirect facts. However, it is challenging to build QA systems which can learn to reason over knowledge graphs based on question-answer pairs alone. First, when people ask questions, their expressions are noisy (for example, typos in texts, or variations in pronunciations), which is non-trivial for the QA system to match those mentioned entities to the knowledge graph. Second, many questions require multi-hop logic reasoning over the knowledge graph to retrieve the answers. To address these challenges, we propose a novel and unified deep learning architecture, and an end-to-end variational learning algorithm which can handle noise in questions, and learn multi-hop reasoning simultaneously. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a recent benchmark dataset in the literature. We also derive a series of new benchmark datasets, including questions for multi-hop reasoning, questions paraphrased by neural translation model, and questions in human voice. Our method yields very promising results on all these challenging datasets.", "arxivid": "1709.04071v5"}
{"title": "GraphText: Graph Reasoning in Text Space", "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained the ability to assimilate human knowledge and facilitate natural language interactions with both humans and other LLMs. However, despite their impressive achievements, LLMs have not made significant advancements in the realm of graph machine learning. This limitation arises because graphs encapsulate distinct relational data, making it challenging to transform them into natural language that LLMs understand. In this paper, we bridge this gap with a novel framework, GraphText, that translates graphs into natural language. GraphText derives a graph-syntax tree for each graph that encapsulates both the node attributes and inter-node relationships. Traversal of the tree yields a graph text sequence, which is then processed by an LLM to treat graph tasks as text generation tasks. Notably, GraphText offers multiple advantages. It introduces training-free graph reasoning: even without training on graph data, GraphText with ChatGPT can achieve on par with, or even surpassing, the performance of supervised-trained graph neural networks through in-context learning (ICL). Furthermore, GraphText paves the way for interactive graph reasoning, allowing both humans and LLMs to communicate with the model seamlessly using natural language. These capabilities underscore the vast, yet-to-be-explored potential of LLMs in the domain of graph machine learning.", "arxivid": "2310.01089v1"}
{"title": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation for AI-Generated Content: A Survey", "abstract": "Advancements in model algorithms, the growth of foundational models, and access to high-quality datasets have propelled the evolution of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC). Despite its notable successes, AIGC still faces hurdles such as updating knowledge, handling long-tail data, mitigating data leakage, and managing high training and inference costs. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently emerged as a paradigm to address such challenges. In particular, RAG introduces the information retrieval process, which enhances the generation process by retrieving relevant objects from available data stores, leading to higher accuracy and better robustness. In this paper, we comprehensively review existing efforts that integrate RAG technique into AIGC scenarios. We first classify RAG foundations according to how the retriever augments the generator, distilling the fundamental abstractions of the augmentation methodologies for various retrievers and generators. This unified perspective encompasses all RAG scenarios, illuminating advancements and pivotal technologies that help with potential future progress. We also summarize additional enhancements methods for RAG, facilitating effective engineering and implementation of RAG systems.

{"title": "Efficient Tuning and Inference for Large Language Models on Textual Graphs", "abstract": "Rich textual and topological information of textual graphs need to be modeled in real-world applications such as webpages, e-commerce, and academic articles. Practitioners have been long following the path of adopting a shallow text encoder and a subsequent graph neural network (GNN) to solve this problem. In light of recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), it is apparent that integrating LLMs for enhanced textual encoding can substantially improve the performance of textual graphs. Nevertheless, the efficiency of these methods poses a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose ENGINE, a parameter- and memory-efficient fine-tuning method for textual graphs with an LLM encoder. The key insight is to combine the LLMs and GNNs through a tunable side structure, which significantly reduces the training complexity without impairing the joint model's capacity. Extensive experiments on textual graphs demonstrate our method's effectiveness by achieving the best model performance, meanwhile having the lowest training cost compared to previous methods. Moreover, we introduce two variants with caching and dynamic early exit to further enhance training and inference speed. Specifically, caching accelerates ENGINE's training by 12x, and dynamic early exit achieves up to 5x faster inference with a negligible performance drop (at maximum 1.17% relevant drop across 7 datasets).
