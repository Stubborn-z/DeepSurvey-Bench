Data with underlying graph structure can be found across many disciplines and there is a natural desire for understanding such data better. Deep learning (DL) has achieved significant breakthroughs in a variety of machine learning tasks in recent years, especially where data is structured on a grid, such as in text, speech, or image understanding. However, surprisingly little has been done to explore the applicability of DL on arbitrary graph-structured data directly. The goal of this thesis is to investigate architectures for DL on graphs and study how to transfer, adapt or generalize concepts that work well on sequential and image data to this domain. We concentrate on two important primitives: embedding graphs or their nodes into a continuous vector space representation (encoding) and, conversely, generating graphs from such vectors back (decoding). To that end, we make the following contributions. First, we introduce Edge-Conditioned Convolutions (ECC), a convolution-like operation on graphs performed in the spatial domain where filters are dynamically generated based on edge attributes. The method is used to encode graphs with arbitrary and varying structure. Second, we propose SuperPoint Graph, an intermediate point cloud representation with rich edge attributes encoding the contextual relationship between object parts. Based on this representation, ECC is employed to segment large-scale point clouds without major sacrifice in fine details. Third, we present GraphVAE, a graph generator allowing us to decode graphs with variable but upper-bounded number of nodes making use of approximate graph matching for aligning the predictions of an autoencoder with its inputs. The method is applied to the task of molecule generation."}

The core concept of GNNs is to find a representation by recursively aggregating the representations of a central node and those of its neighbors. The core concept of GNNs is to find a representation by recursively aggregating the representations of a central node and those of its neighbor, and its success has been demonstrated by many GNNs' designs. However, most of them only focus on using the first-order information between a node and its neighbors. In this paper, we introduce a central node permutation variant function through a frustratingly simple and innocent-looking modification to the core operation of a GNN, namely the Feature cOrrelation aGgregation (FOG) module which learns the second-order information from feature correlation between a node and its neighbors in the pipeline. By adding FOG into existing variants of GNNs, we empirically verify this second-order information complements the features generated by original GNNs across a broad set of benchmarks. A tangible boost in performance of the model is observed where the model surpasses previous state-of-the-art results by a significant margin while employing fewer parameters. (e.g., 33.116% improvement on a real-world molecular dataset using graph convolutional networks)."}

While traditional methods employ single-time retrieval, more recent approaches have shifted towards multi-time retrieval for multi-hop reasoning tasks. However, these strategies are bound by predefined reasoning steps, potentially leading to inaccuracies in response generation. This paper introduces MetaRAG, an approach that combines the retrieval-augmented generation process with metacognition. Drawing from cognitive psychology, metacognition allows an entity to self-reflect and critically evaluate its cognitive processes. By integrating this, MetaRAG enables the model to monitor, evaluate, and plan its response strategies, enhancing its introspective reasoning abilities. Through a three-step metacognitive regulation pipeline, the model can identify inadequacies in initial cognitive responses and fixes them. Empirical evaluations show that MetaRAG significantly outperforms existing methods."}

A common consideration for scoring similarity is the maximum common subgraph (MCS) between the query and corpus graphs, usually counting the number of common edges (i.e., MCES). In some applications, it is also desirable that the common subgraph be connected, i.e., the maximum common connected subgraph (MCCS). Finding exact MCES and MCCS is intractable, but may be unnecessary if ranking corpus graphs by relevance is the goal. We design fast and trainable neural functions that approximate MCES and MCCS well. Late interaction methods compute dense representations for the query and corpus graph separately, and compare these representations using simple similarity functions at the last stage, leading to highly scalable systems. Early interaction methods combine information from both graphs right from the input stages, are usually considerably more accurate, but slower. We propose both late and early interaction neural MCES and MCCS formulations. They are both based on a continuous relaxation of a node alignment matrix between query and corpus nodes. For MCCS, we propose a novel differentiable network for estimating the size of the largest connected common subgraph. Extensive experiments with seven data sets show that our proposals are superior among late interaction models in terms of both accuracy and speed. Our early interaction models provide accuracy competitive with the state of the art, at substantially greater speeds."}

In this paper, we propose the 'Blended RAG' method of leveraging semantic search techniques, such as Dense Vector indexes and Sparse Encoder indexes, blended with hybrid query strategies. Our study achieves better retrieval results and sets new benchmarks for IR (Information Retrieval) datasets like NQ and TREC-COVID datasets. We further extend such a 'Blended Retriever' to the RAG system to demonstrate far superior results on Generative Q\\&A datasets like SQUAD, even surpassing fine-tuning performance."}

This has been due, in part, to cheap data and cheap compute resources, which have fit the natural strengths of deep learning. However, many defining characteristics of human intelligence, which developed under much different pressures, remain out of reach for current approaches. In particular, generalizing beyond one's experiences--a hallmark of human intelligence from infancy--remains a formidable challenge for modern AI. The following is part position paper, part review, and part unification. We argue that combinatorial generalization must be a top priority for AI to achieve human-like abilities, and that structured representations and computations are key to realizing this objective. Just as biology uses nature and nurture cooperatively, we reject the false choice between \"hand-engineering\" and \"end-to-end\" learning, and instead advocate for an approach which benefits from their complementary strengths. We explore how using relational inductive biases within deep learning architectures can facilitate learning about entities, relations, and rules for composing them. We present a new building block for the AI toolkit with a strong relational inductive bias--the graph network--which generalizes and extends various approaches for neural networks that operate on graphs, and provides a straightforward interface for manipulating structured knowledge and producing structured behaviors. We discuss how graph networks can support relational reasoning and combinatorial generalization, laying the foundation for more sophisticated, interpretable, and flexible patterns of reasoning. As a companion to this paper, we have released an open-source software library for building graph networks, with demonstrations of how to use them in practice."}

In terms of graph-based domain applications, such as embeddings and graph neural networks, current research is increasingly taking into account the time-related evolution of the information encoded within a graph. Algorithms and models for stationary and static knowledge graphs are extended to make them accessible for time-aware domains, where time-awareness can be interpreted in different ways. In particular, a distinction needs to be made between the validity period and the traceability of facts as objectives of time-related knowledge graph extensions. In this context, terms and definitions such as dynamic and temporal are often used inconsistently or interchangeably in the literature. Therefore, with this paper we aim to provide a short but well-defined overview of time-aware knowledge graph extensions and thus faciliate future research in this field as well."}

Temporal KGs(TKGs) extend traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) by associating static triples with timestamps forming quadruples. Different from KGs and TKGs in the transductive setting, constantly emerging entities and relations in incomplete TKGs create demand to predict missing facts with unseen components, which is the extrapolation setting. Traditional temporal knowledge graph embedding (TKGE) methods are limited in the extrapolation setting since they are trained within a fixed set of components. In this paper, we propose a Meta-Learning based Temporal Knowledge Graph Extrapolation (MTKGE) model, which is trained on link prediction tasks sampled from the existing TKGs and tested in the emerging TKGs with unseen entities and relations. Specifically, we meta-train a GNN framework that captures relative position patterns and temporal sequence patterns between relations. The learned embeddings of patterns can be transferred to embed unseen components. Experimental results on two different TKG extrapolation datasets show that MTKGE consistently outperforms both the existing state-of-the-art models for knowledge graph extrapolation and specifically adapted KGE and TKGE baselines."}

However, most MKGs are still far from complete, which motivates the flourishing of MKG reasoning models. Recently, with the development of general artificial architectures, the pretrained transformer models have drawn increasing attention, especially for multimodal scenarios. However, the research of multimodal pretrained transformer (MPT) for knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) is still at an early stage. As the biggest difference between MKG and other multimodal data, the rich structural information underlying the MKG still cannot be fully leveraged in existing MPT models. Most of them only utilize the graph structure as a retrieval map for matching images and texts connected with the same entity. This manner hinders their reasoning performances. To this end, we propose the graph Structure Guided Multimodal Pretrained Transformer for knowledge graph reasoning, termed SGMPT. Specifically, the graph structure encoder is adopted for structural feature encoding. Then, a structure-guided fusion module with two different strategies, i.e., weighted summation and alignment constraint, is first designed to inject the structural information into both the textual and visual features. To the best of our knowledge, SGMPT is the first MPT model for multimodal KGR, which mines the structural information underlying the knowledge graph. Extensive experiments on FB15k-237-IMG and WN18-IMG, demonstrate that our SGMPT outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, and prove the effectiveness of the designed strategies."}

The ratio of selected nodes and edges can be specified to trade off between performance and efficiency. Experiments on both transductive and inductive knowledge graph reasoning benchmarks show that A*Net achieves competitive performance with existing state-of-the-art path-based methods, while merely visiting 10% nodes and 10% edges at each iteration.

The integration of KGs with neuronal learning (e.g., Large Language Models (LLMs)) is currently a topic of active research, commonly named neuro-symbolic AI. Despite the numerous benefits that can be accomplished with KG-based AI, its growing ubiquity within online services may result in the loss of self-determination for citizens as a fundamental societal issue. The more we rely on these technologies, which are often centralised, the less citizens will be able to determine their own destinies. To counter this threat, AI regulation, such as the European Union (EU) AI Act, is being proposed in certain regions. The regulation sets what technologists need to do, leading to questions concerning: How can the output of AI systems be trusted? What is needed to ensure that the data fuelling and the inner workings of these artefacts are transparent? How can AI be made accountable for its decision-making?

In this work, we show how to seamlessly combine nearly any GNN model with the computational capabilities of GDBs. For this, we observe that the majority of these systems are based on, or support, a graph data model called the Labeled Property Graph (LPG), where vertices and edges can have arbitrarily complex sets of labels and properties. We then develop LPG2vec, an encoder that transforms an arbitrary LPG dataset into a representation that can be directly used with a broad class of GNNs, including convolutional, attentional, message-passing, and even higher-order or spectral models. In our evaluation, we show that the rich information represented as LPG labels and properties is properly preserved by LPG2vec, and it increases the accuracy of predictions regardless of the targeted learning task or the used GNN model, by up to 34% compared to graphs with no LPG labels/properties. In general, LPG2vec enables combining predictive power of the most powerful GNNs with the full scope of information encoded in the LPG model, paving the way for neural graph databases, a class of systems where the vast complexity of maintained data will benefit from modern and future graph machine learning methods."}

In recent years, hyperbolic (negative curvature) and spherical (positive curvature) representation methods have shown their superiority to capture hierarchical and cyclic data structures respectively. However, in industrial scenarios such as e-commerce sponsored search platforms, the large-scale heterogeneous query-item-advertisement interaction graphs often have multiple structures coexisting.

Specifically, entities are represented in adaptive mixed-curvature spaces, where the types and curvatures of the subspaces are trained to be optimal combinations. Besides, an attentive edge-wise space projector is designed to model the similarities between heterogeneous nodes according to local graph structures and the relation types.

These candidate items are then ranked and pruned in later stages of recommender systems using a more complex ranking model. As the top of the recommendation funnel, it is important to retrieve a high-recall candidate set to feed into downstream ranking models. A common approach is to leverage approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search from a single dense query embedding; however, this approach this can yield a low-diversity result set with many near duplicates. As users often have multiple interests, candidate retrieval should ideally return a diverse set of candidates reflective of the user's multiple interests. To this end, we introduce kNN-Embed, a general approach to improving diversity in dense ANN-based retrieval. kNN-Embed represents each user as a smoothed mixture over learned item clusters that represent distinct \"interests\" of the user. By querying each of a user's mixture component in proportion to their mixture weights, we retrieve a high-diversity set of candidates reflecting elements from each of a user's interests. We experimentally compare kNN-Embed to standard ANN candidate retrieval, and show significant improvements in overall recall and improved diversity across three datasets.

However, their immense size has required graph learning systems to assist humans in analysis, interpretation, and pattern detection. While there have been promising results for researcher- and clinician- empowerment through a variety of KG learning systems, we identify four key deficiencies in state-of-the-art graph learning that simultaneously limit KG learning performance and diminish the ability of humans to interface optimally with these learning systems. These deficiencies are: 1) lack of expert knowledge integration, 2) instability to node degree extremity in the KG, 3) lack of consideration for uncertainty and relevance while learning, and 4) lack of explainability. Furthermore, we characterise state-of-the-art attempts to solve each of these problems and note that each attempt has largely been isolated from attempts to solve the other problems. Through a formalisation of these problems and a review of the literature that addresses them, we adopt the position that not only are deficiencies in these four key areas holding back human-KG empowerment, but that the divide-and-conquer approach to solving these problems as individual units rather than a whole is a significant barrier to the interface between humans and KG learning systems. We propose that it is only through integrated, holistic solutions to the limitations of KG learning systems that human and KG learning co-empowerment will be efficiently affected.

One critical challenge of KG inductive reasoning is handling low-resource scenarios with scarcity in both textual and structural aspects. In this paper, we attempt to address this challenge with Large Language Models (LLMs). Particularly, we utilize the state-of-the-art LLMs to generate a graph-structural prompt to enhance the pre-trained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which brings us new methodological insights into the KG inductive reasoning methods, as well as high generalizability in practice. On the methodological side, we introduce a novel pretraining and prompting framework ProLINK, designed for low-resource inductive reasoning across arbitrary KGs without requiring additional training. On the practical side, we experimentally evaluate our approach on 36 low-resource KG datasets and find that ProLINK outperforms previous methods in three-shot, one-shot, and zero-shot reasoning tasks, exhibiting average performance improvements by 20%, 45%, and 147%, respectively. Furthermore, ProLINK demonstrates strong robustness for various LLM promptings as well as full-shot scenarios."}

Although knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models have demonstrated superior predictive performance on KGC tasks, these models infer missing links in a black-box manner that lacks transparency and accountability, preventing researchers from developing accountable models. Existing KGE-based explanation methods focus on exploring key paths or isolated edges as explanations, which is information-less to reason target prediction. Additionally, the missing ground truth leads to these explanation methods being ineffective in quantitatively evaluating explored explanations. To overcome these limitations, we propose KGExplainer, a model-agnostic method that identifies connected subgraph explanations and distills an evaluator to assess them quantitatively. KGExplainer employs a perturbation-based greedy search algorithm to find key connected subgraphs as explanations within the local structure of target predictions. To evaluate the quality of the explored explanations, KGExplainer distills an evaluator from the target KGE model. By forwarding the explanations to the evaluator, our method can examine the fidelity of them. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that KGExplainer yields promising improvement and achieves an optimal ratio of 83.3% in human evaluation."}

Aligning KGs across different domains and providers is necessary to afford a fuller and integrated representation. A severe limitation of current KG alignment (KGA) algorithms is that they fail to articulate logical thinking and reasoning with lexical, structural, and semantic data learning. Deep learning models are increasingly popular for KGA inspired by their good performance in other tasks, but they suffer from limitations in explainability, reasoning, and data efficiency. Hybrid neurosymbolic learning models hold the promise of integrating logical and data perspectives to produce high-quality alignments that are explainable and support validation through human-centric approaches. This paper examines the current state of the art in KGA and explores the potential for neurosymbolic integration, highlighting promising research directions for combining these fields."}

When it comes to incorporating contexts, conventional methods often rely on rules or basic machine learning models, which may not fully grasp the complexity and fluidity of context information. This research suggests an approach based on reinforcement learning (RL), specifically utilizing Deep Q Networks (DQN) to enhance the process of integrating contexts into knowledge graphs. By considering the state of the knowledge graph as environment states defining actions as operations for integrating contexts and using a reward function to gauge the improvement in knowledge graph quality post-integration, this method aims to automatically develop strategies for optimal context integration. Our DQN model utilizes networks as function approximators, continually updating Q values to estimate the action value function, thus enabling effective integration of intricate and dynamic context information. Initial experimental findings show that our RL method outperforms techniques in achieving precise context integration across various standard knowledge graph datasets, highlighting the potential and effectiveness of reinforcement learning in enhancing and managing knowledge graphs."}

However, KG edge (fact) sparsity and noisy edge extraction/generation often hinder models from obtaining useful knowledge to reason over. To address these issues, we propose a new KG-augmented model: Hybrid Graph Network (HGN). Unlike prior methods, HGN learns to jointly contextualize extracted and generated knowledge by reasoning over both within a unified graph structure. Given the task input context and an extracted KG subgraph, HGN is trained to generate embeddings for the subgraph's missing edges to form a \"hybrid\" graph, then reason over the hybrid graph while filtering out context-irrelevant edges. We demonstrate HGN's effectiveness through considerable performance gains across four commonsense reasoning benchmarks, plus a user study on edge validness and helpfulness."}

Solutions such as pre-training and domain-specific fine-tuning add substantial computational overhead, requiring further domain expertise. Here, we introduce a token-optimized and robust Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) framework by leveraging a massive biomedical KG (SPOKE) with LLMs such as Llama-2-13b, GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4, to generate meaningful biomedical text rooted in established knowledge. Compared to the existing RAG technique for Knowledge Graphs, the proposed method utilizes minimal graph schema for context extraction and uses embedding methods for context pruning. This optimization in context extraction results in more than 50% reduction in token consumption without compromising the accuracy, making a cost-effective and robust RAG implementation on proprietary LLMs. KG-RAG consistently enhanced the performance of LLMs across diverse biomedical prompts by generating responses rooted in established knowledge, accompanied by accurate provenance and statistical evidence (if available) to substantiate the claims. Further benchmarking on human curated datasets, such as biomedical true/false and multiple-choice questions (MCQ), showed a remarkable 71% boost in the performance of the Llama-2 model on the challenging MCQ dataset, demonstrating the framework's capacity to empower open-source models with fewer parameters for domain specific questions. Furthermore, KG-RAG enhanced the performance of proprietary GPT models, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.

One popular paradigm is to employ overlapping user representations to establish domain connections, thereby improving recommendation performance in all scenarios. Nevertheless, the general practice of this approach is to train user embeddings in each domain separately and then aggregate them in a plain manner, often ignoring potential cross-domain similarities between users and items. Furthermore, considering that their training objective is recommendation task-oriented without specific regularizations, the optimized embeddings disregard the interest alignment among user's views, and even violate the user's original interest distribution. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cross-domain recommendation framework, namely COAST, to improve recommendation performance on dual domains by perceiving the cross-domain similarity between entities and aligning user interests. Specifically, we first construct a unified cross-domain heterogeneous graph and redefine the message passing mechanism of graph convolutional networks to capture high-order similarity of users and items across domains. Targeted at user interest alignment, we develop deep insights from two more fine-grained perspectives of user-user and user-item interest invariance across domains by virtue of affluent unsupervised and semantic signals. We conduct intensive experiments on multiple tasks, constructed from two large recommendation data sets. Extensive results show COAST consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art cross-domain recommendation algorithms as well as classic single-domain recommendation methods."}

Neural graph databases (NGDBs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm that combines the strengths of graph databases (GDBs) and neural networks to enable efficient storage, retrieval, and analysis of graph-structured data which can be adaptively trained with LLMs. The usage of neural embedding storage and Complex neural logical Query Answering (CQA) provides NGDBs with generalization ability. When the graph is incomplete, by extracting latent patterns and representations, neural graph databases can fill gaps in the graph structure, revealing hidden relationships and enabling accurate query answering. Nevertheless, this capability comes with inherent trade-offs, as it introduces additional privacy risks to the domain-specific or private databases. Malicious attackers can infer more sensitive information in the database using well-designed queries such as from the answer sets of where Turing Award winners born before 1950 and after 1940 lived, the living places of Turing Award winner Hinton are probably exposed, although the living places may have been deleted in the training stage due to the privacy concerns. In this work, we propose a privacy-preserved neural graph database (P-NGDB) framework to alleviate the risks of privacy leakage in NGDBs. We introduce adversarial training techniques in the training stage to enforce the NGDBs to generate indistinguishable answers when queried with private information, enhancing the difficulty of inferring sensitive information through combinations of multiple innocuous queries."}

To explore better generalization from GCL to downstream tasks, previous methods heuristically define data augmentation or pretext tasks. However, the generalization ability of GCL and its theoretical principle are still less reported. In this paper, we first propose a metric named GCL-GE for GCL generalization ability. Considering the intractability of the metric due to the agnostic downstream task, we theoretically prove a mutual information upper bound for it from an information-theoretic perspective. Guided by the bound, we design a GCL framework named InfoAdv with enhanced generalization ability, which jointly optimizes the generalization metric and InfoMax to strike the right balance between pretext task fitting and the generalization ability on downstream tasks.

Unfortunately, it is difficult to preserve semantics well during augmentations in view of the diverse nature of graph data. Currently, data augmentations in GCL that are designed to preserve semantics broadly fall into three unsatisfactory ways. First, the augmentations can be manually picked per dataset by trial-and-errors. Second, the augmentations can be selected via cumbersome search. Third, the augmentations can be obtained by introducing expensive domain-specific knowledge as guidance. All of these limit the efficiency and more general applicability of existing GCL methods.

SimGRACE is inspired by the observation that graph data can preserve their semantics well during encoder perturbations while not requiring manual trial-and-errors, cumbersome search or expensive domain knowledge for augmentations selection. Also, we explain why SimGRACE can succeed. Furthermore, we devise adversarial training scheme, dubbed \\textbf{AT-SimGRACE}, to enhance the robustness of graph contrastive learning and theoretically explain the reasons.

The key idea is to maximize the agreement between two augmented views of each graph via data augmentation. Existing GCL models mainly focus on applying \\textit{identical augmentation strategies} for all graphs within a given scenario. However, real-world graphs are often not monomorphic but abstractions of diverse natures. Even within the same scenario (e.g., macromolecules and online communities), different graphs might need diverse augmentations to perform effective GCL. Thus, blindly augmenting all graphs without considering their individual characteristics may undermine the performance of GCL arts.To deal with this, we propose the first principled framework, termed as \\textit{G}raph contrastive learning with \\textit{P}ersonalized \\textit{A}ugmentation (GPA), to advance conventional GCL by allowing each graph to choose its own suitable augmentation operations.In essence, GPA infers tailored augmentation strategies for each graph based on its topology and node attributes via a learnable augmentation selector, which is a plug-and-play module and can be effectively trained with downstream GCL models end-to-end. Extensive experiments across 11 benchmark graphs from different types and domains demonstrate the superiority of GPA against state-of-the-art competitors.Moreover, by visualizing the learned augmentation distributions across different types of datasets, we show that GPA can effectively identify the most suitable augmentations for each graph based on its characteristics."}

How to effectively leverage the rich structural information in complex graphs, such as knowledge graphs with heterogeneous types of entities and relations, is a primary open challenge in the field. Most GCN methods are either restricted to graphs with a homogeneous type of edges (e.g., citation links only), or focusing on representation learning for nodes only instead of jointly propagating and updating the embeddings of both nodes and edges for target-driven objectives. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a novel framework, namely the Knowledge Embedding based Graph Convolutional Network (KE-GCN), which combines the power of GCNs in graph-based belief propagation and the strengths of advanced knowledge embedding (a.k.a. knowledge graph embedding) methods, and goes beyond. Our theoretical analysis shows that KE-GCN offers an elegant unification of several well-known GCN methods as specific cases, with a new perspective of graph convolution.

Owing to its extreme versatility and variation in spatial and temporal correlations, TKG reasoning presents a challenging task, demanding efficient capture of concurrent structures and evolutional interactions among facts. While existing methods have made strides in this direction, they still fall short of harnessing the diverse forms of intrinsic expressive semantics of TKGs, which encompass entity correlations across multiple timestamps and periodicity of temporal information. This limitation constrains their ability to thoroughly reflect historical dependencies and future trends. In response to these drawbacks, this paper proposes an innovative reasoning approach that focuses on Learning Multi-graph Structure (LMS). Concretely, it comprises three distinct modules concentrating on multiple aspects of graph structure knowledge within TKGs, including concurrent and evolutional patterns along timestamps, query-specific correlations across timestamps, and semantic dependencies of timestamps, which capture TKG features from various perspectives. Besides, LMS incorporates an adaptive gate for merging entity representations both along and across timestamps effectively. Moreover, it integrates timestamp semantics into graph attention calculations and time-aware decoders, in order to impose temporal constraints on events and narrow down prediction scopes with historical statistics. Extensive experimental results on five event-based benchmark datasets demonstrate that LMS outperforms state-of-the-art extrapolation models, indicating the superiority of modeling a multi-graph perspective for TKG reasoning."}

Questions are often numerous in online education systems, and are always associated with much fewer skills. However, the previous literature fails to involve question information together with high-order question-skill correlations, which is mostly limited by data sparsity and multi-skill problems. From the model perspective, previous models can hardly capture the long-term dependency of student exercise history, and cannot model the interactions between student-questions, and student-skills in a consistent way. In this paper, we propose a Graph-based Interaction model for Knowledge Tracing (GIKT) to tackle the above probems. More specifically, GIKT utilizes graph convolutional network (GCN) to substantially incorporate question-skill correlations via embedding propagation. Besides, considering that relevant questions are usually scattered throughout the exercise history, and that question and skill are just different instantiations of knowledge, GIKT generalizes the degree of students' master of the question to the interactions between the student's current state, the student's history related exercises, the target question, and related skills. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that GIKT achieves the new state-of-the-art performance, with at least 1% absolute AUC improvement."}

The benefit of knowledge tracing is that students' learning plans can be better organised and adjusted, and interventions can be made when necessary. With the recent rise of deep learning, Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) has utilised Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to accomplish this task with some success. Other works have attempted to introduce Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and redefine the task accordingly to achieve significant improvements. However, these efforts suffer from at least one of the following drawbacks: 1) they pay too much attention to details of the nodes rather than to high-level semantic information; 2) they struggle to effectively establish spatial associations and complex structures of the nodes; and 3) they represent either concepts or exercises only, without integrating them. Inspired by recent advances in self-supervised learning, we propose a Bi-Graph Contrastive Learning based Knowledge Tracing (Bi-CLKT) to address these limitations. Specifically, we design a two-layer contrastive learning scheme based on an \"exercise-to-exercise\" (E2E) relational subgraph. It involves node-level contrastive learning of subgraphs to obtain discriminative representations of exercises, and graph-level contrastive learning to obtain discriminative representations of concepts. Moreover, we designed a joint contrastive loss to obtain better representations and hence better prediction performance. Also, we explored two different variants, using RNN and memory-augmented neural networks as the prediction layer for comparison to obtain better representations of exercises and concepts respectively. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that the proposed Bi-CLKT and its variants outperform other baseline models."}

Prior graph neural network models primarily focused on extracting task-specific structural features through supervised learning objectives, but they fell short in capturing the inherent semantic and structural features of the entire graph.

The SSA-GCN's key contributions lie in three aspects: firstly, it derives semantic information through unsupervised feature extraction from a knowledge graph perspective; secondly, it obtains structural information through unsupervised feature extraction from a complex network perspective; and finally, it integrates these features through a cross-attention mechanism. By leveraging these features, we augment the graph convolutional network, thereby enhancing the model's generalization capabilities.

Recent approaches mainly focus on re-balancing different classes during model training, which fails to explicitly introduce new knowledge and sacrifices the performance of the head classes. To address these drawbacks, we propose a novel framework called Retrieval Augmented Hybrid Network (RAHNet) to jointly learn a robust feature extractor and an unbiased classifier in a decoupled manner. In the feature extractor training stage, we develop a graph retrieval module to search for relevant graphs that directly enrich the intra-class diversity for the tail classes.

Representation learning on heterogeneous graphs aims to obtain low-dimensional node representations that could preserve both node attributes and relation information. However, most of the existing graph convolution approaches were designed for homogeneous graphs, and therefore cannot handle heterogeneous graphs. Some recent methods designed for heterogeneous graphs are also faced with several issues, including the insufficient utilization of heterogeneous properties, structural information loss, and lack of interpretability. In this paper, we propose HGConv, a novel Heterogeneous Graph Convolution approach, to learn comprehensive node representations on heterogeneous graphs with a hybrid micro/macro level convolutional operation. Different from existing methods, HGConv could perform convolutions on the intrinsic structure of heterogeneous graphs directly at both micro and macro levels: A micro-level convolution to learn the importance of nodes within the same relation, and a macro-level convolution to distinguish the subtle difference across different relations. The hybrid strategy enables HGConv to fully leverage heterogeneous information with proper interpretability. Moreover, a weighted residual connection is designed to aggregate both inherent attributes and neighbor information of the focal node adaptively. Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate not only the superiority of HGConv over existing methods, but also the intuitive interpretability of our approach for graph analysis."}

Various methodologies have indicated that enhancing the size of the model or the volume of training data enhances its capacity to retrieve symbolic knowledge, often with minimal or no human supervision. Despite these advancements, there is a void in comprehensively evaluating whether LMs can encompass the intricate topological and semantic attributes of KGs, attributes crucial for reasoning processes. In this work, we provide an exhaustive evaluation of language models of varying sizes and capabilities. We construct nine qualitative benchmarks that encompass a spectrum of attributes including symmetry, asymmetry, hierarchy, bidirectionality, compositionality, paths, entity-centricity, bias and ambiguity. Additionally, we propose novel evaluation metrics tailored for each of these attributes. Our extensive evaluation of various LMs shows that while these models exhibit considerable potential in recalling factual information, their ability to capture intricate topological and semantic traits of KGs remains significantly constrained. We note that our proposed evaluation metrics are more reliable in evaluating these abilities than the existing metrics. Lastly, some of our benchmarks challenge the common notion that larger LMs (e.g., GPT-4) universally outshine their smaller counterparts (e.g., BERT)."}

Since knowledge graphs can be viewed as the discrete symbolic representations of knowledge, reasoning on knowledge graphs can naturally leverage the symbolic techniques. However, symbolic reasoning is intolerant of the ambiguous and noisy data. On the contrary, the recent advances of deep learning promote neural reasoning on knowledge graphs, which is robust to the ambiguous and noisy data, but lacks interpretability compared to symbolic reasoning. Considering the advantages and disadvantages of both methodologies, recent efforts have been made on combining the two reasoning methods. In this survey, we take a thorough look at the development of the symbolic, neural and hybrid reasoning on knowledge graphs. We survey two specific reasoning tasks, knowledge graph completion and question answering on knowledge graphs, and explain them in a unified reasoning framework. We also briefly discuss the future directions for knowledge graph reasoning."}

To address this issue, we build the new paradigm of KGE in the context of causality and embedding disentanglement. We further propose a Causality-enhanced knowledge graph Embedding (CausE) framework. CausE employs causal intervention to estimate the causal effect of the confounder embeddings and design new training objectives to make stable predictions.

Recently, promising results have been achieved by leveraging cross-modal information in KGs, using ensembles that combine knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs) and contextual language models (LMs). However, existing ensembles are either (1) not consistently effective in terms of ranking accuracy gains or (2) impractically inefficient on larger datasets due to the combinatorial explosion problem of pairwise ranking with deep language models. In this paper, we propose a novel tiered ranking architecture CascadER to maintain the ranking accuracy of full ensembling while improving efficiency considerably. CascadER uses LMs to rerank the outputs of more efficient base KGEs, relying on an adaptive subset selection scheme aimed at invoking the LMs minimally while maximizing accuracy gain over the KGE. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CascadER improves MRR by up to 9 points over KGE baselines, setting new state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks while improving efficiency by one or more orders of magnitude over competitive cross-modal baselines. Our empirical analyses reveal that diversity of models across modalities and preservation of individual models' confidence signals help explain the effectiveness of CascadER, and suggest promising directions for cross-modal cascaded architectures.

However, their incompleteness may limit their potential. Thus, continuous curation is needed to mitigate this problem. One of the strategies to address this problem is KG alignment, i.e., forming a more complete KG by merging two or more KGs. This paper proposes i-Align, an interpretable KG alignment model. Unlike the existing KG alignment models, i-Align provides an explanation for each alignment prediction while maintaining high alignment performance. Experts can use the explanation to check the correctness of the alignment prediction. Thus, the high quality of a KG can be maintained during the curation process (e.g., the merging process of two KGs). To this end, a novel Transformer-based Graph Encoder (Trans-GE) is proposed as a key component of i-Align for aggregating information from entities' neighbors (structures). Trans-GE uses Edge-gated Attention that combines the adjacency matrix and the self-attention matrix to learn a gating mechanism to control the information aggregation from the neighboring entities. It also uses historical embeddings, allowing Trans-GE to be trained over mini-batches, or smaller sub-graphs, to address the scalability issue when encoding a large KG. Another component of i-Align is a Transformer encoder for aggregating entities' attributes. This way, i-Align can generate explanations in the form of a set of the most influential attributes/neighbors based on attention weights. Extensive experiments are conducted to show the power of i-Align. The experiments include several aspects, such as the model's effectiveness for aligning KGs, the quality of the generated explanations, and its practicality for aligning large KGs. The results show the effectiveness of i-Align in these aspects."}

To address this, we exploit to train a more effective cross-modal pertaining model which is adaptively capable of incorporating key concept information from the multi-modal data, by using an entity graph whose node and edge respectively denote the entity and the similarity relation between entities. Specifically, a novel Entity-Graph Enhanced Cross-Modal Pretraining (EGE-CMP) model is proposed for instance-level commodity retrieval, that explicitly injects entity knowledge in both node-based and subgraph-based ways into the multi-modal networks via a self-supervised hybrid-stream transformer, which could reduce the confusion between different object contents, thereby effectively guiding the network to focus on entities with real semantic.

In this work, we extend traditional statistical relational learning approaches (e.g., link prediction in collaboration networks) and formulate a problem of anticipating technical expertise and capability evolution using dynamic heterogeneous graph representations. We develop novel capabilities to forecast collaboration patterns, authorship behavior, and technical capability evolution at different granularities (e.g., scientist and institution levels) in two distinct research fields. We implement a dynamic graph transformer (DGT) neural architecture, which pushes the state-of-the-art graph neural network models by (a) forecasting heterogeneous (rather than homogeneous) nodes and edges, and (b) relying on both discrete -- and continuous -- time inputs. We demonstrate that our DGT models predict collaboration, partnership, and expertise patterns with 0.26, 0.73, and 0.53 mean reciprocal rank values for AI and 0.48, 0.93, and 0.22 for NN domains. DGT model performance exceeds the best-performing static graph baseline models by 30-80% across AI and NN domains. Our findings demonstrate that DGT models boost inductive task performance, when previously unseen nodes appear in the test data, for the domains with emerging collaboration patterns (e.g., AI). Specifically, models accurately predict which established scientists will collaborate with early career scientists and vice-versa in the AI domain."}

In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive investigation of existing LLM studies on graph data, which summarizes the relevant graph analytics tasks solved by advanced LLM models and points out the existing challenges and future directions. Specifically, we study the key problems of LLM-based generative graph analytics (LLM-GGA) in terms of three categories: LLM-based graph query processing (LLM-GQP), LLM-based graph inference and learning (LLM-GIL), and graph-LLM-based applications. LLM-GQP focuses on an integration of graph analytics techniques and LLM prompts, including graph understanding and knowledge graphs and LLMs, while LLM-GIL focuses on learning and reasoning over graphs, including graph learning, graph-formed reasoning, and graph representation. We summarize the useful prompts incorporated into LLM to handle different graph downstream tasks.

In this paper, we construct a large-scale HG benchmark dataset named UniKG from Wikidata to facilitate knowledge mining and heterogeneous graph representation learning. Overall, UniKG contains more than 77 million multi-attribute entities and 2000 diverse association types, which significantly surpasses the scale of existing HG datasets. To perform effective learning on the large-scale UniKG, two key measures are taken, including (i) the semantic alignment strategy for multi-attribute entities, which projects the feature description of multi-attribute nodes into a common embedding space to facilitate node aggregation in a large receptive field; (ii) proposing a novel plug-and-play anisotropy propagation module (APM) to learn effective multi-hop anisotropy propagation kernels, which extends methods of large-scale homogeneous graphs to heterogeneous graphs. These two strategies enable efficient information propagation among a tremendous number of multi-attribute entities and meantimes adaptively mine multi-attribute association through the multi-hop aggregation in large-scale HGs.

However, incorporating additional modules: 1) would need retraining additional modules when encountering novel domains; 2) would become a bottleneck since LLMs' strong abilities are not fully utilized for retrieval. In this paper, we propose a paradigm, termed Knowledge Solver (KSL), to teach LLMs to search for essential knowledge from external knowledge bases by harnessing their own strong generalizability. Specifically, we design a simple yet effective prompt to transform retrieval into a multi-hop decision sequence, which empowers LLMs with searching knowledge ability in zero-shot manner. Additionally, KSL is able to provide complete retrieval paths and therefore increase explainability of LLMs' reasoning processes. We conduct experiments on three datasets: CommonsenseQA, OpenbookQA, and MedQA-USMLE, and found that our approach improves LLM baseline performance by a relatively large margin."}

However, graphs in reality are often structurally imbalanced, that is, only a few hub nodes have a denser local structure and higher influence. The imbalance may compromise the robustness of existing GML models, especially in learning tail nodes. This paper proposes a selective graph augmentation method (SAug) to solve this problem. Firstly, a Pagerank-based sampling strategy is designed to identify hub nodes and tail nodes in the graph. Secondly, a selective augmentation strategy is proposed, which drops the noisy neighbors of hub nodes on one side, and discovers the latent neighbors and generates pseudo neighbors for tail nodes on the other side. It can also alleviate the structural imbalance between two types of nodes. Finally, a GNN model will be retrained on the augmented graph.

The graph has an inherently scale-free nature, is highly connected, and can be used for graph reasoning by taking advantage of transitive and isomorphic properties that reveal unprecedented interdisciplinary relationships that can be used to answer queries, identify gaps in knowledge, propose never-before-seen material designs, and predict material behaviors. We compute deep node embeddings for combinatorial node similarity ranking for use in a path sampling strategy links dissimilar concepts that have previously not been related. One comparison revealed structural parallels between biological materials and Beethoven's 9th Symphony, highlighting shared patterns of complexity through isomorphic mapping. In another example, the algorithm proposed a hierarchical mycelium-based composite based on integrating path sampling with principles extracted from Kandinsky's 'Composition VII' painting. The resulting material integrates an innovative set of concepts that include a balance of chaos/order, adjustable porosity, mechanical strength, and complex patterned chemical functionalization. We uncover other isomorphisms across science, technology and art, revealing a nuanced ontology of immanence that reveal a context-dependent heterarchical interplay of constituents. Graph-based generative AI achieves a far higher degree of novelty, explorative capacity, and technical detail, than conventional approaches and establishes a widely useful framework for innovation by revealing hidden connections."}

A wide number of knowledgedriven domains like science are daily fueled by unlimited flows of textual contents. In order to navigate across these growing constellations of words, interdisciplinary innovations are emerging at the crossroad between social and computational sciences. In particular, complex systems approaches make it now possible to reconstruct multi-level and multi-scale structures of knowledge by means of phylomemies: inheritance networks of elements of knowledge. In this article, we will introduce an endogenous way to visualize the outcomes of the phylomemy reconstruction process by combining both synchronic and diachronic approaches. Our aim is to translate high-dimensional phylomemetic networks into graphical projections and interactive visualizations. To that end, we will use seabed and kinship views to translate the multilevel and multi-scale properties of complex branches of knowledge. We will then define a generic macro-to-micro methodology of exploration implemented within an open source software called Memiescape and validate our approach by browsing through the reconstructed histories of thousands of scientific publications and clinical trials."}

As for alleviating the sparsity and cold start problems encountered by recommender systems, researchers resort to employing side information or knowledge in recommendation as a strategy for uncovering hidden (indirect) user-item relations, aiming to enrich observed information (or data) for recommendation. However, in the face of the high complexity and large scale of side information and knowledge, this strategy relies for efficient implementation on the scalability of recommendation models. Not until after the prevalence of machine learning did graph embedding techniques be a concentration, which can efficiently utilize complex and large-scale data. In light of that, equipping recommender systems with graph embedding techniques has been widely studied these years, appearing to outperform conventional recommendation implemented directly based on graph topological analysis. As the focus, this article retrospects graph embedding-based recommendation from embedding techniques for bipartite graphs, general graphs and knowledge graphs, and proposes a general design pipeline of that. In addition, after comparing several representative graph embedding-based recommendation models with the most common-used conventional recommendation models on simulations, this article manifests that the conventional models can overall outperform the graph embedding-based ones in predicting implicit user-item interactions, revealing the comparative weakness of graph embedding-based recommendation in these tasks. To foster future research, this article proposes suggestions on making a trade-off between graph embedding-based recommendation and conventional recommendation in different tasks, and puts forward open questions."}

Unfortunately, users' uncontrollable search customs usually bring vast amounts of long-tail queries, which severely threaten the capability of search models. Inspired by recently emerging graph neural networks (GNNs) and contrastive learning (CL), several efforts have been made in alleviating the long-tail issue and achieve considerable performance. Nevertheless, they still face a few major weaknesses. Most importantly, they do not explicitly utilize the contextual structure between heads and tails for effective knowledge transfer, and intention-level information is commonly ignored for more generalized representations. To this end, we develop a novel framework GARCIA, which exploits the graph based knowledge transfer and intention based representation generalization in a contrastive setting. In particular, we employ an adaptive encoder to produce informative representations for queries and services, as well as hierarchical structure aware representations of intentions. To fully understand tail queries and services, we equip GARCIA with a novel multi-granularity contrastive learning module, which powers representations through knowledge transfer, structure enhancement and intention generalization. Subsequently, the complete GARCIA is well trained in a pre-training&fine-tuning manner. At last, we conduct extensive experiments on both offline and online environments, which demonstrates the superior capability of GARCIA in improving tail queries and overall performance in service search scenarios."}

In recent years, various types of side information have been explored to alleviate this problem. Among them, knowledge graph (KG) has attracted extensive research interests as it can encode users/items and their associated attributes in the graph structure to preserve the relation information. In contrast, less attention has been paid to the item-item co-occurrence information (i.e., \\textit{co-view}), which contains rich item-item similarity information. It provides information from a perspective different from the user/item-attribute graph and is also valuable for the CF recommendation models. In this work, we make an effort to study the potential of integrating both types of side information (i.e., KG and item-item co-occurrence data) for recommendation. To achieve the goal, we propose a unified graph-based recommendation model (UGRec), which integrates the traditional directed relations in KG and the undirected item-item co-occurrence relations simultaneously. In particular, for a directed relation, we transform the head and tail entities into the corresponding relation space to model their relation; and for an undirected co-occurrence relation, we project head and tail entities into a unique hyperplane in the entity space to minimize their distance. In addition, a head-tail relation-aware attentive mechanism is designed for fine-grained relation modeling. Extensive experiments have been conducted on several publicly accessible datasets to evaluate the proposed model. Results show that our model outperforms several previous state-of-the-art methods and demonstrate the effectiveness of our UGRec model."}
{"id": "87", "arxiv": "2102.03787v1", "title": "Improving Accuracy and Diversity in Matching of Recommendation with Diversified Preference Network", "abstract": "Recently, real-world recommendation systems need to deal with millions of candidates. It is extremely challenging to conduct sophisticated end-to-end algorithms on the entire corpus due to the tremendous computation costs. Therefore, conventional recommendation systems usually contain two modules. The matching module focuses on the coverage, which aims to efficiently retrieve hundreds of items from large corpora, while the ranking module generates specific ranks for these items. Recommendation diversity is an essential factor that impacts user experience. Most efforts have explored recommendation diversity in ranking, while the matching module should take more responsibility for diversity. In this paper, we propose a novel Heterogeneous graph neural network framework for diversified recommendation (GraphDR) in matching to improve both recommendation accuracy and diversity. Specifically, GraphDR builds a huge heterogeneous preference network to record different types of user preferences, and conduct a field-level heterogeneous graph attention network for node aggregation. We also innovatively conduct a neighbor-similarity based loss to balance both recommendation accuracy and diversity for the diversified matching task. In experiments, we conduct extensive online and offline evaluations on a real-world recommendation system with various accuracy and diversity metrics and achieve significant improvements. We also conduct model analyses and case study for a better understanding of our model. Moreover, GraphDR has been deployed on a well-known recommendation system, which affects millions of users. The source code will be released."}

The notion of a neighbor is often based on binary considerations, such as the k nearest neighbors. However, considering that data is often organized as a manifold with low intrinsic dimension, the notion of a neighbor must recognize higher-order relationship, to capture neighbors in all directions. Proximity graphs, such as the Relative Neighbor Graphs (RNG), use trinary relationships which capture the notion of direction and have been successfully used in a number of applications. However, the current algorithms for computing the RNG, despite widespread use, are approximate and not scalable. This paper proposes a novel type of graph, the Generalized Relative Neighborhood Graph (GRNG) for use in a pivot layer that then guides the efficient and exact construction of the RNG of a set of exemplars. It also shows how to extend this to a multi-layer hierarchy which significantly improves over the state-of-the-art methods which can only construct an approximate RNG."}

In this context, automatic temporal knowledge graph completion (TKGC) has gained great interest. Recent TKGC methods integrate advanced deep learning techniques, e.g., Transformers, and achieve superior model performance. However, this also introduces a large number of excessive parameters, which brings a heavier burden for parameter optimization. In this paper, we propose a simple but powerful graph encoder for TKGC, called TARGCN. TARGCN is parameter-efficient, and it extensively explores every entity's temporal context for learning contextualized representations. We find that instead of adopting various kinds of complex modules, it is more beneficial to efficiently capture the temporal contexts of entities. We experiment TARGCN on three benchmark datasets. Our model can achieve a more than 46% relative improvement on the GDELT dataset compared with state-of-the-art TKGC models. Meanwhile, it outperforms the strongest baseline on the ICEWS05-15 dataset with around 18% fewer parameters."}

A core contribution of gMark is its ability to target and control the diversity of properties of both the generated instances and the generated workloads coupled to these instances. Further novelties include support for regular path queries, a fundamental graph query paradigm, and schema-driven selectivity estimation of queries, a key feature in controlling workload chokepoints. We illustrate the flexibility and practical usability of gMark by showcasing the framework's capabilities in generating high quality graphs and workloads, and its ability to encode user-defined schemas across a variety of application domains."}

To show this, we first introduce the application of graph search in various scenarios. We then formalize the graph search problem, and give an analysis of graph search from an evolutionary point of view, followed by the evidences from both the industry and academia. After that, we analyze the difficulties and challenges of big graph search. Finally, we present three classes of techniques towards big graph search: query techniques, data techniques and distributed computing techniques."}

Numerous graphs such as web or social networks may contain up to trillions of edges. Often, these graphs are also dynamic (their structure changes over time) and have domain-specific rich data associated with vertices and edges. Graph database systems such as Neo4j enable storing, processing, and analyzing such large, evolving, and rich datasets. Due to the sheer size of such datasets, combined with the irregular nature of graph processing, these systems face unique design challenges. To facilitate the understanding of this emerging domain, we present the first survey and taxonomy of graph database systems. We focus on identifying and analyzing fundamental categories of these systems (e.g., triple stores, tuple stores, native graph database systems, or object-oriented systems), the associated graph models (e.g., RDF or Labeled Property Graph), data organization techniques (e.g., storing graph data in indexing structures or dividing data into records), and different aspects of data distribution and query execution (e.g., support for sharding and ACID). 51 graph database systems are presented and compared, including Neo4j, OrientDB, or Virtuoso. We outline graph database queries and relationships with associated domains (NoSQL stores, graph streaming, and dynamic graph algorithms).

Despite much progress, there is still a lack of understanding (especially at scale) of the nature of commonsense knowledge itself. A potential source of structured commonsense knowledge that could be used to derive insights is ConceptNet. In particular, ConceptNet contains several coarse-grained relations, including HasContext, FormOf and SymbolOf, which can prove invaluable in understanding broad, but critically important, commonsense notions such as 'context'. In this article, we present a methodology based on unsupervised knowledge graph representation learning and clustering to reveal and study substructures in three heavily used commonsense relations in ConceptNet. Our results show that, despite having an 'official' definition in ConceptNet, many of these commonsense relations exhibit considerable sub-structure. In the future, therefore, such relations could be sub-divided into other relations with more refined definitions. We also supplement our core study with visualizations and qualitative analyses."}

With optimizations inherent as part of their design, these systems are complex, and have unique features beyond conventional graph processing. This paper describes CG Calculus, the first semantic foundation for continuous graph processing. The calculus captures the essential behavior of both the backend graph processing engine and the frontend application, with a focus on two essential features: temporal locality optimization (TLO) and incremental operation processing (IOP). A key design insight is that the operations continuously applied to the graph can be captured by a semantics defined over the operation stream flowing through the graph nodes. CG Calculus is a systematic study on the correctness of building continuous graph processing systems and applications. The most important result is result determinism: despite significant non-deterministic executions introduced by TLO and IOP, the results produced by CG Calculus are the same as conventional graph processing without TLO or IOP. The metatheory of CG Calculus is mechanized in Coq."}

In particular, CORE aims to recover missing edges in graphs while simultaneously removing noise from the graph structures, thereby enhancing the model's robustness and performance. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the applicability and superiority of CORE over state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its potential as a leading approach for robust LP in graph representation learning."}

This has led to the development of a number of knowledge integration (KI) methods which aim to incorporate external knowledge into pretrained LMs. Even though KI methods show some performance gains over vanilla LMs, the inner-workings of these methods are not well-understood. For instance, it is unclear how and what kind of knowledge is effectively integrated into these models and if such integration may lead to catastrophic forgetting of already learned knowledge. This paper revisits the KI process in these models with an information-theoretic view and shows that KI can be interpreted using a graph convolution operation. We propose a probe model called \\textit{Graph Convolution Simulator} (GCS) for interpreting knowledge-enhanced LMs and exposing what kind of knowledge is integrated into these models. We conduct experiments to verify that our GCS can indeed be used to correctly interpret the KI process, and we use it to analyze two well-known knowledge-enhanced LMs: ERNIE and K-Adapter, and find that only a small amount of factual knowledge is integrated in them. We stratify knowledge in terms of various relation types and find that ERNIE and K-Adapter integrate different kinds of knowledge to different extent. Our analysis also shows that simply increasing the size of the KI corpus may not lead to better KI; fundamental advances may be needed."}

Recently, graph neural networks (GNN) were shown to be successful in effectively representing graph structured data because of their good performance and generalization ability. GNN is a deep learning based method that learns a node representation by combining specific nodes and the structural/topological information of a graph. However, like other deep models, explaining the effectiveness of GNN models is a challenging task because of the complex nonlinear transformations made over the iterations. In this paper, we propose GraphLIME, a local interpretable model explanation for graphs using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) Lasso, which is a nonlinear feature selection method. GraphLIME is a generic GNN-model explanation framework that learns a nonlinear interpretable model locally in the subgraph of the node being explained. More specifically, to explain a node, we generate a nonlinear interpretable model from its $N$-hop neighborhood and then compute the K most representative features as the explanations of its prediction using HSIC Lasso. Through experiments on two real-world datasets, the explanations of GraphLIME are found to be of extraordinary degree and more descriptive in comparison to the existing explanation methods."}
