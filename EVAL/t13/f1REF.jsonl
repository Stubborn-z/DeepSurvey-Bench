IMP makes use of a novel design that combines Alternating Gradient Descent (AGD) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) for efficient model and task scaling. We conduct extensive empirical studies and reveal the following key insights: 1) Performing gradient descent updates by alternating on diverse modalities, loss functions, and tasks, with varying input resolutions, efficiently improves the model. 2) Sparsification with MoE on a single modality-agnostic encoder substantially improves the performance, outperforming dense models that use modality-specific encoders or additional fusion layers and greatly mitigates the conflicts between modalities. IMP achieves competitive performance on a wide range of downstream tasks including video classification, image classification, image-text, and video-text retrieval.

The scalability and availability of high-quality training data play a pivotal role in the success of LMMs. In the realm of food, while comprehensive food datasets such as Recipe1M offer an abundance of ingredient and recipe information, they often fall short of providing ample data for nutritional analysis. The Recipe1M+ dataset, despite offering a subset for nutritional evaluation, is limited in the scale and accuracy of nutrition information. To bridge this gap, we introduce Uni-Food, a unified food dataset that comprises over 100,000 images with various food labels, including categories, ingredients, recipes, and ingredient-level nutritional information. Uni-Food is designed to provide a more holistic approach to food data analysis, thereby enhancing the performance and capabilities of LMMs in this domain. To mitigate the conflicts arising from multi-task supervision during fine-tuning of LMMs, we introduce a novel Linear Rectification Mixture of Diverse Experts (RoDE) approach. RoDE utilizes a diverse array of experts to address tasks of varying complexity, thereby facilitating the coordination of trainable parameters, i.e., it allocates more parameters for more complex tasks and, conversely, fewer parameters for simpler tasks. RoDE implements linear rectification union to refine the router's functionality, thereby enhancing the efficiency of sparse task allocation. These design choices endow RoDE with features that ensure GPU memory efficiency and ease of optimization.

In this this work, we extend the Mixture of Experts to a stacked model, the Deep Mixture of Experts, with multiple sets of gating and experts. This exponentially increases the number of effective experts by associating each input with a combination of experts at each layer, yet maintains a modest model size. On a randomly translated version of the MNIST dataset, we find that the Deep Mixture of Experts automatically learns to develop location-dependent (\"where\") experts at the first layer, and class-specific (\"what\") experts at the second layer. In addition, we see that the different combinations are in use when the model is applied to a dataset of speech monophones. These demonstrate effective use of all expert combinations."}

However, a poor expert routing strategy (e.g. one resulting in load imbalance) can cause certain experts to be under-trained, leading to an expert being under or over-specialized. Prior work allocates a fixed number of experts to each token using a top-k function regardless of the relative importance of different tokens. To address this, we propose a heterogeneous mixture-of-experts employing an expert choice method. Instead of letting tokens select the top-k experts, we have experts selecting the top-k tokens. As a result, each token can be routed to a variable number of experts and each expert can have a fixed bucket size. We systematically study pre-training speedups using the same computational resources of the Switch Transformer top-1 and GShard top-2 gating of prior work and find that our method improves training convergence time by more than 2x.

Indeed, the cosine router demonstrates favorable performance in image and language tasks and exhibits better ability to mitigate the representation collapse issue, which often leads to parameter redundancy and limited representation potentials. Despite its empirical success, a comprehensive analysis of the cosine router in MoE has been lacking. Considering the least square estimation of the cosine routing MoE, we demonstrate that due to the intrinsic interaction of the model parameters in the cosine router via some partial differential equations, regardless of the structures of the experts, the estimation rates of experts and model parameters can be as slow as $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\log^τ(n))$ where $τ> 0$ is some constant and $n$ is the sample size. Surprisingly, these pessimistic non-polynomial convergence rates can be circumvented by the widely used technique in practice to stabilize the cosine router -- simply adding noises to the $\\ell^2$-norms in the cosine router, which we refer to as \\textit{perturbed cosine router}. Under the strongly identifiable settings of the expert functions, we prove that the estimation rates for both the experts and model parameters under the perturbed cosine routing MoE are significantly improved to polynomial rates. Finally, we conduct extensive simulation studies in both synthetic and real data settings to empirically validate our theoretical results."}

The algorithmic performance of MoE relies on its token routing mechanism that forwards each input token to the right sub-models or experts. While token routing dynamically determines the amount of expert workload at runtime, existing systems suffer inefficient computation due to their static execution, namely static parallelism and pipelining, which does not adapt to the dynamic workload. We present Flex, a highly scalable stack design and implementation for MoE with dynamically adaptive parallelism and pipelining. Flex designs an identical layout for distributing MoE model parameters and input data, which can be leveraged by all possible parallelism or pipelining methods without any mathematical inequivalence or tensor migration overhead. This enables adaptive parallelism/pipelining optimization at zero cost during runtime. Based on this key design, Flex also implements various MoE acceleration techniques. Aggregating all techniques, Flex finally delivers huge speedup at any scale -- 4.96x and 5.75x speedup of a single MoE layer over 16 and 2,048 A100 GPUs, respectively, over the previous state-of-the-art.

Transiting LLMs from datacenters to edge devices brings benefits like better privacy and availability, but is challenged by their massive parameter size and thus unbearable runtime costs. To this end, we present EdgeMoE, an on-device inference engine for mixture-of-expert (MoE) LLMs -- a popular form of sparse LLM that scales its parameter size with almost constant computing complexity. EdgeMoE achieves both memory- and compute-efficiency by partitioning the model into the storage hierarchy: non-expert weights are held in device memory; while expert weights are held on external storage and fetched to memory only when activated. This design is motivated by a key observation that expert weights are bulky but infrequently used due to sparse activation. To further reduce the expert I/O swapping overhead, EdgeMoE incorporates two novel techniques: (1) expert-wise bitwidth adaptation that reduces the expert sizes with tolerable accuracy loss; (2) expert preloading that predicts the activated experts ahead of time and preloads it with the compute-I/O pipeline.

Nevertheless, existing MoE methods usually enforce a constant top-k routing for all tokens, which is arguably restrictive because various tokens (e.g., \"<EOS>\" vs. \"apple\") may require various numbers of experts for feature abstraction. Lifting such a constraint can help make the most of limited resources and unleash the potential of the model for downstream tasks. In this sense, we introduce AdaMoE to realize token-adaptive routing for MoE, where different tokens are permitted to select a various number of experts. AdaMoE makes minimal modifications to the vanilla MoE with top-k routing -- it simply introduces a fixed number of null experts, which do not consume any FLOPs, to the expert set and increases the value of k. AdaMoE does not force each token to occupy a fixed number of null experts but ensures the average usage of the null experts with a load-balancing loss, leading to an adaptive number of null/true experts used by each token. AdaMoE exhibits a strong resemblance to MoEs with expert choice routing while allowing for trivial auto-regressive modeling. AdaMoE is easy to implement and can be effectively applied to pre-trained (MoE-)LLMs. Extensive studies show that AdaMoE can reduce average expert load (FLOPs) while achieving superior performance. For example, on the ARC-C dataset, applying our method to fine-tuning Mixtral-8x7B can reduce FLOPs by 14.5% while increasing accuracy by 1.69%."}

Routers for sparse MoEs can be further grouped into two variants: Token Choice, which matches experts to each token, and Expert Choice, which matches tokens to each expert. We conduct head-to-head experiments with 6 different routers, including existing routers from prior work and new ones we introduce. We show that (i) many routers originally developed for language modeling can be adapted to perform strongly in vision tasks, (ii) in sparse MoE, Expert Choice routers generally outperform Token Choice routers, and (iii) soft MoEs generally outperform sparse MoEs with a fixed compute budget.

These sub-tokens are then assigned to and processed by a diverse set of experts in parallel, and seamlessly reintegrated into the original token form. The multi-head mechanism enables the model to collectively attend to information from various representation spaces within different experts, while significantly enhances expert activation, thus deepens context understanding and alleviate overfitting. Moreover, our MH-MoE is straightforward to implement and decouples from other SMoE optimization methods, making it easy to integrate with other SMoE models for enhanced performance. Extensive experimental results across three tasks: English-focused language modeling, Multi-lingual language modeling and Masked multi-modality modeling tasks, demonstrate the effectiveness of MH-MoE."}

However, with trillions of parameters, MoE is hard to be deployed on cloud or mobile environment. The inference of MoE requires expert parallelism, which is not hardware-friendly and communication expensive. Especially for resource-limited downstream tasks, such sparse structure has to sacrifice a lot of computing efficiency for limited performance gains. In this work, we observe most experts contribute scarcely little to the MoE fine-tuning and inference. We further propose a general method to progressively drop the non-professional experts for the target downstream task, which preserves the benefits of MoE while reducing the MoE model into one single-expert dense model. Our experiments reveal that the fine-tuned single-expert model could preserve 99.3% benefits from MoE across six different types of tasks while enjoying 2x inference speed with free communication cost."}

Building on this, we establish scaling laws for fine-grained MoE, taking into account the number of training tokens, model size, and granularity. Leveraging these laws, we derive the optimal training configuration for a given computational budget. Our findings not only show that MoE models consistently outperform dense Transformers but also highlight that the efficiency gap between dense and MoE models widens as we scale up the model size and training budget. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the common practice of setting the size of experts in MoE to mirror the feed-forward layer is not optimal at almost any computational budget."}

In contrast, Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (Sparse MoE) selectively engages only a limited number, or even just one expert, significantly reducing computation overhead while empirically preserving, and sometimes even enhancing, performance. Despite its wide-ranging applications and these advantageous characteristics, MoE's theoretical underpinnings have remained elusive. In this paper, we embark on an exploration of Sparse MoE's generalization error concerning various critical factors.

However, deploying GPT MoE models for parallel inference on distributed systems presents significant challenges, primarily due to the extensive Alltoall communication required for expert routing and aggregation. This communication bottleneck exacerbates the already complex computational landscape, hindering the efficient utilization of high-performance computing resources. In this paper, we propose a lightweight optimization technique called ExFlow, to largely accelerate the inference of these MoE models. We take a new perspective on alleviating the communication overhead by exploiting the inter-layer expert affinity. Unlike previous methods, our solution can be directly applied to pre-trained MoE models without any fine-tuning or accuracy degradation. By proposing a context-coherent expert parallelism on distributed systems, our design only uses one Alltoall communication to deliver the same functionality while previous methods all require two Alltoalls. By carefully examining the conditional probability in tokens' routing across multiple layers, we proved that pre-trained GPT MoE models implicitly exhibit a strong inter-layer expert affinity. We then design an efficient integer programming model to capture such features and show that by properly placing the experts on corresponding GPUs, we can reduce up to 67% cross-GPU routing latency. Our solution beats the cutting-edge MoE implementations with experts from 8 to 64, with up to 2.2x improvement in inference throughput. We further provide a detailed study of how the model implicitly acquires this expert affinity at the very early training stage and how this affinity evolves and stabilizes during training."}

We conduct extensive experiments on cross-lingual language model pre-training and fine-tuning on downstream tasks.

The routing fluctuation tends to harm sample efficiency because the same input updates different experts but only one is finally used. In this paper, we propose StableMoE with two training stages to address the routing fluctuation problem. In the first training stage, we learn a balanced and cohesive routing strategy and distill it into a lightweight router decoupled from the backbone model. In the second training stage, we utilize the distilled router to determine the token-to-expert assignment and freeze it for a stable routing strategy. We validate our method on language modeling and multilingual machine translation. The results show that StableMoE outperforms existing MoE methods in terms of both convergence speed and performance."}

We further propose CompeteSMoE, an effective and efficient algorithm to train large language models by deploying a simple router that predicts the competition outcomes. Consequently, CompeteSMoE enjoys strong performance gains from the competition routing policy while having low computation overheads.

Yet, these methods frequently fall short of achieving sufficient overlap, consequently restricting the potential for performance enhancements. In our study, we extend the scope of this challenge by considering overlap at the broader training graph level. During the forward pass, we enable non-MoE computations to overlap with all-to-all through careful partitioning and pipelining. In the backward pass, we achieve overlap with all-to-all by scheduling gradient weight computations. We implement these techniques in Lancet, a system using compiler-based optimization to automatically enhance MoE model training. Our extensive evaluation reveals that Lancet significantly reduces the time devoted to non-overlapping communication, by as much as 77%. Moreover, it achieves a notable end-to-end speedup of up to 1.3 times when compared to the state-of-the-art solutions."}

In this work, we provide a characterization of two MoE workloads, namely Language Modeling (LM) and Machine Translation (MT) and identify their sources of inefficiencies at deployment.

In this work we demonstrate that transformers can instead learn to dynamically allocate FLOPs (or compute) to specific positions in a sequence, optimising the allocation along the sequence for different layers across the model depth. Our method enforces a total compute budget by capping the number of tokens ($k$) that can participate in the self-attention and MLP computations at a given layer. The tokens to be processed are determined by the network using a top-$k$ routing mechanism. Since $k$ is defined a priori, this simple procedure uses a static computation graph with known tensor sizes, unlike other conditional computation techniques. Nevertheless, since the identities of the $k$ tokens are fluid, this method can expend FLOPs non-uniformly across the time and model depth dimensions. Thus, compute expenditure is entirely predictable in sum total, but dynamic and context-sensitive at the token-level. Not only do models trained in this way learn to dynamically allocate compute, they do so efficiently. These models match baseline performance for equivalent FLOPS and wall-clock times to train, but require a fraction of the FLOPs per forward pass, and can be upwards of 50\\% faster to step during post-training sampling."}

Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architectures have emerged as a solution, activating only a subset of parameters per token, thereby achieving faster inference while maintaining performance. However, SMoE models still face limitations in broader deployment due to their large parameter counts and significant GPU memory requirements. In this work, we introduce a gradient-free evolutionary strategy named EEP (Efficient Expert P}runing) to enhance the pruning of experts in SMoE models. EEP relies solely on model inference (i.e., no gradient computation) and achieves greater sparsity while maintaining or even improving performance on downstream tasks. EEP can be used to reduce both the total number of experts (thus saving GPU memory) and the number of active experts (thus accelerating inference). For example, we demonstrate that pruning up to 75% of experts in Mixtral $8\\times7$B-Instruct results in a substantial reduction in parameters with minimal performance loss. Remarkably, we observe improved performance on certain tasks, such as a significant increase in accuracy on the SQuAD dataset (from 53.4% to 75.4%), when pruning half of the experts. With these results, EEP not only lowers the barrier to deploying SMoE models,but also challenges the conventional understanding of model pruning by showing that fewer experts can lead to better task-specific performance without any fine-tuning.

However, directly applying LLMs to solve sophisticated problems in specific domains meets many hurdles, caused by the heterogeneity of domain data, the sophistication of domain knowledge, the uniqueness of domain objectives, and the diversity of the constraints (e.g., various social norms, cultural conformity, religious beliefs, and ethical standards in the domain applications). Domain specification techniques are key to make large language models disruptive in many applications. Specifically, to solve these hurdles, there has been a notable increase in research and practices conducted in recent years on the domain specialization of LLMs. This emerging field of study, with its substantial potential for impact, necessitates a comprehensive and systematic review to better summarize and guide ongoing work in this area. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey on domain specification techniques for large language models, an emerging direction critical for large language model applications. First, we propose a systematic taxonomy that categorizes the LLM domain-specialization techniques based on the accessibility to LLMs and summarizes the framework for all the subcategories as well as their relations and differences to each other. Second, we present an extensive taxonomy of critical application domains that can benefit dramatically from specialized LLMs, discussing their practical significance and open challenges. Last, we offer our insights into the current research status and future trends in this area."}

However, a major challenge lies in the computational cost of scaling the number of experts high enough to achieve fine-grained specialization. In this paper, we propose the Multilinear Mixture of Experts ($μ$MoE) layer to address this, focusing on vision models. $μ$MoE layers enable scalable expert specialization by performing an implicit computation on prohibitively large weight tensors entirely in factorized form. Consequently, $μ$MoEs (1) avoid the restrictively high inference-time costs of dense MoEs, yet (2) do not inherit the training issues of the popular sparse MoEs' discrete (non-differentiable) expert routing. We present both qualitative and quantitative evidence that scaling $μ$MoE layers when fine-tuning foundation models for vision tasks leads to more specialized experts at the class-level, further enabling manual bias correction in CelebA attribute classification. Finally, we show qualitative results demonstrating the expert specialism achieved when pre-training large GPT2 and MLP-Mixer models with parameter-matched $μ$MoE blocks at every layer, maintaining comparable accuracy.

Incrementally training a model on the newly added sensors would make the model forget the past knowledge, i.e., catastrophic forgetting, while retraining the model on the entire network to capture these changes is highly inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Traffic Forecasting Mixture of Experts (TFMoE) for traffic forecasting under evolving networks. The main idea is to segment the traffic flow into multiple homogeneous groups, and assign an expert model responsible for a specific group. This allows each expert model to concentrate on learning and adapting to a specific set of patterns, while minimizing interference between the experts during training, thereby preventing the dilution or replacement of prior knowledge, which is a major cause of catastrophic forgetting. Through extensive experiments on a real-world long-term streaming network dataset, PEMSD3-Stream, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of TFMoE. Our results showcase superior performance and resilience in the face of catastrophic forgetting, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach in dealing with continual learning for traffic flow forecasting in long-term streaming networks."}

The gating function is maximized for using human-based rules, and classification errors are minimized. We propose solving a coupled multi-objective problem with convex subproblems.

In particular, it was established that DNNs can be used to derive policies that are robust with respect to the information noise statistic affecting the local information (e.g. CSI in a wireless network) used by each agent (e.g. transmitter) to make its decision. While promising, a major challenge in the implementation of such method is that information noise statistics may differ from agent to agent and, more importantly, that such statistics may not be available at the time of training or may evolve over time, making burdensome retraining necessary. This situation makes it desirable to devise a \"universal\" machine learning model, which can be trained once for all so as to allow for decentralized cooperation in any future feedback noise environment. With this goal in mind, we propose an architecture inspired from the well-known Mixture of Experts (MoE) model, which was previously used for non-linear regression and classification tasks in various contexts, such as computer vision and speech recognition. We consider the decentralized power control problem as an example to showcase the validity of the proposed model and to compare it against other power control algorithms.

To further improve speech recognition performance against varying domains and accents, we propose a new router architecture which integrates additional global domain and accent embedding into router input to promote adaptability. Experimental results show that the proposed SpeechMoE2 can achieve lower character error rate (CER) with comparable parameters than SpeechMoE on both multi-domain and multi-accent task. Primarily, the proposed method provides up to 1.6% - 4.8% relative CER improvement for the multidomain task and 1.9% - 17.7% relative CER improvement for the multi-accent task respectively.

The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture stands out for its ability to scale model size without significantly increasing training costs. Despite their advantages, current MoE models often display parameter inefficiency. For instance, a pre-trained MoE-based LLM with 52 billion parameters might perform comparably to a standard model with 6.7 billion parameters. Being a crucial part of MoE, current routers in different layers independently assign tokens without leveraging historical routing information, potentially leading to suboptimal token-expert combinations and the parameter inefficiency problem. To alleviate this issue, we introduce the Layerwise Recurrent Router for Mixture-of-Experts (RMoE). RMoE leverages a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to establish dependencies between routing decisions across consecutive layers. Such layerwise recurrence can be efficiently parallelly computed for input tokens and introduces negotiable costs. Our extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that RMoE-based language models consistently outperform a spectrum of baseline models. Furthermore, RMoE integrates a novel computation stage orthogonal to existing methods, allowing seamless compatibility with other MoE architectures. Our analyses attribute RMoE's gains to its effective cross-layer information sharing, which also improves expert selection and diversity. Our code is at https://github.com/qiuzh20/RMoE ."}

Different from previous efforts, we are dedicated to exploring the dynamic expert path in an already exist MLLM and show that a standard MLLM can be also a mixture of experts. To approach this target, we propose a novel dynamic expert scheme for MLLMs, termed Routing Experts (RoE), which can achieve example-dependent optimal path routing without obvious structure tweaks. Meanwhile, a new regularization of structure sparsity is also introduced to enforce MLLMs to learn more short-cut inference, ensuring the efficiency. In addition, we also realize the first attempt of aligning the training and inference schemes of MLLMs in terms of network routing. To validate RoE, we apply it to a set of latest MLLMs, including LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-HR and VILA, and conduct extensive experiments on a bunch of VL benchmarks. The experiment results not only show the great advantages of our RoE in improving MLLMs' efficiency, but also yield obvious advantages than MoE-LLaVA in both performance and speed, e.g., an average performance gain of 3.3% on 5 benchmarks while being faster."}

DeLLMa involves a multi-step reasoning procedure that integrates recent best practices in scaling inference-time reasoning, drawing upon principles from decision theory and utility theory, to provide an accurate and human-auditable decision-making process. We validate our procedure on multiple realistic decision-making environments, demonstrating that DeLLMa can consistently enhance the decision-making performance of leading language models, and achieve up to a 40% increase in accuracy over competing methods.

However, real-world graphs often possess diverse structures and comprise nodes and edges of varying types. To bolster the generalization capacity of GNNs, it has become customary to augment training graph structures through techniques like graph augmentations and large-scale pre-training on a wider array of graphs. Balancing this diversity while avoiding increased computational costs and the notorious trainability issues of GNNs is crucial. This study introduces the concept of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to GNNs, with the aim of augmenting their capacity to adapt to a diverse range of training graph structures, without incurring explosive computational overhead. The proposed Graph Mixture of Experts (GMoE) model empowers individual nodes in the graph to dynamically and adaptively select more general information aggregation experts. These experts are trained to capture distinct subgroups of graph structures and to incorporate information with varying hop sizes, where those with larger hop sizes specialize in gathering information over longer distances. The effectiveness of GMoE is validated through a series of experiments on a diverse set of tasks, including graph, node, and link prediction, using the OGB benchmark. Notably, it enhances ROC-AUC by $1.81\\%$ in ogbg-molhiv and by $1.40\\%$ in ogbg-molbbbp, when compared to the non-MoE baselines.

However, the understanding of such architecture remains elusive. In this paper, we formally study how the MoE layer improves the performance of neural network learning and why the mixture model will not collapse into a single model. Our empirical results suggest that the cluster structure of the underlying problem and the non-linearity of the expert are pivotal to the success of MoE. To further understand this, we consider a challenging classification problem with intrinsic cluster structures, which is hard to learn using a single expert. Yet with the MoE layer, by choosing the experts as two-layer nonlinear convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we show that the problem can be learned successfully. Furthermore, our theory shows that the router can learn the cluster-center features, which helps divide the input complex problem into simpler linear classification sub-problems that individual experts can conquer. To our knowledge, this is the first result towards formally understanding the mechanism of the MoE layer for deep learning."}

Our investigation confirms that MoE-based LLMs can offer a more favorable cost-effectiveness trade-off than dense LLMs, highlighting the potential effectiveness for future LLM development. One more important contribution of this study is an in-depth analysis of the routing mechanisms within our OpenMoE models, leading to three significant findings: Context-Independent Specialization, Early Routing Learning, and Drop-towards-the-End. We discovered that routing decisions in MoE models are predominantly based on token IDs, with minimal context relevance. The token-to-expert assignments are determined early in the pre-training phase and remain largely unchanged. This imperfect routing can result in performance degradation, particularly in sequential tasks like multi-turn conversations, where tokens appearing later in a sequence are more likely to be dropped. Finally, we rethink our design based on the above-mentioned observations and analysis.

However, it remains challenging to deploy such models in real-life scenarios due to the large memory requirements and inefficient inference. In this work, we introduce a highly efficient inference framework with several optimization approaches to accelerate the computation of sparse models and cut down the memory consumption significantly. While we achieve up to 26x speed-up in terms of throughput, we also reduce the model size almost to one eighth of the original 32-bit float model by quantizing expert weights into 4-bit integers. As a result, we are able to deploy 136x larger models with 27% less cost and significantly better quality compared to the existing solutions.

Although existing optimization methods partially mitigate this issue, they remain constrained by the sequential dependency between communication and computation operations. To address this challenge, we propose ScMoE, a novel shortcut-connected MoE architecture integrated with an overlapping parallelization strategy. ScMoE decouples communication from its conventional sequential ordering, enabling up to 100% overlap with computation. Compared to the prevalent top-2 MoE baseline, ScMoE achieves speedups of 1.49 times in training and 1.82 times in inference.

The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture offers a promising solution by dynamically selecting and activating only a subset of experts during inference, thus substantially reducing computational costs while preserving high performance. Despite these benefits, MoE introduces new inefficiencies, such as excessive parameters and communication overhead. In this work, we present a holistic study of compression techniques for Mixture of Experts to enhance both efficiency and scalability. While recent efforts have focused on Expert Trimming, which reduces the number of experts, these approaches still suffer from considerable communication and computational costs. To address this, we propose more aggressive strategies, such as Layer Drop, which removes entire MoE layers, and Block Drop, which eliminates transformer blocks. Surprisingly, these aggressive pruning techniques not only preserve model performance but also substantially improve computation and memory efficiency. Furthermore, beyond Expert Trimming, we also introduce Expert Slimming, which compresses individual experts to further boost performance and can be seamlessly integrated with Expert Trimming.

From a theoretical viewpoint, finding an efficient and provably consistent algorithm to learn the parameters remains a long standing open problem for more than two decades. In this paper, we introduce the first algorithm that learns the true parameters of a MoE model for a wide class of non-linearities with global consistency guarantees. While existing algorithms jointly or iteratively estimate the expert parameters and the gating paramters in the MoE, we propose a novel algorithm that breaks the deadlock and can directly estimate the expert parameters by sensing its echo in a carefully designed cross-moment tensor between the inputs and the output. Once the experts are known, the recovery of gating parameters still requires an EM algorithm; however, we show that the EM algorithm for this simplified problem, unlike the joint EM algorithm, converges to the true parameters.

Without knowing the generation length of requests, existing serving systems serve requests in a first-come, first-served (FCFS) manner with a fixed batch size, which leads to two problems that affect batch serving efficiency. First, the generation lengths of requests in a batch vary, and requests with short generation lengths must wait for requests with long generation lengths to finish during the batch serving procedure. Second, requests with longer generation lengths consume more memory during serving. Without knowing the generation lengths of batched requests, the batch size is always set small to avoid the out-of-memory (OOM) error, thus preventing the GPU from being fully utilized. In this paper, we find that a significant number of popular applications in the LMaaS scenario have a positive correlation between the generation length and the length of raw user input. Based on this observation, we propose Magnus, which can accurately predict the request generation length with the user input length, application-level, and user-level semantic features. Accordingly, Magnus can achieve high request throughput by batching requests of similar generation lengths together with adaptive batch sizes. Besides, Magnus can also schedule batches with the highest response ratio next (HRRN) policy to reduce request response time.

Inspired by the Global Workspace Theory (GWT), we propose a new fine-tuning method, GW-MoE, to address this issue. The core idea is to broadcast the uncertain tokens across experts during fine-tuning. Therefore, these tokens can acquire the necessary knowledge from any expert during inference and become less sensitive to the choice. GW-MoE does not introduce additional inference overhead.

{"id": "84", "arxiv": "2009.09249v1", "title": "Recursive Experts: An Efficient Optimal Mixture of Learning Systems in Dynamic Environments", "abstract": "Sequential learning systems are used in a wide variety of problems from decision making to optimization, where they provide a 'belief' (opinion) to nature, and then update this belief based on the feedback (result) to minimize (or maximize) some cost or loss (conversely, utility or gain). The goal is to reach an objective by exploiting the temporal relation inherent to the nature's feedback (state). By exploiting this relation, specific learning systems can be designed that perform asymptotically optimal for various applications. However, if the framework of the problem is not stationary, i.e., the nature's state sometimes changes arbitrarily, the past cumulative belief revision done by the system may become useless and the system may fail if it lacks adaptivity. While this adaptivity can be directly implemented in specific cases (e.g., convex optimization), it is mostly not straightforward for general learning tasks. To this end, we propose an efficient optimal mixture framework for general sequential learning systems, which we call the recursive experts for dynamic environments. For this purpose, we design hyper-experts that incorporate the learning systems at our disposal and recursively merge in a specific way to achieve minimax optimal regret bounds up to constant factors. The multiplicative increases in computational complexity from the initial system to our adaptive system are only logarithmic-in-time factors."}

It explores the trade-offs between model size, performance, and computational resources, with the aim of maximizing the efficiency of these AI systems. The research explores novel methods that allow different parts of the model to share parameters, reducing the total number of unique parameters required. This approach ensures that the model remains compact without sacrificing its ability to learn and represent complex language structures. This study provides valuable insights and tools for creating more efficient and effective LLMs, contributing to a more sustainable and accessible future for AI language modeling."}
{"id": "86", "arxiv": "2310.17567v1", "title": "Skill-Mix: a Flexible and Expandable Family of Evaluations for AI models", "abstract": "With LLMs shifting their role from statistical modeling of language to serving as general-purpose AI agents, how should LLM evaluations change? Arguably, a key ability of an AI agent is to flexibly combine, as needed, the basic skills it has learned. The capability to combine skills plays an important role in (human) pedagogy and also in a paper on emergence phenomena (Arora & Goyal, 2023). This work introduces Skill-Mix, a new evaluation to measure ability to combine skills. Using a list of $N$ skills the evaluator repeatedly picks random subsets of $k$ skills and asks the LLM to produce text combining that subset of skills. Since the number of subsets grows like $N^k$, for even modest $k$ this evaluation will, with high probability, require the LLM to produce text significantly different from any text in the training set. The paper develops a methodology for (a) designing and administering such an evaluation, and (b) automatic grading (plus spot-checking by humans) of the results using GPT-4 as well as the open LLaMA-2 70B model. Administering a version of to popular chatbots gave results that, while generally in line with prior expectations, contained surprises. Sizeable differences exist among model capabilities that are not captured by their ranking on popular LLM leaderboards (\"cramming for the leaderboard\"). Furthermore, simple probability calculations indicate that GPT-4's reasonable performance on $k=5$ is suggestive of going beyond \"stochastic parrot\" behavior (Bender et al., 2021), i.e., it combines skills in ways that it had not seen during training. We sketch how the methodology can lead to a Skill-Mix based eco-system of open evaluations for AI capabilities of future models."}

Its training cost saving is demonstrated from encoder-decoder models (prior works) to a 5x saving for auto-aggressive language models (this work along with parallel explorations). However, due to the much larger model size and unique architecture, how to provide fast MoE model inference remains challenging and unsolved, limiting its practical usage. To tackle this, we present DeepSpeed-MoE, an end-to-end MoE training and inference solution as part of the DeepSpeed library, including novel MoE architecture designs and model compression techniques that reduce MoE model size by up to 3.7x, and a highly optimized inference system that provides 7.3x better latency and cost compared to existing MoE inference solutions. DeepSpeed-MoE offers an unprecedented scale and efficiency to serve massive MoE models with up to 4.5x faster and 9x cheaper inference compared to quality-equivalent dense models. We hope our innovations and systems help open a promising path to new directions in the large model landscape, a shift from dense to sparse MoE models, where training and deploying higher-quality models with fewer resources becomes more widely possible."}
{"id": "88", "arxiv": "2103.16716v1", "title": "BASE Layers: Simplifying Training of Large, Sparse Models", "abstract": "We introduce a new balanced assignment of experts (BASE) layer for large language models that greatly simplifies existing high capacity sparse layers. Sparse layers can dramatically improve the efficiency of training and inference by routing each token to specialized expert modules that contain only a small fraction of the model parameters. However, it can be difficult to learn balanced routing functions that make full use of the available experts; existing approaches typically use routing heuristics or auxiliary expert-balancing loss functions. In contrast, we formulate token-to-expert allocation as a linear assignment problem, allowing an optimal assignment in which each expert receives an equal number of tokens. This optimal assignment scheme improves efficiency by guaranteeing balanced compute loads, and also simplifies training by not requiring any new hyperparameters or auxiliary losses.
