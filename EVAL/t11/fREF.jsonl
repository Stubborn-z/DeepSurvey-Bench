A diffusion model is a deep generative model that is based on two stages, a forward diffusion stage and a reverse diffusion stage. In the forward diffusion stage, the input data is gradually perturbed over several steps by adding Gaussian noise. In the reverse stage, a model is tasked at recovering the original input data by learning to gradually reverse the diffusion process, step by step. Diffusion models are widely appreciated for the quality and diversity of the generated samples, despite their known computational burdens, i.e. low speeds due to the high number of steps involved during sampling. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of articles on denoising diffusion models applied in vision, comprising both theoretical and practical contributions in the field. First, we identify and present three generic diffusion modeling frameworks, which are based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models, noise conditioned score networks, and stochastic differential equations. We further discuss the relations between diffusion models and other deep generative models, including variational auto-encoders, generative adversarial networks, energy-based models, autoregressive models and normalizing flows. Then, we introduce a multi-perspective categorization of diffusion models applied in computer vision. Finally, we illustrate the current limitations of diffusion models and envision some interesting directions for future research."}

Recently, the diffusion model has achieved significant advancements in the visual generation of AIGC, thereby raising an intuitive question, \"whether diffusion model can boost image restoration\". To answer this, some pioneering studies attempt to integrate diffusion models into the image restoration task, resulting in superior performances than previous GAN-based methods. Despite that, a comprehensive and enlightening survey on diffusion model-based image restoration remains scarce. In this paper, we are the first to present a comprehensive review of recent diffusion model-based methods on image restoration, encompassing the learning paradigm, conditional strategy, framework design, modeling strategy, and evaluation. Concretely, we first introduce the background of the diffusion model briefly and then present two prevalent workflows that exploit diffusion models in image restoration. Subsequently, we classify and emphasize the innovative designs using diffusion models for both IR and blind/real-world IR, intending to inspire future development. To evaluate existing methods thoroughly, we summarize the commonly-used dataset, implementation details, and evaluation metrics. Additionally, we present the objective comparison for open-sourced methods across three tasks, including image super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting. Ultimately, informed by the limitations in existing works, we propose five potential and challenging directions for the future research of diffusion model-based IR, including sampling efficiency, model compression, distortion simulation and estimation, distortion invariant learning, and framework design."}

Handling generic images requires a diverse underlying generative model, hence the latest works utilize diffusion models, which were shown to surpass GANs in terms of diversity. One major drawback of diffusion models, however, is their relatively slow inference time. In this paper, we present an accelerated solution to the task of local text-driven editing of generic images, where the desired edits are confined to a user-provided mask. Our solution leverages a recent text-to-image Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), which speeds up diffusion by operating in a lower-dimensional latent space. We first convert the LDM into a local image editor by incorporating Blended Diffusion into it. Next we propose an optimization-based solution for the inherent inability of this LDM to accurately reconstruct images. Finally, we address the scenario of performing local edits using thin masks. We evaluate our method against the available baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively and demonstrate that in addition to being faster, our method achieves better precision than the baselines while mitigating some of their artifacts."}

We explore diffusion models for the problem of text-conditional image synthesis and compare two different guidance strategies: CLIP guidance and classifier-free guidance. We find that the latter is preferred by human evaluators for both photorealism and caption similarity, and often produces photorealistic samples. Samples from a 3.5 billion parameter text-conditional diffusion model using classifier-free guidance are favored by human evaluators to those from DALL-E, even when the latter uses expensive CLIP reranking.

In this article, we propose DiffEdit, a method to take advantage of text-conditioned diffusion models for the task of semantic image editing, where the goal is to edit an image based on a text query. Semantic image editing is an extension of image generation, with the additional constraint that the generated image should be as similar as possible to a given input image. Current editing methods based on diffusion models usually require to provide a mask, making the task much easier by treating it as a conditional inpainting task. In contrast, our main contribution is able to automatically generate a mask highlighting regions of the input image that need to be edited, by contrasting predictions of a diffusion model conditioned on different text prompts. Moreover, we rely on latent inference to preserve content in those regions of interest and show excellent synergies with mask-based diffusion. DiffEdit achieves state-of-the-art editing performance on ImageNet. In addition, we evaluate semantic image editing in more challenging settings, using images from the COCO dataset as well as text-based generated images."}

Typically, diffusion models rely on large-scale clean signals to accurately learn the score functions of ground truth clean image distributions. However, such a requirement for large amounts of clean data is often impractical in real-world applications, especially in fields where data samples are expensive to obtain. To address this limitation, in this work, we introduce \\emph{FlowDiff}, a novel joint training paradigm that leverages a conditional normalizing flow model to facilitate the training of diffusion models on corrupted data sources. The conditional normalizing flow try to learn to recover clean images through a novel amortized inference mechanism, and can thus effectively facilitate the diffusion model's training with corrupted data. On the other side, diffusion models provide strong priors which in turn improve the quality of image recovery. The flow model and the diffusion model can therefore promote each other and demonstrate strong empirical performances. Our elaborate experiment shows that FlowDiff can effectively learn clean distributions across a wide range of corrupted data sources, such as noisy and blurry images. It consistently outperforms existing baselines with significant margins under identical conditions. Additionally, we also study the learned diffusion prior, observing its superior performance in downstream computational imaging tasks, including inpainting, denoising, and deblurring."}

While diffusion models have been successfully applied for image editing, very few works have done so for video editing. We present the first diffusion-based method that is able to perform text-based motion and appearance editing of general videos. Our approach uses a video diffusion model to combine, at inference time, the low-resolution spatio-temporal information from the original video with new, high resolution information that it synthesized to align with the guiding text prompt. As obtaining high-fidelity to the original video requires retaining some of its high-resolution information, we add a preliminary stage of finetuning the model on the original video, significantly boosting fidelity. We propose to improve motion editability by a new, mixed objective that jointly finetunes with full temporal attention and with temporal attention masking. We further introduce a new framework for image animation. We first transform the image into a coarse video by simple image processing operations such as replication and perspective geometric projections, and then use our general video editor to animate it. As a further application, we can use our method for subject-driven video generation. Extensive qualitative and numerical experiments showcase the remarkable editing ability of our method and establish its superior performance compared to baseline methods."}

The state-of-the-art approach for real image editing with inversion uses denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIMs) to deterministically noise the image to the intermediate state along the path that the denoising would follow given the original conditioning. However, DDIM inversion for real images is unstable as it relies on local linearization assumptions, which result in the propagation of errors, leading to incorrect image reconstruction and loss of content. To alleviate these problems, we propose Exact Diffusion Inversion via Coupled Transformations (EDICT), an inversion method that draws inspiration from affine coupling layers. EDICT enables mathematically exact inversion of real and model-generated images by maintaining two coupled noise vectors which are used to invert each other in an alternating fashion. Using Stable Diffusion, a state-of-the-art latent diffusion model, we demonstrate that EDICT successfully reconstructs real images with high fidelity. On complex image datasets like MS-COCO, EDICT reconstruction significantly outperforms DDIM, improving the mean square error of reconstruction by a factor of two. Using noise vectors inverted from real images, EDICT enables a wide range of image edits--from local and global semantic edits to image stylization--while maintaining fidelity to the original image structure. EDICT requires no model training/finetuning, prompt tuning, or extra data and can be combined with any pretrained DDM. Code is available at https://github.com/salesforce/EDICT."}

The key challenge is balancing faithfulness to the user input (e.g., hand-drawn colored strokes) and realism of the synthesized image. Existing GAN-based methods attempt to achieve such balance using either conditional GANs or GAN inversions, which are challenging and often require additional training data or loss functions for individual applications. To address these issues, we introduce a new image synthesis and editing method, Stochastic Differential Editing (SDEdit), based on a diffusion model generative prior, which synthesizes realistic images by iteratively denoising through a stochastic differential equation (SDE). Given an input image with user guide of any type, SDEdit first adds noise to the input, then subsequently denoises the resulting image through the SDE prior to increase its realism. SDEdit does not require task-specific training or inversions and can naturally achieve the balance between realism and faithfulness. SDEdit significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GAN-based methods by up to 98.09% on realism and 91.72% on overall satisfaction scores, according to a human perception study, on multiple tasks, including stroke-based image synthesis and editing as well as image compositing."}

Here, the refinement of the generative process in DDPM enables a single DDPM to sample images from various sets directed by the reference image. The proposed ILVR method generates high-quality images while controlling the generation.

To address this, we propose an additional correction term inspired by the manifold constraint, which can be used synergistically with the previous solvers to make the iterations close to the manifold. The proposed manifold constraint is straightforward to implement within a few lines of code, yet boosts the performance by a surprisingly large margin.

One of their critical applications is to universally solve different downstream inverse tasks via a single diffusion prior without re-training for each task. Most inverse tasks can be formulated as inferring a posterior distribution over data (e.g., a full image) given a measurement (e.g., a masked image). This is however challenging in diffusion models since the nonlinear and iterative nature of the diffusion process renders the posterior intractable. To cope with this challenge, we propose a variational approach that by design seeks to approximate the true posterior distribution. We show that our approach naturally leads to regularization by denoising diffusion process (RED-Diff) where denoisers at different timesteps concurrently impose different structural constraints over the image. To gauge the contribution of denoisers from different timesteps, we propose a weighting mechanism based on signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). Our approach provides a new variational perspective for solving inverse problems with diffusion models, allowing us to formulate sampling as stochastic optimization, where one can simply apply off-the-shelf solvers with lightweight iterates. Our experiments for image restoration tasks such as inpainting and superresolution demonstrate the strengths of our method compared with state-of-the-art sampling-based diffusion models."}

But where do such hallucinations come from? In this paper, we study a particular failure mode in diffusion models, which we term mode interpolation. Specifically, we find that diffusion models smoothly \"interpolate\" between nearby data modes in the training set, to generate samples that are completely outside the support of the original training distribution; this phenomenon leads diffusion models to generate artifacts that never existed in real data (i.e., hallucinations). We systematically study the reasons for, and the manifestation of this phenomenon. Through experiments on 1D and 2D Gaussians, we show how a discontinuous loss landscape in the diffusion model's decoder leads to a region where any smooth approximation will cause such hallucinations. Through experiments on artificial datasets with various shapes, we show how hallucination leads to the generation of combinations of shapes that never existed. Finally, we show that diffusion models in fact know when they go out of support and hallucinate. This is captured by the high variance in the trajectory of the generated sample towards the final few backward sampling process. Using a simple metric to capture this variance, we can remove over 95% of hallucinations at generation time while retaining 96% of in-support samples. We conclude our exploration by showing the implications of such hallucination (and its removal) on the collapse (and stabilization) of recursive training on synthetic data with experiments on MNIST and 2D Gaussians dataset.

In making this connection, we bridge the gap between inverse heat dissipation and denoising diffusion, and we shed light on the inductive bias that results from this modeling choice.

Currently, a massive effort is given to enable the modification of these images using text only as means to offer intuitive and versatile editing. To edit a real image using these state-of-the-art tools, one must first invert the image with a meaningful text prompt into the pretrained model's domain. In this paper, we introduce an accurate inversion technique and thus facilitate an intuitive text-based modification of the image. Our proposed inversion consists of two novel key components: (i) Pivotal inversion for diffusion models. While current methods aim at mapping random noise samples to a single input image, we use a single pivotal noise vector for each timestamp and optimize around it. We demonstrate that a direct inversion is inadequate on its own, but does provide a good anchor for our optimization. (ii) NULL-text optimization, where we only modify the unconditional textual embedding that is used for classifier-free guidance, rather than the input text embedding. This allows for keeping both the model weights and the conditional embedding intact and hence enables applying prompt-based editing while avoiding the cumbersome tuning of the model's weights. Our Null-text inversion, based on the publicly available Stable Diffusion model, is extensively evaluated on a variety of images and prompt editing, showing high-fidelity editing of real images."}

Here, we focus on a popular line of text-based editing frameworks - the ``edit-friendly'' DDPM-noise inversion approach. We analyze its application to fast sampling methods and categorize its failures into two classes: the appearance of visual artifacts, and insufficient editing strength. We trace the artifacts to mismatched noise statistics between inverted noises and the expected noise schedule, and suggest a shifted noise schedule which corrects for this offset. To increase editing strength, we propose a pseudo-guidance approach that efficiently increases the magnitude of edits without introducing new artifacts. All in all, our method enables text-based image editing with as few as three diffusion steps, while providing novel insights into the mechanisms behind popular text-based editing approaches."}

Then, a backward - reverse diffusion - process gradually removes the noise to turn it into a sample of the target distribution being modelled. DMs are inspired by non-equilibrium thermodynamics and have inherent high computational complexity. Due to the frequent function evaluations and gradient calculations in high-dimensional spaces, these models incur considerable computational overhead during both training and inference stages. This can not only preclude the democratization of diffusion-based modelling, but also hinder the adaption of diffusion models in real-life applications. Not to mention, the efficiency of computational models is fast becoming a significant concern due to excessive energy consumption and environmental scares. These factors have led to multiple contributions in the literature that focus on devising computationally efficient DMs. In this review, we present the most recent advances in diffusion models for vision, specifically focusing on the important design aspects that affect the computational efficiency of DMs. In particular, we emphasize the recently proposed design choices that have led to more efficient DMs. Unlike the other recent reviews, which discuss diffusion models from a broad perspective, this survey is aimed at pushing this research direction forward by highlighting the design strategies in the literature that are resulting in practicable models for the broader research community.

To address this issue, this study proposes a novel and efficient diffusion model for IR that significantly reduces the required number of diffusion steps. Our method avoids the need for post-acceleration during inference, thereby avoiding the associated performance deterioration. Specifically, our proposed method establishes a Markov chain that facilitates the transitions between the high-quality and low-quality images by shifting their residuals, substantially improving the transition efficiency. A carefully formulated noise schedule is devised to flexibly control the shifting speed and the noise strength during the diffusion process.

Our approach targets interactive image editing applications in which, starting from a blank canvas or an image, a user specifies a sequence of localized image modifications using binary masks and text prompts. Our generator operates in two phases. First, a context encoder processes the current canvas and user mask to produce a compact global context tailored to the region to generate. Second, conditioned on this context, a diffusion-based transformer decoder synthesizes the masked pixels in a \"lazy\" fashion, i.e., it only generates the masked region. This contrasts with previous works that either regenerate the full canvas, wasting time and computation, or confine processing to a tight rectangular crop around the mask, ignoring the global image context altogether. Our decoder's runtime scales with the mask size, which is typically small, while our encoder introduces negligible overhead. We demonstrate that our approach is competitive with state-of-the-art inpainting methods in terms of quality and fidelity while providing a 10x speedup for typical user interactions, where the editing mask represents 10% of the image."}

In this paper we demonstrate, for the very first time, the ability to apply complex (e.g., non-rigid) text-guided semantic edits to a single real image. For example, we can change the posture and composition of one or multiple objects inside an image, while preserving its original characteristics. Our method can make a standing dog sit down or jump, cause a bird to spread its wings, etc. -- each within its single high-resolution natural image provided by the user. Contrary to previous work, our proposed method requires only a single input image and a target text (the desired edit). It operates on real images, and does not require any additional inputs (such as image masks or additional views of the object). Our method, which we call \"Imagic\", leverages a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model for this task. It produces a text embedding that aligns with both the input image and the target text, while fine-tuning the diffusion model to capture the image-specific appearance. We demonstrate the quality and versatility of our method on numerous inputs from various domains, showcasing a plethora of high quality complex semantic image edits, all within a single unified framework."}

Such success inspires many efforts trying to use large-scale pre-trained diffusion models for tackling a challenging problem--real image editing. Works conducted in this area learn a unique textual token corresponding to several images containing the same object. However, under many circumstances, only one image is available, such as the painting of the Girl with a Pearl Earring. Using existing works on fine-tuning the pre-trained diffusion models with a single image causes severe overfitting issues. The information leakage from the pre-trained diffusion models makes editing can not keep the same content as the given image while creating new features depicted by the language guidance. This work aims to address the problem of single-image editing. We propose a novel model-based guidance built upon the classifier-free guidance so that the knowledge from the model trained on a single image can be distilled into the pre-trained diffusion model, enabling content creation even with one given image. Additionally, we propose a patch-based fine-tuning that can effectively help the model generate images of arbitrary resolution. We provide extensive experiments to validate the design choices of our approach and show promising editing capabilities, including changing style, content addition, and object manipulation.

While previous research has primarily focused on improving the control of image generation through adjusting the denoising process, we propose a novel direction of manipulating the initial noise to control the generated image. Through experiments on stable diffusion, we show that blocks of pixels in the initial latent images have a preference for generating specific content, and that modifying these blocks can significantly influence the generated image. In particular, we show that modifying a part of the initial image affects the corresponding region of the generated image while leaving other regions unaffected, which is useful for repainting tasks. Furthermore, we find that the generation preferences of pixel blocks are primarily determined by their values, rather than their position. By moving pixel blocks with a tendency to generate user-desired content to user-specified regions, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in layout-to-image generation.

It is therefore greatly desirable to establish a backward diffusion model which implements a smart stabilisation approach that can be used in combination with an easy to handle numerical scheme. So far, existing stabilisation strategies in literature require sophisticated numerics to solve the underlying initial value problem. We derive a class of space-discrete one-dimensional backward diffusion as gradient descent of energies where we gain stability by imposing range constraints. Interestingly, these energies are even convex. Furthermore, we establish a comprehensive theory for the time-continuous evolution and we show that stability carries over to a simple explicit time discretisation of our model.

However, they remain underutilized in medical imaging, a field crucial for disease diagnosis and treatment planning. This is primarily due to the high computational cost associated with (1) the use of large number of time steps (e.g., 1,000) in diffusion processes and (2) the increased dimensionality of medical images, which are often 3D or 4D. Training a diffusion model on medical images typically takes days to weeks, while sampling each image volume takes minutes to hours. To address this challenge, we introduce Fast-DDPM, a simple yet effective approach capable of improving training speed, sampling speed, and generation quality simultaneously. Unlike DDPM, which trains the image denoiser across 1,000 time steps, Fast-DDPM trains and samples using only 10 time steps. The key to our method lies in aligning the training and sampling procedures to optimize time-step utilization. Specifically, we introduced two efficient noise schedulers with 10 time steps: one with uniform time step sampling and another with non-uniform sampling. We evaluated Fast-DDPM across three medical image-to-image generation tasks: multi-image super-resolution, image denoising, and image-to-image translation. Fast-DDPM outperformed DDPM and current state-of-the-art methods based on convolutional networks and generative adversarial networks in all tasks. Additionally, Fast-DDPM reduced the training time to 0.2x and the sampling time to 0.01x compared to DDPM. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/mirthAI/Fast-DDPM."}

We achieve this goal by leveraging self-supervised training to disentangle and re-organize the source image and the exemplar. However, the naive approach will cause obvious fusing artifacts. We carefully analyze it and propose an information bottleneck and strong augmentations to avoid the trivial solution of directly copying and pasting the exemplar image. Meanwhile, to ensure the controllability of the editing process, we design an arbitrary shape mask for the exemplar image and leverage the classifier-free guidance to increase the similarity to the exemplar image.

This limitation has hindered their usage in both 2D and 3D applications. To address this problem, we explored the use of negative prompts but found that the current implementation fails to produce desired results, particularly when there is an overlap between the main and negative prompts. To overcome this issue, we propose Perp-Neg, a new algorithm that leverages the geometrical properties of the score space to address the shortcomings of the current negative prompts algorithm. Perp-Neg does not require any training or fine-tuning of the model. Moreover, we experimentally demonstrate that Perp-Neg provides greater flexibility in generating images by enabling users to edit out unwanted concepts from the initially generated images in 2D cases. Furthermore, to extend the application of Perp-Neg to 3D, we conducted a thorough exploration of how Perp-Neg can be used in 2D to condition the diffusion model to generate desired views, rather than being biased toward the canonical views.

Despite the great progress, existing diffusion models mainly focus on uni-modal control, i.e., the diffusion process is driven by only one modality of condition. To further unleash the users' creativity, it is desirable for the model to be controllable by multiple modalities simultaneously, e.g., generating and editing faces by describing the age (text-driven) while drawing the face shape (mask-driven). In this work, we present Collaborative Diffusion, where pre-trained uni-modal diffusion models collaborate to achieve multi-modal face generation and editing without re-training. Our key insight is that diffusion models driven by different modalities are inherently complementary regarding the latent denoising steps, where bilateral connections can be established upon. Specifically, we propose dynamic diffuser, a meta-network that adaptively hallucinates multi-modal denoising steps by predicting the spatial-temporal influence functions for each pre-trained uni-modal model. Collaborative Diffusion not only collaborates generation capabilities from uni-modal diffusion models, but also integrates multiple uni-modal manipulations to perform multi-modal editing.

Despite their success, there is still limited understanding of their semantic spaces. This makes it challenging to achieve precise and disentangled image generation without additional training, especially in an unsupervised way. In this work, we improve the understanding of their semantic spaces from intriguing observations: among a certain range of noise levels, (1) the learned posterior mean predictor (PMP) in the diffusion model is locally linear, and (2) the singular vectors of its Jacobian lie in low-dimensional semantic subspaces. We provide a solid theoretical basis to justify the linearity and low-rankness in the PMP.

LOCO Edit identified editing directions with nice properties: homogeneity, transferability, composability, and linearity. These properties of LOCO Edit benefit greatly from the low-dimensional semantic subspace.

In analogy with GANs, those noise maps could be considered as the latent code associated with the generated image. However, this native noise space does not possess a convenient structure, and is thus challenging to work with in editing tasks. Here, we propose an alternative latent noise space for DDPM that enables a wide range of editing operations via simple means, and present an inversion method for extracting these edit-friendly noise maps for any given image (real or synthetically generated). As opposed to the native DDPM noise space, the edit-friendly noise maps do not have a standard normal distribution and are not statistically independent across timesteps. However, they allow perfect reconstruction of any desired image, and simple transformations on them translate into meaningful manipulations of the output image (e.g. shifting, color edits). Moreover, in text-conditional models, fixing those noise maps while changing the text prompt, modifies semantics while retaining structure. We illustrate how this property enables text-based editing of real images via the diverse DDPM sampling scheme (in contrast to the popular non-diverse DDIM inversion).

Although the simple generative process surprisingly works well, is this the best way to generate image data? For instance, despite the fact that human perception is more sensitive to the low frequencies of an image, diffusion models themselves do not consider any relative importance of each frequency component. Therefore, to incorporate the inductive bias for image data, we propose a novel generative process that synthesizes images in a coarse-to-fine manner. First, we generalize the standard diffusion models by enabling diffusion in a rotated coordinate system with different velocities for each component of the vector. We further propose a blur diffusion as a special case, where each frequency component of an image is diffused at different speeds. Specifically, the proposed blur diffusion consists of a forward process that blurs an image and adds noise gradually, after which a corresponding reverse process deblurs an image and removes noise progressively.

In this paper, we aim to answer how unmasked semantics guide texture denoising process;together with how to tackle the semantic discrepancy, to facilitate the consistent and meaningful semantics generation. To this end, we propose a novel structure-guided diffusion model named StrDiffusion, to reformulate the conventional texture denoising process under structure guidance to derive a simplified denoising objective for image inpainting, while revealing: 1) the semantically sparse structure is beneficial to tackle semantic discrepancy in early stage, while dense texture generates reasonable semantics in late stage; 2) the semantics from unmasked regions essentially offer the time-dependent structure guidance for the texture denoising process, benefiting from the time-dependent sparsity of the structure semantics. For the denoising process, a structure-guided neural network is trained to estimate the simplified denoising objective by exploiting the consistency of the denoised structure between masked and unmasked regions.

They support inverting real images and conditional (e.g., text) generation, making them attractive for high-quality image editing applications. We investigate how to use such pre-trained image models for text-guided video editing. The critical challenge is to achieve the target edits while still preserving the content of the source video. Our method works in two simple steps: first, we use a pre-trained structure-guided (e.g., depth) image diffusion model to perform text-guided edits on an anchor frame; then, in the key step, we progressively propagate the changes to the future frames via self-attention feature injection to adapt the core denoising step of the diffusion model. We then consolidate the changes by adjusting the latent code for the frame before continuing the process. Our approach is training-free and generalizes to a wide range of edits. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by extensive experimentation and compare it against four different prior and parallel efforts (on ArXiv). We demonstrate that realistic text-guided video edits are possible, without any compute-intensive preprocessing or video-specific finetuning."}

This prevents diffusion models from being applied to natural video editing in practical scenarios. In this paper, we tackle this problem by introducing temporal dependency to existing text-driven diffusion models, which allows them to generate consistent appearance for the edited objects. Specifically, we develop a novel inter-frame propagation mechanism for diffusion video editing, which leverages the concept of layered representations to propagate the appearance information from one frame to the next. We then build up a text-driven video editing framework based on this mechanism, namely StableVideo, which can achieve consistency-aware video editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the strong editing capability of our approach.

We tackle this problem by proposing a new architecture based on latent diffusion models, an approach that has not been used before in the fashion domain.

Although existing methods ensure reconstruction fidelity through optimization, a drawback of these is the significant amount of time required for optimization. In this paper, we propose negative-prompt inversion, a method capable of achieving equivalent reconstruction solely through forward propagation without optimization, thereby enabling ultrafast editing processes. We experimentally demonstrate that the reconstruction fidelity of our method is comparable to that of existing methods, allowing for inversion at a resolution of 512 pixels and with 50 sampling steps within approximately 5 seconds, which is more than 30 times faster than null-text inversion. Reduction of the computation time by the proposed method further allows us to use a larger number of sampling steps in diffusion models to improve the reconstruction fidelity with a moderate increase in computation time."}

Based on this success, current image editing methods use texts to achieve intuitive and versatile modification of images. To edit a real image using diffusion models, one must first invert the image to a noisy latent from which an edited image is sampled with a target text prompt. However, most methods lack one of the following: user-friendliness (e.g., additional masks or precise descriptions of the input image are required), generalization to larger domains, or high fidelity to the input image. In this paper, we design an accurate and quick inversion technique, Prompt Tuning Inversion, for text-driven image editing. Specifically, our proposed editing method consists of a reconstruction stage and an editing stage. In the first stage, we encode the information of the input image into a learnable conditional embedding via Prompt Tuning Inversion. In the second stage, we apply classifier-free guidance to sample the edited image, where the conditional embedding is calculated by linearly interpolating between the target embedding and the optimized one obtained in the first stage. This technique ensures a superior trade-off between editability and high fidelity to the input image of our method. For example, we can change the color of a specific object while preserving its original shape and background under the guidance of only a target text prompt. Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate the superior editing performance of our method compared to the state-of-the-art baselines."}

However, most use cases of diffusion models are not concerned with likelihoods, but instead with downstream objectives such as human-perceived image quality or drug effectiveness. In this paper, we investigate reinforcement learning methods for directly optimizing diffusion models for such objectives. We describe how posing denoising as a multi-step decision-making problem enables a class of policy gradient algorithms, which we refer to as denoising diffusion policy optimization (DDPO), that are more effective than alternative reward-weighted likelihood approaches. Empirically, DDPO is able to adapt text-to-image diffusion models to objectives that are difficult to express via prompting, such as image compressibility, and those derived from human feedback, such as aesthetic quality. Finally, we show that DDPO can improve prompt-image alignment using feedback from a vision-language model without the need for additional data collection or human annotation.

Such images, for example images with phase or directional entries or with values in the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices, are frequently encountered in real-world applications. Generalizing the normal law to manifolds is not canonical and different attempts have been considered. Here we focus on a straightforward intrinsic model and discuss the relation to other approaches for specific manifolds. We reinterpret the Bayesian approach of Lebrun et al.

With this estimator at hand we present a nonlocal patch-based method for the restoration of manifold-valued images.

However, acquiring high signal-to-noise ratio MRI scans requires long scan times, resulting in increased costs and patient discomfort, and decreased throughput. Thus, there is great interest in denoising MRI scans, especially for the subtype of diffusion MRI scans that are severely SNR-limited. While most prior MRI denoising methods are supervised in nature, acquiring supervised training datasets for the multitude of anatomies, MRI scanners, and scan parameters proves impractical. Here, we propose Denoising Diffusion Models for Denoising Diffusion MRI (DDM$^2$), a self-supervised denoising method for MRI denoising using diffusion denoising generative models. Our three-stage framework integrates statistic-based denoising theory into diffusion models and performs denoising through conditional generation. During inference, we represent input noisy measurements as a sample from an intermediate posterior distribution within the diffusion Markov chain. We conduct experiments on 4 real-world in-vivo diffusion MRI datasets and show that our DDM$^2$ demonstrates superior denoising performances ascertained with clinically-relevant visual qualitative and quantitative metrics."}

Are randomly sampled Gaussian noises equally good for diffusion models? While a large body of works tried to understand and improve diffusion models, previous works overlooked the possibility to select or optimize the sampled noise the possibility of selecting or optimizing sampled noises for improving diffusion models. In this paper, we mainly made three contributions. First, we report that not all noises are created equally for diffusion models. We are the first to hypothesize and empirically observe that the generation quality of diffusion models significantly depend on the noise inversion stability. This naturally provides us a noise selection method according to the inversion stability. Second, we further propose a novel noise optimization method that actively enhances the inversion stability of arbitrary given noises. Our method is the first one that works on noise space to generally improve generated results without fine-tuning diffusion models. Third, our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed noise selection and noise optimization methods both significantly improve representative diffusion models, such as SDXL and SDXL-turbo, in terms of human preference and other objective evaluation metrics. For example, the human preference winning rates of noise selection and noise optimization over the baselines can be up to 57% and 72.5%, respectively, on DrawBench."}

When using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), one major hurdle is in the inversion process mapping a real image to its corresponding noise vector in the latent space, since its necessary to be able to reconstruct an image to edit its contents. Likewise for Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM), the linearization assumption in each inversion step makes the whole deterministic inversion process unreliable. Existing approaches that have tackled the problem of inversion stability often incur in significant trade-offs in computational efficiency. In this work we propose an Accelerated Iterative Diffusion Inversion method, dubbed AIDI, that significantly improves reconstruction accuracy with minimal additional overhead in space and time complexity. By using a novel blended guidance technique, we show that effective results can be obtained on a large range of image editing tasks without large classifier-free guidance in inversion. Furthermore, when compared with other diffusion inversion based works, our proposed process is shown to be more robust for fast image editing in the 10 and 20 diffusion steps' regimes."}

To address this problem, we propose Localization-aware Inversion (LocInv), which exploits segmentation maps or bounding boxes as extra localization priors to refine the cross-attention maps in the denoising phases of the diffusion process. Through the dynamic updating of tokens corresponding to noun words in the textual input, we are compelling the cross-attention maps to closely align with the correct noun and adjective words in the text prompt. Based on this technique, we achieve fine-grained image editing over particular objects while preventing undesired changes to other regions.

Here, we address the optimal conditioning of diffusion models for solving challenging inverse problems that arise during image reconstruction. Specifically, we propose a novel Bayesian conditioning technique for diffusion models, BCDM, based on score-functions associated with the conditional distribution of desired images given measured data. We rigorously derive the theory to express and train the conditional score-function.

Additionally, it also takes advantage of the strengths of wavelet transformation to greatly accelerate inference and reduce computational resource usage without sacrificing information. To avoid chaotic content and diversity, we perform both forward diffusion and denoising in the training phase of WCDM, enabling the model to achieve stable denoising and reduce randomness during inference. Moreover, we further design a high-frequency restoration module (HFRM) that utilizes the vertical and horizontal details of the image to complement the diagonal information for better fine-grained restoration. Extensive experiments on publicly available real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and visually, and it achieves remarkable improvements in efficiency compared to previous diffusion-based methods.

Specifically, in the context of diffusion-based editing, where a source image is edited according to a target prompt, the process commences by acquiring a noisy latent vector corresponding to the source image via the diffusion model. This vector is subsequently fed into separate source and target diffusion branches for editing. The accuracy of this inversion process significantly impacts the final editing outcome, influencing both essential content preservation of the source image and edit fidelity according to the target prompt. Prior inversion techniques aimed at finding a unified solution in both the source and target diffusion branches. However, our theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that disentangling these branches leads to a distinct separation of responsibilities for preserving essential content and ensuring edit fidelity. Building on this insight, we introduce \"Direct Inversion,\" a novel technique achieving optimal performance of both branches with just three lines of code.

However, for many applications such as image editing, the model input comes from a distribution that is not random noise. As such, diffusion models must rely on cumbersome methods like guidance or projected sampling to incorporate this information in the generative process. In our work, we propose Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models (DDBMs), a natural alternative to this paradigm based on diffusion bridges, a family of processes that interpolate between two paired distributions given as endpoints. Our method learns the score of the diffusion bridge from data and maps from one endpoint distribution to the other by solving a (stochastic) differential equation based on the learned score. Our method naturally unifies several classes of generative models, such as score-based diffusion models and OT-Flow-Matching, allowing us to adapt existing design and architectural choices to our more general problem. Empirically, we apply DDBMs to challenging image datasets in both pixel and latent space. On standard image translation problems, DDBMs achieve significant improvement over baseline methods, and, when we reduce the problem to image generation by setting the source distribution to random noise, DDBMs achieve comparable FID scores to state-of-the-art methods despite being built for a more general task."}
