Recent studies have explored human-like problem-solving strategies, such as self-correct, to push further the boundary of single-model reasoning ability. In this work, we let a single model \"step outside the box\" by engaging multiple models to correct each other. We introduce a multi-agent collaboration strategy that emulates the academic peer review process. Each agent independently constructs its own solution, provides reviews on the solutions of others, and assigns confidence levels to its reviews. Upon receiving peer reviews, agents revise their initial solutions. Extensive experiments on three different types of reasoning tasks show that our collaboration approach delivers superior accuracy across all ten datasets compared to existing methods.

LLMs are appearing rapidly, and debates on LLM capacities have taken off, but reflection is lagging behind. Thus, in this position paper, we first zoom in on the debate and critically assess three points recurring in critiques of LLM capacities: i) that LLMs only parrot statistical patterns in the training data; ii) that LLMs master formal but not functional language competence; and iii) that language learning in LLMs cannot inform human language learning. Drawing on empirical and theoretical arguments, we show that these points need more nuance. Second, we outline a pragmatic perspective on the issue of `real' understanding and intentionality in LLMs. Understanding and intentionality pertain to unobservable mental states we attribute to other humans because they have pragmatic value: they allow us to abstract away from complex underlying mechanics and predict behaviour effectively. We reflect on the circumstances under which it would make sense for humans to similarly attribute mental states to LLMs, thereby outlining a pragmatic philosophical context for LLMs as an increasingly prominent technology in society."}

Such capabilities are crucial if LLMs are to effectively mimic human-like social behaviors and form efficient teams to solve tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce MetaAgents, a social simulation framework populated with LLM-based agents. MetaAgents facilitates agent engagement in conversations and a series of decision making within social contexts, serving as an appropriate platform for investigating interactions and interpersonal decision-making of agents. In particular, we construct a job fair environment as a case study to scrutinize the team assembly and skill-matching behaviors of LLM-based agents. We take advantage of both quantitative metrics evaluation and qualitative text analysis to assess their teaming abilities at the job fair. Our evaluation demonstrates that LLM-based agents perform competently in making rational decisions to develop efficient teams.

A Structural Analysis of the Human Reasoning System for Elucidating LLM Capabilities and Risks Through the Lens of Heidegger's Philosophy", "abstract": "In the rapidly evolving field of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a critical need to thoroughly analyze their capabilities and risks. Central to our investigation are two novel elements. Firstly, it is the innovative parallels between the statistical patterns of word relationships within LLMs and Martin Heidegger's concepts of \"ready-to-hand\" and \"present-at-hand,\" which encapsulate the utilitarian and scientific altitudes humans employ in interacting with the world. This comparison lays the groundwork for positioning LLMs as the digital counterpart to the Faculty of Verbal Knowledge, shedding light on their capacity to emulate certain facets of human reasoning. Secondly, a structural analysis of human reasoning, viewed through Heidegger's notion of truth as \"unconcealment\" is conducted This foundational principle enables us to map out the inputs and outputs of the reasoning system and divide reasoning into four distinct categories. Respective cognitive faculties are delineated, allowing us to place LLMs within the broader schema of human reasoning, thus clarifying their strengths and inherent limitations. Our findings reveal that while LLMs possess the capability for Direct Explicative Reasoning and Pseudo Rational Reasoning, they fall short in authentic rational reasoning and have no creative reasoning capabilities, due to the current lack of many analogous AI models such as the Faculty of Judgement. The potential and risks of LLMs when they are augmented with other AI technologies are also evaluated. The results indicate that although LLMs have achieved proficiency in some reasoning abilities, the aspiration to match or exceed human intellectual capabilities is yet unattained. This research not only enriches our comprehension of LLMs but also propels forward the discourse on AI's potential and its bounds, paving the way for future explorations into AI's evolving landscape."}

They have disrupted human-technology interaction and the way businesses operate. However, technologies based on generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) are known to hallucinate, misinform, and display biases introduced by the massive datasets on which they are trained. Existing research indicates that humans may unconsciously internalize these biases, which can persist even after they stop using the programs. This study explores the cultural self-perception of LLMs by prompting ChatGPT (OpenAI) and Bard (Google) with value questions derived from the GLOBE project. The findings reveal that their cultural self-perception is most closely aligned with the values of English-speaking countries and countries characterized by sustained economic competitiveness. Recognizing the cultural biases of LLMs and understanding how they work is crucial for all members of society because one does not want the black box of artificial intelligence to perpetuate bias in humans, who might, in turn, inadvertently create and train even more biased algorithms."}

However, despite these successes, the depth of LLMs' reasoning abilities remains uncertain. This uncertainty partly stems from the predominant focus on task performance, measured through shallow accuracy metrics, rather than a thorough investigation of the models' reasoning behavior. This paper seeks to address this gap by providing a comprehensive review of studies that go beyond task accuracy, offering deeper insights into the models' reasoning processes. Furthermore, we survey prevalent methodologies to evaluate the reasoning behavior of LLMs, emphasizing current trends and efforts towards more nuanced reasoning analyses. Our review suggests that LLMs tend to rely on surface-level patterns and correlations in their training data, rather than on sophisticated reasoning abilities. Additionally, we identify the need for further research that delineates the key differences between human and LLM-based reasoning. Through this survey, we aim to shed light on the complex reasoning processes within LLMs."}

However, most existing LLM-based multi-agent approaches rely on predefined agents to handle simple tasks, limiting the adaptability of multi-agent collaboration to different scenarios. Therefore, we introduce AutoAgents, an innovative framework that adaptively generates and coordinates multiple specialized agents to build an AI team according to different tasks. Specifically, AutoAgents couples the relationship between tasks and roles by dynamically generating multiple required agents based on task content and planning solutions for the current task based on the generated expert agents. Multiple specialized agents collaborate with each other to efficiently accomplish tasks. Concurrently, an observer role is incorporated into the framework to reflect on the designated plans and agents' responses and improve upon them. Our experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that AutoAgents generates more coherent and accurate solutions than the existing multi-agent methods. This underscores the significance of assigning different roles to different tasks and of team cooperation, offering new perspectives for tackling complex tasks.

However, most existing methods either take actions greedily without planning or rely on static plans that are not adaptable to environmental feedback. Consequently, the sequential decision-making performance of LLM agents degenerates with problem complexity and plan horizons increase. We propose a closed-loop approach, AdaPlanner, which allows the LLM agent to refine its self-generated plan adaptively in response to environmental feedback. In AdaPlanner, the LLM agent adaptively refines its plan from feedback with both in-plan and out-of-plan refinement strategies. To mitigate hallucination, we develop a code-style LLM prompt structure that facilitates plan generation across a variety of tasks, environments, and agent capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a skill discovery mechanism that leverages successful plans as few-shot exemplars, enabling the agent to plan and refine with fewer task demonstrations. Our experiments in the ALFWorld and MiniWoB++ environments demonstrate that AdaPlanner outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 3.73% and 4.11% while utilizing 2x and 600x fewer samples, respectively."}

Existing approaches, including multi-agent LLM systems, offer solutions to certain challenges but still require manual setup and lack scalability. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach leveraging decomposition to enable LLMs to tackle vague problems effectively. Our approach involves an orchestrating LLM that interacts with users to understand the problem and then decomposes it into tangible sub-problems. Instead of expecting the LLM to solve the entire problem in one go, we train it to ask follow-up questions to gain a deeper understanding of the user's requirements. Once the problem is adequately understood, the orchestrating LLM divides it into smaller, manageable sub-problems. Each sub-problem is then assigned to specialized LLM agents or non-LLM functions for resolution. These agents work in parallel to solve their respective sub-problems, with the orchestrating LLM overseeing the process and compiling the solutions into a comprehensive answer for the user. By adopting this decomposition approach, we alleviate the constraints imposed by token limitations on LLM outputs and empower them to provide nuanced solutions to complex and ambiguous problems. Through our approach, we aim to enable LLMs to think and operate more like humans, breaking down complex problems into manageable parts and collaboratively solving them. This not only enhances the problem-solving capabilities of LLMs but also offers a scalable and efficient method for addressing a wide range of real-world challenges."}

Such approaches implicitly treat discrepancies in recommended items as biases, overlooking whether these changes might stem from genuine personalization aligned with the true preferences of users. Moreover, these earlier studies typically address single sensitive attributes in isolation, neglecting the complex interplay of intersectional identities. In response to these shortcomings, we introduce CFaiRLLM, an enhanced evaluation framework that not only incorporates true preference alignment but also rigorously examines intersectional fairness by considering overlapping sensitive attributes. Additionally, CFaiRLLM introduces diverse user profile sampling strategies-random, top-rated, and recency-focused-to better understand the impact of profile generation fed to LLMs in light of inherent token limitations in these systems. Given that fairness depends on accurately understanding users' tastes and preferences, these strategies provide a more realistic assessment of fairness within RecLLMs. To validate the efficacy of CFaiRLLM, we conducted extensive experiments using MovieLens and LastFM datasets, applying various sampling strategies and sensitive attribute configurations. The evaluation metrics include both item similarity measures and true preference alignment considering both hit and ranking (Jaccard Similarity and PRAG), thereby conducting a multifaceted analysis of recommendation fairness."}

Towards practical adoption of LLMs, multi-agent systems hold great promise to augment, integrate, and orchestrate LLMs in the larger context of enterprise platforms that use existing proprietary data and models to tackle complex real-world tasks. Despite the tremendous success of these systems, current approaches rely on narrow, single-focus objectives for optimization and evaluation, often overlooking potential constraints in real-world scenarios, including restricted budgets, resources and time. Furthermore, interpreting, analyzing, and debugging these systems requires different components to be evaluated in relation to one another. This demand is currently not feasible with existing methodologies. In this postion paper, we introduce the concept of reasoning capacity as a unifying criterion to enable integration of constraints during optimization and establish connections among different components within the system, which also enable a more holistic and comprehensive approach to evaluation. We present a formal definition of reasoning capacity and illustrate its utility in identifying limitations within each component of the system. We then argue how these limitations can be addressed with a self-reflective process wherein human-feedback is used to alleviate shortcomings in reasoning and enhance overall consistency of the system."}

These environments are often highly expansive, making it impossible for the LLM to process them within its short-term memory. Motivated by recent research on extending the capabilities of LLMs with tools, we seek to investigate the intriguing potential of tools to augment LLMs in handling such complexity by introducing a novel class of tools, termed middleware, to aid in the proactive exploration within these massive environments. Such specialized tools can serve as a middleware layer shielding the LLM from environmental complexity. In two representative complex environments -- knowledge bases (KBs) and databases -- we demonstrate the significant potential of augmenting language agents with tools in complex environments. Notably, equipped with the middleware, GPT-4 achieves 2.8X the performance of the best baseline in tasks requiring access to database content and 2.2X in KB tasks.

Currently, the design and implementation of such agents is ad hoc, as the wide variety of tasks that LLM-based agents may be applied to naturally means there can be no one-size-fits-all approach to agent design. In this work we aim to alleviate the difficulty of designing and implementing new agents by proposing a minimalistic generation framework that simplifies the process of building agents. The framework we introduce allows the user to define desired agent behaviors in a high-level, declarative specification that is then used to construct a decoding monitor which guarantees the LLM will produce an output exhibiting the desired behavior. Our declarative approach, in which the behavior is described without concern for how it should be implemented or enforced, enables rapid design, implementation, and experimentation with different LLM-based agents. We demonstrate how the proposed framework can be used to implement recent LLM-based agents (e.g., ReACT), and show how the flexibility of our approach can be leveraged to define a new agent with more complex behavior, the Plan-Act-Summarize-Solve (PASS) agent. Lastly, we demonstrate that our method outperforms other agents on multiple popular reasoning-centric question-answering benchmarks."}

While these models play an increasingly prominent role in shaping the digital landscape, two growing concerns emerge in healthcare applications: 1) to what extent do LLMs exhibit social bias based on patients' protected attributes (like race), and 2) how do design choices (like architecture design and prompting strategies) influence the observed biases? To answer these questions rigorously, we evaluated eight popular LLMs across three question-answering (QA) datasets using clinical vignettes (patient descriptions) standardized for bias evaluations. We employ red-teaming strategies to analyze how demographics affect LLM outputs, comparing both general-purpose and clinically-trained models. Our extensive experiments reveal various disparities (some significant) across protected groups. We also observe several counter-intuitive patterns such as larger models not being necessarily less biased and fined-tuned models on medical data not being necessarily better than the general-purpose models. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the impact of prompt design on bias patterns and shows that specific phrasing can influence bias patterns and reflection-type approaches (like Chain of Thought) can reduce biased outcomes effectively. Consistent with prior studies, we call on additional evaluations, scrutiny, and enhancement of LLMs used in clinical decision support applications."}

At a time when improving health care quality and access remains a critical concern for countries worldwide, the ability of these models to pass medical examinations is often cited as a reason to use them for medical training and diagnosis. However, the impact of their inevitable use as a self-diagnostic tool and their role in spreading healthcare misinformation has not been evaluated. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of LLMs, particularly ChatGPT, from the perspective of an individual self-diagnosing to better understand the clarity, correctness, and robustness of the models. We propose the comprehensive testing methodology evaluation of LLM prompts (EvalPrompt). This evaluation methodology uses multiple-choice medical licensing examination questions to evaluate LLM responses. We use open-ended questions to mimic real-world self-diagnosis use cases, and perform sentence dropout to mimic realistic self-diagnosis with missing information. Human evaluators then assess the responses returned by ChatGPT for both experiments for clarity, correctness, and robustness. The results highlight the modest capabilities of LLMs, as their responses are often unclear and inaccurate. As a result, medical advice by LLMs should be cautiously approached. However, evidence suggests that LLMs are steadily improving and could potentially play a role in healthcare systems in the future. To address the issue of medical misinformation, there is a pressing need for the development of a comprehensive self-diagnosis dataset.

However, the growing intertwining of big models with everyday human lives poses potential risks and might cause serious social harm. Therefore, many efforts have been made to align LLMs with humans to make them better follow user instructions and satisfy human preferences. Nevertheless, `what to align with' has not been fully discussed, and inappropriate alignment goals might even backfire. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of different alignment goals in existing work and trace their evolution paths to help identify the most essential goal.

Additionally, the rapid progress of LLMs raises concerns about the potential emergence of superintelligent systems without adequate safeguards. To effectively capitalize on LLM capacities as well as ensure their safe and beneficial development, it is critical to conduct a rigorous and comprehensive evaluation of LLMs. This survey endeavors to offer a panoramic perspective on the evaluation of LLMs. We categorize the evaluation of LLMs into three major groups: knowledge and capability evaluation, alignment evaluation and safety evaluation.

We argue that they do so by addressing three mechanizing bottlenecks in today's computing technologies: creating diverse and accessible content, learning complex digital tools, and personalizing machine learning algorithms. We adopt a case-based approach and illustrate each bottleneck with two examples where current technology imposes bottlenecks that LLMs demonstrate the ability to address.

Such concerns are exacerbated in high-stakes applications (e.g., healthcare), where unaccountable decision errors can lead to devastating consequences. In contrast, human decision-making relies on nuanced cognitive processes, such as the ability to sense and adaptively correct misjudgments through conceptual understanding. Drawing inspiration from human cognition, we propose an innovative \\textit{metacognitive} approach, dubbed \\textbf{CLEAR}, to equip LLMs with capabilities for self-aware error identification and correction. Our framework facilitates the construction of concept-specific sparse subnetworks that illuminate transparent decision pathways. This provides a novel interface for model \\textit{intervention} after deployment.

While individual instances have drawn much attention, the debate lacks a systematic overview of practical applications currently researched and ethical issues connected to them. Against this background, this work aims to map the ethical landscape surrounding the current stage of deployment of LLMs in medicine and healthcare. Electronic databases and preprint servers were queried using a comprehensive search strategy. Studies were screened and extracted following a modified rapid review approach. Methodological quality was assessed using a hybrid approach. For 53 records, a meta-aggregative synthesis was performed. Four fields of applications emerged and testify to a vivid exploration phase. Advantages of using LLMs are attributed to their capacity in data analysis, personalized information provisioning, support in decision-making, mitigating information loss and enhancing information accessibility. However, we also identifies recurrent ethical concerns connected to fairness, bias, non-maleficence, transparency, and privacy. A distinctive concern is the tendency to produce harmful misinformation or convincingly but inaccurate content. A recurrent plea for ethical guidance and human oversight is evident. Given the variety of use cases, it is suggested that the ethical guidance debate be reframed to focus on defining what constitutes acceptable human oversight across the spectrum of applications.

However, current LLMs are far from reliable: they are prone to generate non-factual information and, more crucially, to contradict themselves when prompted to reason about beliefs of the world. These problems are currently addressed with large scale fine-tuning or by delegating consistent reasoning to external tools. In this work, we strive for a middle ground and introduce a training objective based on principled probabilistic reasoning that teaches a LLM to be consistent with external knowledge in the form of a set of facts and rules. Fine-tuning with our loss on a limited set of facts enables our LLMs to be more logically consistent than previous baselines and allows them to extrapolate to unseen but semantically similar factual knowledge more systematically."}

Although many benchmarks exist, they mainly focus on specific predefined model abilities, such as world knowledge, reasoning, etc. Based on these ability scores, it is hard for users to determine which LLM best suits their particular needs. To address these issues, we propose to evaluate LLMs from a user-centric perspective and design this benchmark to measure their efficacy in satisfying user needs under distinct intents. Firstly, we collect 1,846 real-world use cases from a user study with 712 participants from 23 countries. This first-hand data helps us understand actual user intents and needs in LLM interactions, forming the User Reported Scenarios (URS) dataset, which is categorized with six types of user intents. Secondly, based on this authentic dataset, we benchmark 10 LLM services with GPT-4-as-Judge. Thirdly, we show that benchmark scores align well with human preference in both real-world experience and pair-wise annotations, achieving Pearson correlations of 0.95 and 0.94, respectively. This alignment confirms that the URS dataset and our evaluation method establish an effective user-centric benchmark.

Part of the appeal for LLMs is their approachability to the general public, including individuals with no prior technical experience in NLP techniques. However, natural language prompts can vary significantly in terms of their linguistic structure, context, and other semantics. Modifying one or more of these aspects can result in significant differences in task performance. Non-expert users may find it challenging to identify the changes needed to improve a prompt, especially when they lack domain-specific knowledge and lack appropriate feedback. To address this challenge, we present PromptAid, a visual analytics system designed to interactively create, refine, and test prompts through exploration, perturbation, testing, and iteration. PromptAid uses multiple, coordinated visualizations which allow users to improve prompts by using the three strategies: keyword perturbations, paraphrasing perturbations, and obtaining the best set of in-context few-shot examples. PromptAid was designed through an iterative prototyping process involving NLP experts and was evaluated through quantitative and qualitative assessments for LLMs. Our findings indicate that PromptAid helps users to iterate over prompt template alterations with less cognitive overhead, generate diverse prompts with help of recommendations, and analyze the performance of the generated prompts while surpassing existing state-of-the-art prompting interfaces in performance."}

LLM-based autonomous agents can interact with diverse tools (e.g., functional APIs) and generate solution plans that execute a series of API function calls in a step-by-step manner. The multitude of candidate API function calls significantly expands the action space, amplifying the critical need for efficient action space navigation. However, existing methods either struggle with unidirectional exploration in expansive action spaces, trapped into a locally optimal solution, or suffer from exhaustively traversing all potential actions, causing inefficient navigation. To address these issues, we propose ToolChain*, an efficient tree search-based planning algorithm for LLM-based agents. It formulates the entire action space as a decision tree, where each node represents a possible API function call involved in a solution plan. By incorporating the A* search algorithm with task-specific cost function design, it efficiently prunes high-cost branches that may involve incorrect actions, identifying the most low-cost valid path as the solution. Extensive experiments on multiple tool-use and reasoning tasks demonstrate that ToolChain* efficiently balances exploration and exploitation within an expansive action space. It outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on planning and reasoning tasks by 3.1% and 3.5% on average while requiring 7.35x and 2.31x less time, respectively."}

However, since LLM's content generation process is hardly controllable, current LLM-based agents frequently generate invalid or non-executable plans, which jeopardizes the performance of the generated plans and corrupts users' trust in LLM-based agents. In response, this paper proposes a novel \"Formal-LLM\" framework for LLM-based agents by integrating the expressiveness of natural language and the precision of formal language. Specifically, the framework allows agent developers to express their requirements or constraints for the planning process as an automaton. A stack-based LLM plan generation process is then conducted under the supervision of the automaton to ensure that the generated plan satisfies the constraints, making the planning process controllable. We conduct experiments on both benchmark tasks and practical real-life tasks, and our framework achieves over 50% overall performance increase, which validates the feasibility and effectiveness of employing Formal-LLM to guide the plan generation of agents, preventing the agents from generating invalid and unsuccessful plans. Further, more controllable LLM-based agents can facilitate the broader utilization of LLM in application scenarios where high validity of planning is essential.
