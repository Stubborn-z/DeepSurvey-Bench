To address this issue, in this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of existing research works on deep neural network pruning in a taxonomy of 1) universal/specific speedup, 2) when to prune, 3) how to prune, and 4) fusion of pruning and other compression techniques. We then provide a thorough comparative analysis of eight pairs of contrast settings for pruning and explore emerging topics, including pruning for large language models, large multimodal models, post-training pruning, and different supervision levels for pruning to shed light on the commonalities and differences of existing methods and lay the foundation for further method development. To facilitate future research, we build a curated collection of datasets, networks, and evaluations on different applications. Finally, we provide valuable recommendations on selecting pruning methods and prospect several promising research directions.

However, their superior performance comes at the considerable cost of computational complexity, which greatly hinders their applications in many resource-constrained devices, such as mobile phones and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Therefore, methods and techniques that are able to lift the efficiency bottleneck while preserving the high accuracy of DNNs are in great demand in order to enable numerous edge AI applications. This paper provides an overview of efficient deep learning methods, systems and applications. We start from introducing popular model compression methods, including pruning, factorization, quantization as well as compact model design. To reduce the large design cost of these manual solutions, we discuss the AutoML framework for each of them, such as neural architecture search (NAS) and automated pruning and quantization. We then cover efficient on-device training to enable user customization based on the local data on mobile devices. Apart from general acceleration techniques, we also showcase several task-specific accelerations for point cloud, video and natural language processing by exploiting their spatial sparsity and temporal/token redundancy. Finally, to support all these algorithmic advancements, we introduce the efficient deep learning system design from both software and hardware perspectives."}

To address this limitation, we introduce \"deep compression\", a three stage pipeline: pruning, trained quantization and Huffman coding, that work together to reduce the storage requirement of neural networks by 35x to 49x without affecting their accuracy. Our method first prunes the network by learning only the important connections. Next, we quantize the weights to enforce weight sharing, finally, we apply Huffman coding. After the first two steps we retrain the network to fine tune the remaining connections and the quantized centroids. Pruning, reduces the number of connections by 9x to 13x; Quantization then reduces the number of bits that represent each connection from 32 to 5. On the ImageNet dataset, our method reduced the storage required by AlexNet by 35x, from 240MB to 6.9MB, without loss of accuracy. Our method reduced the size of VGG-16 by 49x from 552MB to 11.3MB, again with no loss of accuracy. This allows fitting the model into on-chip SRAM cache rather than off-chip DRAM memory. Our compression method also facilitates the use of complex neural networks in mobile applications where application size and download bandwidth are constrained. Benchmarked on CPU, GPU and mobile GPU, compressed network has 3x to 4x layerwise speedup and 3x to 7x better energy efficiency."}

However, it can take a long time for DNNs to make an inference on resource-constrained computing devices. Model compression techniques can address the computation issue of deep inference on embedded devices. This technique is highly attractive, as it does not rely on specialized hardware, or computation-offloading that is often infeasible due to privacy concerns or high latency. However, it remains unclear how model compression techniques perform across a wide range of DNNs. To design efficient embedded deep learning solutions, we need to understand their behaviors. This work develops a quantitative approach to characterize model compression techniques on a representative embedded deep learning architecture, the NVIDIA Jetson Tx2. We perform extensive experiments by considering 11 influential neural network architectures from the image classification and the natural language processing domains. We experimentally show that how two mainstream compression techniques, data quantization and pruning, perform on these network architectures and the implications of compression techniques to the model storage size, inference time, energy consumption and performance metrics. We demonstrate that there are opportunities to achieve fast deep inference on embedded systems, but one must carefully choose the compression settings.

Recent reports (Han et al., 2015; Narang et al., 2017) prune deep networks at the cost of only a marginal loss in accuracy and achieve a sizable reduction in model size. This hints at the possibility that the baseline models in these experiments are perhaps severely over-parameterized at the outset and a viable alternative for model compression might be to simply reduce the number of hidden units while maintaining the model's dense connection structure, exposing a similar trade-off in model size and accuracy. We investigate these two distinct paths for model compression within the context of energy-efficient inference in resource-constrained environments and propose a new gradual pruning technique that is simple and straightforward to apply across a variety of models/datasets with minimal tuning and can be seamlessly incorporated within the training process. We compare the accuracy of large, but pruned models (large-sparse) and their smaller, but dense (small-dense) counterparts with identical memory footprint. Across a broad range of neural network architectures (deep CNNs, stacked LSTM, and seq2seq LSTM models), we find large-sparse models to consistently outperform small-dense models and achieve up to 10x reduction in number of non-zero parameters with minimal loss in accuracy."}

We propose Early Compression via Gradient Flow Preservation (EarlyCroP), which efficiently extracts state-of-the-art sparse models before or early in training addressing challenge (1), and can be applied in a structured manner addressing challenge (2). This enables us to train sparse networks on commodity GPUs whose dense versions would be too large, thereby saving costs and reducing hardware requirements. We empirically show that EarlyCroP outperforms a rich set of baselines for many tasks (incl. classification, regression) and domains (incl. computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcment learning). EarlyCroP leads to accuracy comparable to dense training while outperforming pruning baselines."}

However, the size of AI models has been rapidly growing due to scaling laws and the success of foundational models, which poses an increasing challenge to leverage advanced models in practical applications. It is thus imperative to develop efficient models, especially for deploying AI solutions under resource-constrains or with time sensitivity. One potential solution is to perform model compression, a set of techniques that remove less important model components or reduce parameter precision, to reduce model computation demand. In this work, we demonstrate that model pruning, as a model compression technique, can effectively reduce inference cost for computational and digital pathology based analysis with a negligible loss of analysis performance. To this end, we develop a methodology for pruning the widely used U-Net-style architectures in biomedical imaging, with which we evaluate multiple pruning heuristics on nuclei instance segmentation and classification, and empirically demonstrate that pruning can compress models by at least 70% with a negligible drop in performance."}

Concretely, given a global compression ratio, we categorize all the parameters into two parts at each training iteration which are updated using different rules. In this way, we gradually zero out the redundant parameters, as we update them using only the ordinary weight decay but no gradients derived from the objective function. As a departure from prior methods that require heavy human works to tune the layer-wise sparsity ratios, prune by solving complicated non-differentiable problems or finetune the model after pruning, our method is characterized by 1) global compression that automatically finds the appropriate per-layer sparsity ratios; 2) end-to-end training; 3) no need for a time-consuming re-training process after pruning; and 4) superior capability to find better winning tickets which have won the initialization lottery."}

There are currently two mainstreams of pruning methods representing two extremes of pruning regularity: non-structured, fine-grained pruning can achieve high sparsity and accuracy, but is not hardware friendly; structured, coarse-grained pruning exploits hardware-efficient structures in pruning, but suffers from accuracy drop when the pruning rate is high. In this paper, we introduce PCONV, comprising a new sparsity dimension, -- fine-grained pruning patterns inside the coarse-grained structures. PCONV comprises two types of sparsities, Sparse Convolution Patterns (SCP) which is generated from intra-convolution kernel pruning and connectivity sparsity generated from inter-convolution kernel pruning. Essentially, SCP enhances accuracy due to its special vision properties, and connectivity sparsity increases pruning rate while maintaining balanced workload on filter computation. To deploy PCONV, we develop a novel compiler-assisted DNN inference framework and execute PCONV models in real-time without accuracy compromise, which cannot be achieved in prior work. Our experimental results show that, PCONV outperforms three state-of-art end-to-end DNN frameworks, TensorFlow-Lite, TVM, and Alibaba Mobile Neural Network with speedup up to 39.2x, 11.4x, and 6.3x, respectively, with no accuracy loss.

Neural network pruning, as one of the mainstream model compression techniques, is under extensive study to reduce the number of parameters and computations. In contrast to irregular pruning that incurs high index storage and decoding overhead, structured pruning techniques have been proposed as the promising solutions. However, prior studies on structured pruning tackle the problem mainly from the perspective of facilitating hardware implementation, without analyzing the characteristics of sparse neural networks. The neglect on the study of sparse neural networks causes inefficient trade-off between regularity and pruning ratio. Consequently, the potential of structurally pruning neural networks is not sufficiently mined. In this work, we examine the structural characteristics of the irregularly pruned weight matrices, such as the diverse redundancy of different rows, the sensitivity of different rows to pruning, and the positional characteristics of retained weights. By leveraging the gained insights as a guidance, we first propose the novel block-max weight masking (BMWM) method, which can effectively retain the salient weights while imposing high regularity to the weight matrix. As a further optimization, we propose a density-adaptive regular-block (DARB) pruning that outperforms prior structured pruning work with high pruning ratio and decoding efficiency. Our experimental results show that DARB can achieve 13$\\times$ to 25$\\times$ pruning ratio, which are 2.8$\\times$ to 4.3$\\times$ improvements than the state-of-the-art counterparts on multiple neural network models and tasks.

With the flexibility of applying different pruning schemes to different layers enabled by our compiler optimizations, we further probe into the new problem of determining the best-suited pruning scheme considering the different acceleration and accuracy performance of various pruning schemes. Two pruning scheme mapping methods, one is search-based and the other is rule-based, are proposed to automatically derive the best-suited pruning regularity and block size for each layer of any given DNN.

Model compression became a central research topic, as it is crucial for deployment of neural networks on devices with limited computational and memory resources. The majority of the compression methods are based on heuristics and offer no worst-case guarantees on the trade-off between the compression rate and the approximation error for an arbitrarily new sample. We propose the first efficient, data-independent neural pruning algorithm with a provable trade-off between its compression rate and the approximation error for any future test sample. Our method is based on the coreset framework, which finds a small weighted subset of points that provably approximates the original inputs. Specifically, we approximate the output of a layer of neurons by a coreset of neurons in the previous layer and discard the rest. We apply this framework in a layer-by-layer fashion from the top to the bottom. Unlike previous works, our coreset is data independent, meaning that it provably guarantees the accuracy of the function for any input $x\\in \\mathbb{R}^d$, including an adversarial one. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on popular network architectures.

Our study bridges this gap, seeking to understand the effect of adversarial inputs crafted for base models on their pruned versions. To examine this relationship, we have developed a comprehensive benchmark across diverse adversarial attacks and popular DNN models. We uniquely focus on models not previously exposed to adversarial training and apply pruning schemes optimized for accuracy and performance. Our findings reveal that while the benefits of pruning enhanced generalizability, compression, and faster inference times are preserved, adversarial robustness remains comparable to the base model.

To identify the optimal sequence for compressing neural networks, we propose the Order of Compression, a systematic and optimal sequence to apply multiple compression techniques in the most effective order. We start by building the foundations of the orders between any two compression approaches and then demonstrate inserting additional compression between any two compressions will not break the order of the two compression approaches. Based on the foundations, an optimal order is obtained with topological sorting. Validated on image-based regression and classification networks across different datasets, our proposed Order of Compression significantly reduces computational costs by up to 859 times on ResNet34, with negligible accuracy loss (-0.09% for CIFAR10) compared to the baseline model.

However, a slow retraining or fine-tuning procedure is often required to recover the accuracy loss caused by pruning. Recently, a new research direction on weight pruning, pruning-at-initialization (PAI), is proposed to directly prune CNNs before training so that fine-tuning or retraining can be avoided. While PAI has shown promising results in reducing the model size, existing approaches rely on fine-grained weight pruning which requires unstructured sparse matrix computation, making it difficult to achieve real speedup in practice unless the sparsity is very high. This work is the first to show that fine-grained weight pruning is in fact not necessary for PAI. Instead, the layerwise compression ratio is the main critical factor to determine the accuracy of a CNN model pruned at initialization. Based on this key observation, we propose PreCropping, a structured hardware-efficient model compression scheme. PreCropping directly compresses the model at the channel level following the layerwise compression ratio. Compared to weight pruning, the proposed scheme is regular and dense in both storage and computation without sacrificing accuracy. In addition, since PreCropping compresses CNNs at initialization, the computational and memory costs of CNNs are reduced for both training and inference on commodity hardware. We empirically demonstrate our approaches on several modern CNN architectures, including ResNet, ShuffleNet, and MobileNet for both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet."}

To combat this, one of the most effective compression techniques -- channel pruning -- removes channels from weights. However, for multi-branch segments of a model, channel removal can introduce inference-time memory copies. In turn, these copies increase inference latency -- so much so that the pruned model can be slower than the unpruned model. As a workaround, pruners conventionally constrain certain channels to be pruned together. This fully eliminates memory copies but, as we show, significantly impairs accuracy. We now have a dilemma: Remove constraints but increase latency, or add constraints and impair accuracy. In response, our insight is to reorder channels at export time, (1) reducing latency by reducing memory copies and (2) improving accuracy by removing constraints. Using this insight, we design a generic algorithm UPSCALE to prune models with any pruning pattern. By removing constraints from existing pruners, we improve ImageNet accuracy for post-training pruned models by 2.1 points on average -- benefiting DenseNet (+16.9), EfficientNetV2 (+7.9), and ResNet (+6.2). Furthermore, by reordering channels, UPSCALE improves inference speeds by up to 2x over a baseline export."}

Techniques developed for this study have potential applications across many other domains. We study various configurations of pruning during quantization-aware training, which we term quantization-aware pruning, and the effect of techniques like regularization, batch normalization, and different pruning schemes on performance, computational complexity, and information content metrics. We find that quantization-aware pruning yields more computationally efficient models than either pruning or quantization alone for our task. Further, quantization-aware pruning typically performs similar to or better in terms of computational efficiency compared to other neural architecture search techniques like Bayesian optimization.

Two techniques widely employed in the efficient deployment of DNNs -- the quantization and pruning of parameters, can both compress the model size, reduce memory footprints, and facilitate low-latency execution. The interaction between quantization and pruning and how they might impact model performance on SNN accelerators is currently unknown. We study various combinations of pruning and quantization in isolation, cumulatively, and simultaneously (jointly) to a state-of-the-art SNN targeting gesture recognition for dynamic vision sensor cameras (DVS). We show that this state-of-the-art model is amenable to aggressive parameter quantization, not suffering from any loss in accuracy down to ternary weights. However, pruning only maintains iso-accuracy up to 80% sparsity, which results in 45% more energy than the best quantization on our architectural model.

To address these challenges, we propose FedTiny, a distributed pruning framework for federated learning that generates specialized tiny models for memory- and computing-constrained devices. We introduce two key modules in FedTiny to adaptively search coarse- and finer-pruned specialized models to fit deployment scenarios with sparse and cheap local computation. First, an adaptive batch normalization selection module is designed to mitigate biases in pruning caused by the heterogeneity of local data. Second, a lightweight progressive pruning module aims to finer prune the models under strict memory and computational budgets, allowing the pruning policy for each layer to be gradually determined rather than evaluating the overall model structure.

A typical pruning algorithm is a three-stage pipeline, i.e., training (a large model), pruning and fine-tuning. During pruning, according to a certain criterion, redundant weights are pruned and important weights are kept to best preserve the accuracy. In this work, we make several surprising observations which contradict common beliefs. For all state-of-the-art structured pruning algorithms we examined, fine-tuning a pruned model only gives comparable or worse performance than training that model with randomly initialized weights. For pruning algorithms which assume a predefined target network architecture, one can get rid of the full pipeline and directly train the target network from scratch. Our observations are consistent for multiple network architectures, datasets, and tasks, which imply that: 1) training a large, over-parameterized model is often not necessary to obtain an efficient final model, 2) learned \"important\" weights of the large model are typically not useful for the small pruned model, 3) the pruned architecture itself, rather than a set of inherited \"important\" weights, is more crucial to the efficiency in the final model, which suggests that in some cases pruning can be useful as an architecture search paradigm. Our results suggest the need for more careful baseline evaluations in future research on structured pruning methods. We also compare with the \"Lottery Ticket Hypothesis\" (Frankle & Carbin 2019), and find that with optimal learning rate, the \"winning ticket\" initialization as used in Frankle & Carbin (2019) does not bring improvement over random initialization."}

A long-standing hypothesis based on bias-variance trade-off attributes this generalization improvement to model size reduction. However, recent studies on over-parameterization characterize a new model size regime, in which larger models achieve better generalization. Pruning models in this over-parameterized regime leads to a contradiction -- while theory predicts that reducing model size harms generalization, pruning to a range of sparsities nonetheless improves it. Motivated by this contradiction, we re-examine pruning's effect on generalization empirically. We show that size reduction cannot fully account for the generalization-improving effect of standard pruning algorithms. Instead, we find that pruning leads to better training at specific sparsities, improving the training loss over the dense model. We find that pruning also leads to additional regularization at other sparsities, reducing the accuracy degradation due to noisy examples over the dense model. Pruning extends model training time and reduces model size. These two factors improve training and add regularization respectively. We empirically demonstrate that both factors are essential to fully explaining pruning's impact on generalization."}

However, studies have shown the potential of pruning as a form of regularization, which reduces overfitting and improves generalization. We demonstrate that this family of strategies provides additional benefits beyond computational performance and generalization. Our analyses reveal that pruning structures (filters and/or layers) from convolutional networks increase not only generalization but also robustness to adversarial images (natural images with content modified). Such achievements are possible since pruning reduces network capacity and provides regularization, which have been proven effective tools against adversarial images. In contrast to promising defense mechanisms that require training with adversarial images and careful regularization, we show that pruning obtains competitive results considering only natural images (e.g., the standard and low-cost training). We confirm these findings on several adversarial attacks and architectures; thus suggesting the potential of pruning as a novel defense mechanism against adversarial images."}

Pruning can reduce the parameter-counts of many state-of-the-art neural networks by an order of magnitude without compromising accuracy, meaning these networks contain a vast amount of unnecessary structure. In this paper, we study the relationship between pruning and interpretability. Namely, we consider the effect of removing unnecessary structure on the number of hidden units that learn disentangled representations of human-recognizable concepts as identified by network dissection. We aim to evaluate how the interpretability of pruned neural networks changes as they are compressed. We find that pruning has no detrimental effect on this measure of interpretability until so few parameters remain that accuracy beings to drop. Resnet-50 models trained on ImageNet maintain the same number of interpretable concepts and units until more than 90% of parameters have been pruned."}

In particular, channel pruning gained more popularity due to its structured nature and direct savings on general hardware. However, most existing pruning approaches utilize importance measures that are not directly related to the task utility. Moreover, few in the literature focus on visual detection models. To fill these gaps, we propose a novel gradient-based saliency measure for visual detection and use it to guide our channel pruning. Experiments on the KITTI and COCO traffic datasets demonstrate our pruning method's efficacy and superiority over state-of-the-art competing approaches. It can even achieve better performance with fewer parameters than the original model. Our pruning also demonstrates great potential in handling small-scale objects."}

Unfortunately, special hardware requirements and limited study on its effectiveness on already compact models prevent its wider adoption. Depth pruning is a form of pruning that requires no specialized hardware but suffers from a large accuracy falloff. To improve this, we propose a modification that utilizes a highly efficient auxiliary network as an effective interpreter of intermediate feature maps. Our results show a parameter reduction of 93% on the MLPerfTiny Visual Wakewords (VWW) task and 28% on the Keyword Spotting (KWS) task with accuracy cost of 0.65% and 1.06% respectively. When evaluated on a Cortex-M0 microcontroller, our proposed method reduces the VWW model size by 4.7x and latency by 1.6x while counter intuitively gaining 1% accuracy.

However, current pruning algorithms either only focus on one pruning category, e.g., structured pruning and unstructured, or need extensive hyperparameter tuning in order to get reasonable accuracy performance. To address these challenges, we propose LEArnable Pruning (LEAP), an effective method to gradually prune the model based on thresholds learned by gradient descent. Different than previous learnable pruning methods, which utilize $L_0$ or $L_1$ penalty to indirectly affect the final pruning ratio, LEAP introduces a novel regularization function, that directly interacts with the preset target pruning ratio. Moreover, in order to reduce hyperparameter tuning, a novel adaptive regularization coefficient is deployed to control the regularization penalty adaptively. With the new regularization term and its associated adaptive regularization coefficient, LEAP is able to be applied for different pruning granularity, including unstructured pruning, structured pruning, and hybrid pruning, with minimal hyperparameter tuning. We apply LEAP for BERT models on QQP/MNLI/SQuAD for different pruning settings. Our result shows that for all datasets, pruning granularity, and pruning ratios, LEAP achieves on-par or better results as compared to previous heavily hand-tuned methods."}

To address these challenges, this paper investigates the application of weight pruning-a strategic reduction of model parameters based on their significance-as an optimization strategy for Transformer architectures. Through extensive experimentation, we explore various pruning methodologies, highlighting their impact on model performance, size, and computational demands. Our findings suggest that with judicious selection of pruning hyperparameters, significant reductions in model size are attainable without considerable compromise on performance. Moreover, when coupled with post-pruning fine-tuning strategies, some pruned models even exhibit enhanced generalization capabilities.

The two predominant approaches are Adapters and Pruning. Adapters are to freeze the model and give it a new weight matrix on the side, which can significantly reduce the time and memory of training, but the cost is that the evaluation and testing will increase the time and memory consumption. Pruning is to cut off some weight and re-distribute the remaining weight, which sacrifices the complexity of training at the cost of extremely high memory and training time, making the cost of evaluation and testing relatively low. So efficiency of training and inference can't be obtained in the same time. In this work, we propose a task-oriented Pruning-Adapter method that achieve a high memory efficiency of training and memory, and speeds up training time and ensures no significant decrease in accuracy in GLUE tasks, achieving training and inference efficiency at the same time."}

The performance of sparse kernels varies greatly depending on the structure of the input matrix, making it difficult to gain a comprehensive understanding of sparse computation and its relationship to inputs, algorithms, and target machine architecture. Despite extensive research on certain sparse kernels, such as Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV), the overall family of sparse algorithms has yet to be investigated as a whole. This paper introduces SpChar, a workload characterization methodology for general sparse computation. SpChar employs tree-based models to identify the most relevant hardware and input characteristics, starting from hardware and input-related metrics gathered from Performance Monitoring Counters (PMCs) and matrices. Our analysis enables the creation of a characterization loop that facilitates the optimization of sparse computation by mapping the impact of architectural features to inputs and algorithmic choices. We apply SpChar to more than 600 matrices from the SuiteSparse Matrix collection and three state-of-the-art Arm CPUs to determine the critical hardware and software characteristics that affect sparse computation. In our analysis, we determine that the biggest limiting factors for high-performance sparse computation are (1) the latency of the memory system, (2) the pipeline flush overhead resulting from branch misprediction, and (3) the poor reuse of cached elements. Additionally, we propose software and hardware optimizations that designers can implement to create a platform suitable for sparse computation. We then investigate these optimizations using the gem5 simulator to achieve a significant speedup of up to 2.63x compared to a CPU where the optimizations are not applied."}

Meanwhile, systolic array has been increasingly competitive on CNNs acceleration for its high spatiotemporal locality and low hardware overhead. However, the irregularity of sparsity induces imbalanced workload under the rigid systolic dataflow, causing performance degradation. Thus, this paper proposed a systolicarray-based architecture, called Sense, for sparse CNN acceleration by model-hardware co-design, achieving large performance improvement. To balance input feature map(IFM) and weight loads across Processing Element(PE) array, we applied channel clustering to gather IFMs with approximate sparsity for array computation, and co-designed a load-balancing weight pruning method to keep the sparsity ratio of each kernel at a certain value with little accuracy loss, improving PE utilization and overall performance. Additionally, Adaptive Dataflow Configuration is applied to determine the computing strategy based on the storage ratio of IFMs and weights, lowering 1.17x-1.8x DRAM access compared with Swallow and further reducing system energy consumption. The whole design is implemented on ZynqZCU102 with 200MHz and performs at 471-, 34-, 53- and 191-image/s for AlexNet, VGG-16, ResNet-50 and GoogleNet respectively.

As models get larger, these demands are only increasing. Sparsity is a promising technique to relieve the compute requirements for training. However, sparsity introduces new challenges in training the sparse model to the same quality as the dense counterparts. Furthermore, sparsity drops the operation intensity and introduces irregular memory access patterns that makes it challenging to efficiently utilize compute resources. This paper demonstrates an end-to-end training flow on a large language model - 13 billion GPT - using sparsity and dataflow. The dataflow execution model and architecture enables efficient on-chip irregular memory accesses as well as native kernel fusion and pipelined parallelism that helps recover device utilization.

The primary challenge with sparse matrices has been efficiently storing and transferring data, for which many sparse formats have been proposed to significantly eliminate zero entries. Such formats, essentially designed to optimize memory footprint, may not be as successful in performing faster processing. In other words, although they allow faster data transfer and improve memory bandwidth utilization -- the classic challenge of sparse problems -- their decompression mechanism can potentially create a computation bottleneck. Not only is this challenge not resolved, but also it becomes more serious with the advent of domain-specific architectures (DSAs), as they intend to more aggressively improve performance. The performance implications of using various formats along with DSAs, however, has not been extensively studied by prior work. To fill this gap of knowledge, we characterize the impact of using seven frequently used sparse formats on performance, based on a DSA for sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV), implemented on an FPGA using high-level synthesis (HLS) tools, a growing and popular method for developing DSAs. Seeking a fair comparison, we tailor and optimize the HLS implementation of decompression for each format. We thoroughly explore diverse metrics, including decompression overhead, latency, balance ratio, throughput, memory bandwidth utilization, resource utilization, and power consumption, on a variety of real-world and synthetic sparse workloads."}

A Comparative Study of Large Language Models for Taxonomy Construction", "abstract": "Taxonomies represent hierarchical relations between entities, frequently applied in various software modeling and natural language processing (NLP) activities. They are typically subject to a set of structural constraints restricting their content. However, manual taxonomy construction can be time-consuming, incomplete, and costly to maintain. Recent studies of large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that appropriate user inputs (called prompting) can effectively guide LLMs, such as GPT-3, in diverse NLP tasks without explicit (re-)training. However, existing approaches for automated taxonomy construction typically involve fine-tuning a language model by adjusting model parameters. In this paper, we present a general framework for taxonomy construction that takes into account structural constraints. We subsequently conduct a systematic comparison between the prompting and fine-tuning approaches performed on a hypernym taxonomy and a novel computer science taxonomy dataset. Our result reveals the following: (1) Even without explicit training on the dataset, the prompting approach outperforms fine-tuning-based approaches. Moreover, the performance gap between prompting and fine-tuning widens when the training dataset is small. However, (2) taxonomies generated by the fine-tuning approach can be easily post-processed to satisfy all the constraints, whereas handling violations of the taxonomies produced by the prompting approach can be challenging.

We show that research involving both modes features a 16% citation premium relative to a mono-disciplinary baseline. Further comparison of research integrating neighboring versus distant research domains shows that the cross-disciplinary mode is essential for integrating across relatively large disciplinary distances. Yet we find research utilizing cross-domain subject area exploration alone - a convergence shortcut - to be growing in prevalence at roughly 3% per year, significantly faster than the alternative cross-disciplinary mode, despite being less effective at integrating domains and markedly less impactful. By measuring shifts in the prevalence and impact of different convergence modes in the 5-year intervals before and after 2013, our results indicate that these counterproductive patterns may relate to competitive pressures associated with global Human Brain flagship funding initiatives.

Both metrics can be evaluated very efficiently during pruning, allowing us to reformulate global structural pruning under a reward maximization problem given target constraint. This makes the problem solvable via our augmented knapsack solver, enabling HALP to surpass prior work in pruning efficacy and accuracy-efficiency trade-off. We examine HALP on both classification and detection tasks, over varying networks, on ImageNet and VOC datasets. In particular, for ResNet-50/-101 pruning on ImageNet, HALP improves network throughput by $1.60\\times$/$1.90\\times$ with $+0.3\\%$/$-0.2\\%$ top-1 accuracy changes, respectively.

It analyzes these factors in detail, providing both theoretical and empirical support, and proposes a simple, yet effective, solution that mitigates the disparate impacts caused by pruning."}

Yet, uninformed engineering decisions in early-stage research inadvertently hinder the feasibility of such solutions for high-throughput, on-device inference, particularly in settings involving legacy hardware and multi-modal gigapixel images. Through a preliminary case study concerning segmentation in cardiology, we highlight the excess operational complexity in a suboptimally configured ML model from prior work and demonstrate that it can be sculpted away using pruning to meet deployment criteria. Our results show a compression rate of 1148x with minimal loss in quality (~4%) and, at higher rates, achieve faster inference on a CPU than the GPU baseline, stressing the need to consider task complexity and architectural details when using off-the-shelf models. With this, we consider avenues for future research in streamlining workflows for clinical researchers to develop models quicker and better suited for real-world use."}

However, the nuanced ways in which pruning impacts model behavior are not well understood, particularly for long-tailed, multi-label datasets commonly found in clinical settings. This knowledge gap could have dangerous implications when deploying a pruned model for diagnosis, where unexpected model behavior could impact patient well-being. To fill this gap, we perform the first analysis of pruning's effect on neural networks trained to diagnose thorax diseases from chest X-rays (CXRs). On two large CXR datasets, we examine which diseases are most affected by pruning and characterize class \"forgettability\" based on disease frequency and co-occurrence behavior. Further, we identify individual CXRs where uncompressed and heavily pruned models disagree, known as pruning-identified exemplars (PIEs), and conduct a human reader study to evaluate their unifying qualities. We find that radiologists perceive PIEs as having more label noise, lower image quality, and higher diagnosis difficulty. This work represents a first step toward understanding the impact of pruning on model behavior in deep long-tailed, multi-label medical image classification. All code, model weights, and data access instructions can be found at https://github.com/VITA-Group/PruneCXR."}

Real-time inference speed remains a key requirement for such applications to help medical personnel. Even though there generally exists a trade-off between performance and model size, impressive efforts have been made to retain near-original performance by compromising model size. Neural network pruning has emerged as an exciting area that aims to eliminate redundant parameters to make the inference faster. In this study, we show an application of neural network pruning in polyp segmentation. We compute the importance score of convolutional filters and remove the filters having the least scores, which to some value of pruning does not degrade the performance. For computing the importance score, we use the Taylor First Order (TaylorFO) approximation of the change in network output for the removal of certain filters. Specifically, we employ a gradient-normalized backpropagation for the computation of the importance score. Through experiments in the polyp datasets, we validate that our approach can significantly reduce the parameter count and FLOPs retaining similar performance."}

However, DNNs cannot be easily run on devices due to their substantial computing, memory and energy requirements for delivering performance that is comparable to cloud-based ML. Therefore, model compression techniques, such as pruning, have been considered. Existing pruning methods are problematic for edge ML since they: (1) Create compressed models that have limited runtime performance benefits (using unstructured pruning) or compromise the final model accuracy (using structured pruning), and (2) Require substantial compute resources and time for identifying a suitable compressed DNN model (using neural architecture search). In this paper, we explore a new avenue, referred to as Pruning-at-Initialization (PaI), using structured pruning to mitigate the above problems. We develop Reconvene, a system for rapidly generating pruned models suited for edge deployments using structured PaI. Reconvene systematically identifies and prunes DNN convolution layers that are least sensitive to structured pruning. Reconvene rapidly creates pruned DNNs within seconds that are up to 16.21x smaller and 2x faster while maintaining the same accuracy as an unstructured PaI counterpart."}

Network compression methodologies such as weight pruning, filter pruning, and quantization are used to overcome the above mentioned problem. Even though filter pruning methodology has shown better performances compared to other techniques, irregularity of the number of filters pruned across different layers of a CNN might not comply with majority of the neural computing hardware architectures. In this paper, a novel greedy approach called cluster pruning has been proposed, which provides a structured way of removing filters in a CNN by considering the importance of filters and the underlying hardware architecture. The proposed methodology is compared with the conventional filter pruning algorithm on Pascal-VOC open dataset, and Head-Counting dataset, which is our own dataset developed to detect and count people entering a room. We benchmark our proposed method on three hardware architectures, namely CPU, GPU, and Intel Movidius Neural Computer Stick (NCS) using the popular SSD-MobileNet and SSD-SqueezeNet neural network architectures used for edge-AI vision applications. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms the conventional filter pruning methodology, using both datasets on above mentioned hardware architectures.

Edge computing promises to exploit these underlying computation resources closer to users to help run latency-sensitive applications such as augmented reality and video analytics. However, one key missing piece has been how to incorporate personally owned unmanaged devices into a usable edge computing system. The primary challenges arise due to the heterogeneity, lack of interference management, and unpredictable availability of such devices. In this paper we propose an orchestration framework IBDASH, which orchestrates application tasks on an edge system that comprises a mix of commercial and personal edge devices. IBDASH targets reducing both end-to-end latency of execution and probability of failure for applications that have dependency among tasks, captured by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). IBDASH takes memory constraints of each edge device and network bandwidth into consideration. To assess the effectiveness of IBDASH, we run real application tasks on real edge devices with widely varying capabilities.We feed these measurements into a simulator that runs IBDASH at scale. Compared to three state-of-the-art edge orchestration schemes, LAVEA, Petrel, and LaTS, and two intuitive baselines, IBDASH reduces the end-to-end latency and probability of failure, by 14% and 41% on average respectively. The main takeaway from our work is that it is feasible to combine personal and commercial devices into a usable edge computing platform, one that delivers low latency and predictable and high availability."}

While a number of neural network pruning methods have been proposed to compress the models, prevailing approaches focus only on parametric operators (e.g., convolution), which may miss optimization opportunities. In this paper, we present a novel fusion-catalyzed pruning approach, called FuPruner, which simultaneously optimizes the parametric and non-parametric operators for accelerating neural networks. We introduce an aggressive fusion method to equivalently transform a model, which extends the optimization space of pruning and enables non-parametric operators to be pruned in a similar manner as parametric operators, and a dynamic filter pruning method is applied to decrease the computational cost of models while retaining the accuracy requirement. Moreover, FuPruner provides configurable optimization options for controlling fusion and pruning, allowing much more flexible performance-accuracy trade-offs to be made. Evaluation with state-of-the-art residual neural networks on five representative intelligent edge platforms, Jetson TX2, Jetson Nano, Edge TPU, NCS, and NCS2, demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, which can accelerate the inference of models on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets."}

They typically use the pruning technique to reduce the size and complexity of the model, generating a lighter one with less resource consumption. Nonetheless, most existing pruning methods are proposed with the premise that the model after being pruned has a chance to be fine-tuned or even retrained based on the original training data. This may be unrealistic in practice, as the data controllers are often reluctant to provide their model consumers with the original data. In this work, we study the neural network pruning in the data-free context, aiming to yield lightweight models that are not only accurate in prediction but also robust against undesired inputs in open-world deployments. Considering the absence of the fine-tuning and retraining that can fix the mis-pruned units, we replace the traditional aggressive one-shot strategy with a conservative one that treats the pruning as a progressive process. We propose a pruning method based on stochastic optimization that uses robustness-related metrics to guide the pruning process. Our method is implemented as a Python program and evaluated with a series of experiments on diverse neural network models. The experimental results show that it significantly outperforms existing one-shot data-free pruning approaches in terms of robustness preservation and accuracy."}

However, existing structured-pruning methods often result in significant accuracy degradation for moderate pruning levels. To address this problem, we introduce a new Hessian Aware Pruning (HAP) method coupled with a Neural Implant approach that uses second-order sensitivity as a metric for structured pruning. The basic idea is to prune insensitive components and to use a Neural Implant for moderately sensitive components, instead of completely pruning them. For the latter approach, the moderately sensitive components are replaced with with a low rank implant that is smaller and less computationally expensive than the original component. We use the relative Hessian trace to measure sensitivity, as opposed to the magnitude based sensitivity metric commonly used in the literature. We test HAP for both computer vision tasks and natural language tasks, and we achieve new state-of-the-art results. Specifically, HAP achieves less than $0.1\\%$/$0.5\\%$ degradation on PreResNet29/ResNet50 (CIFAR-10/ImageNet) with more than 70\\%/50\\% of parameters pruned.

Network pruning offers a solution to reduce model size and computational cost while maintaining performance. However, most current pruning methods focus primarily on improving sparsity by reducing the number of nonzero parameters, often neglecting other deployment costs such as inference time, which are closely related to the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs). In this paper, we propose FALCON, a novel combinatorial-optimization-based framework for network pruning that jointly takes into account model accuracy (fidelity), FLOPs, and sparsity constraints. A main building block of our approach is an integer linear program (ILP) that simultaneously handles FLOP and sparsity constraints. We present a novel algorithm to approximately solve the ILP. We propose a novel first-order method for our optimization framework which makes use of our ILP solver. Using problem structure (e.g., the low-rank structure of approx. Hessian), we can address instances with millions of parameters. Our experiments demonstrate that FALCON achieves superior accuracy compared to other pruning approaches within a fixed FLOP budget. For instance, for ResNet50 with 20% of the total FLOPs retained, our approach improves the accuracy by 48% relative to state-of-the-art. Furthermore, in gradual pruning settings with re-training between pruning steps, our framework outperforms existing pruning methods, emphasizing the significance of incorporating both FLOP and sparsity constraints for effective network pruning."}

It aims to automatically generate summary with important information based on a given context, which is important when you have to deal with piles of documents. Summarization techniques can help capture key points in a short time and bring convenience in works. One of applicable situation is meeting summarization, especially for important meeting that tend to be long, complicated, multi-topic and multi-person. Therefore, when people want to review specific content from a meeting, it will be hard and time-consuming to find the related spans in the meeting transcript. However, most of previous works focus on doing summarization for newsletters, scientific articles...etc, which have a clear document structure and an official format.

This proposed compression method finds a particular fine-grained pruning mask that can be decomposed into two binary matrices.

However, most successful DNNs have an extremely complex structure, leading to extensive research on model compression.As a significant area of progress in model compression, traditional gradual pruning approaches involve an iterative prune-retrain procedure and may suffer from two critical issues: local importance judgment, where the pruned weights are merely unimportant in the current model; and an irretrievable pruning process, where the pruned weights have no chance to come back. Addressing these two issues, this paper proposes the Drop Pruning approach, which leverages stochastic optimization in the pruning process by introducing a drop strategy at each pruning step, namely, drop away, which stochastically deletes some unimportant weights, and drop back, which stochastically recovers some pruned weights. The suitable choice of drop probabilities decreases the model size during the pruning process and helps it flow to the target sparsity. Compared to the Bayesian approaches that stochastically train a compact model for pruning, we directly aim at stochastic gradual pruning. We provide a detailed analysis showing that the drop away and drop back approaches have individual contributions. Moreover, Drop Pruning can achieve competitive compression performance and accuracy on many benchmark tasks compared with state-of-the-art weights pruning and Bayesian training approaches."}

In this paper, we introduce a new compression framework which covers both weight pruning and quantization in a unified setting, is time- and space-efficient, and considerably improves upon the practical performance of existing post-training methods. At the technical level, our approach is based on an exact and efficient realization of the classical Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) framework of [LeCun, Denker, and Solla, 1990] extended to also cover weight quantization at the scale of modern DNNs.

In this work, we propose a model compression method based on a novel weight permutation scheme to fully exploit the fine-grained weight sparsity in the hardware design. Through permutation, the optimal arrangement of the weight matrix is obtained, and the sparse weight matrix is further compressed to a small and dense format to make full use of the hardware resources. Two pruning granularities are explored. In addition to the unstructured weight pruning, we also propose a more fine-grained subword-level pruning to further improve the compression performance.

Simple yet effective methods like magnitude pruning remove less important parameters and typically require a costly retraining procedure to restore performance. However, with the rise of LLMs, full retraining has become infeasible due to memory and compute constraints. This study challenges the practice of retraining all parameters by showing that updating a small subset of highly expressive parameters can suffice to recover or even enhance performance after pruning. Surprisingly, retraining just 0.01%-0.05% of the parameters in GPT-architectures can match the performance of full retraining across various sparsity levels, significantly reducing compute and memory requirements, and enabling retraining of models with up to 30 billion parameters on a single GPU in minutes. To bridge the gap to full retraining in the high sparsity regime, we introduce two novel LoRA variants that, unlike standard LoRA, allow merging adapters back without compromising sparsity. Going a step further, we show that these methods can be applied for memory-efficient layer-wise reconstruction, significantly enhancing state-of-the-art retraining-free methods like Wanda (Sun et al., 2023) and SparseGPT (Frantar & Alistarh, 2023). Our findings present a promising alternative to avoiding retraining."}

Taking advantage of sparsity is listed as a high priority in next generation DNN accelerators such as TPU. The structure of sparsity, i.e., the granularity of pruning, affects the efficiency of hardware accelerator design as well as the prediction accuracy. Coarse-grained pruning creates regular sparsity patterns, making it more amenable for hardware acceleration but more challenging to maintain the same accuracy. In this paper we quantitatively measure the trade-off between sparsity regularity and prediction accuracy, providing insights in how to maintain accuracy while having more a more structured sparsity pattern. Our experimental results show that coarse-grained pruning can achieve a sparsity ratio similar to unstructured pruning without loss of accuracy. Moreover, due to the index saving effect, coarse-grained pruning is able to obtain a better compression ratio than fine-grained sparsity at the same accuracy threshold. Based on the recent sparse convolutional neural network accelerator (SCNN), our experiments further demonstrate that coarse-grained sparsity saves about 2x the memory references compared to fine-grained sparsity. Since memory reference is more than two orders of magnitude more expensive than arithmetic operations, the regularity of sparse structure leads to more efficient hardware design."}

Pruning is an effective technique that reduces both memory and compute demand for model inference. However, pruning for online recommendation systems is challenging due to the continuous data distribution shift (a.k.a non-stationary data). Although incremental training on the full model is able to adapt to the non-stationary data, directly applying it on the pruned model leads to accuracy loss. This is because the sparsity pattern after pruning requires adjustment to learn new patterns. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide in-depth analysis and discussion of applying pruning to online recommendation systems with non-stationary data distribution. Overall, this work makes the following contributions: 1) We present an adaptive dense to sparse paradigm equipped with a novel pruning algorithm for pruning a large scale recommendation system with non-stationary data distribution; 2) We design the pruning algorithm to automatically learn the sparsity across layers to avoid repeating hand-tuning, which is critical for pruning the heterogeneous architectures of recommendation systems trained with non-stationary data."}

This paper presents two compatible contributions towards reducing the time, energy, computational, and storage complexities associated with multilayer perceptrons. Pre-defined sparsity is proposed to reduce the complexity during both training and inference, regardless of the implementation platform. Our results show that storage and computational complexity can be reduced by factors greater than 5X without significant performance loss. The second contribution is an architecture for hardware acceleration that is compatible with pre-defined sparsity. This architecture supports both training and inference modes and is flexible in the sense that it is not tied to a specific number of neurons. For example, this flexibility implies that various sized neural networks can be supported on various sized Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)s."}

And the degree of sparsity one can exploit has become higher as larger model sizes have been considered along with the trend of pre-training giant models. On the other hand, compared with quantization that has been a widely supported option, acceleration through high-degree sparsity is not supported in most computing platforms. In this work, we introduce the first commercial hardware platform supporting high-degree sparsity acceleration up to 32 times -- S4. Combined with state-of-the-art sparse pruning techniques, we demonstrate several-times practical inference speedup on S4 over mainstream inference platforms such as Nvidia T4. We also show that in practice a sparse model of larger size can achieve both higher accuracy and higher throughput on S4 than a dense model of smaller size."}

Moreover, with the development of technology, more and more embedded devices are available to run a Transformer model. For a Transformer model with different constraints (tight or loose), it can be deployed onto devices with different computing power. However, in previous work, designers did not choose the best device among multiple devices. Instead, they just used an existing device to deploy model, which was not necessarily the best fit and may lead to underutilization of resources. To address the deployment challenge of Transformer and the problem to select the best device, we propose an algorithm & hardware closed-loop acceleration framework. Given a dataset, a model, latency constraint LC and accuracy constraint AC, our framework can provide a best device satisfying both constraints. In order to generate a compressed model with high sparsity ratio, we propose a novel pruning technique, hierarchical pruning (HP). We optimize the sparse matrix storage format for HP matrix to further reduce memory usage for FPGA implementation. We design a accelerator that takes advantage of HP to solve the problem of concurrent random access. Experiments on Transformer and TinyBert model show that our framework can find different devices for various LC and AC, covering from low-end devices to high-end devices. Our HP can achieve higher sparsity ratio and is more flexible than other sparsity pattern. Our framework can achieve 37x, 1.9x, 1.7x speedup compared to CPU, GPU and FPGA, respectively."}

To solve this problem, extensive pruning techniques have been proposed for compressing networks. Recent advances based on the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) show that iterative model pruning tends to produce smaller and more accurate models. However, LTH research focuses on unstructured pruning, which is hardware-inefficient and difficult to accelerate on hardware platforms. In this paper, we investigate iterative pruning in the context of structured pruning because structurally pruned models map well on commodity hardware. We find that directly applying a structured weight-based pruning technique iteratively, called iterative L1-norm based pruning (ILP), does not produce accurate pruned models. To solve this problem, we propose two activation-based pruning methods, Iterative Activation-based Pruning (IAP) and Adaptive Iterative Activation-based Pruning (AIAP). We observe that, with only 1% accuracy loss, IAP and AIAP achieve 7.75X and 15.88$X compression on LeNet-5, and 1.25X and 1.71X compression on ResNet-50, whereas ILP achieves 4.77X and 1.13X, respectively."}

In this paper, we propose an efficient yet effective train-time pruning scheme, Parameter-free Differentiable Pruning (PDP), which offers state-of-the-art qualities in model size, accuracy, and training cost. PDP uses a dynamic function of weights during training to generate soft pruning masks for the weights in a parameter-free manner for a given pruning target. While differentiable, the simplicity and efficiency of PDP make it universal enough to deliver state-of-the-art random/structured/channel pruning results on various vision and natural language tasks. For example, for MobileNet-v1, PDP can achieve 68.2% top-1 ImageNet1k accuracy at 86.6% sparsity, which is 1.7% higher accuracy than those from the state-of-the-art algorithms. Also, PDP yields over 83.1% accuracy on Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference with 90% sparsity for BERT, while the next best from the existing techniques shows 81.5% accuracy. In addition, PDP can be applied to structured pruning, such as N:M pruning and channel pruning. For 1:4 structured pruning of ResNet18, PDP improved the top-1 ImageNet1k accuracy by over 3.6% over the state-of-the-art. For channel pruning of ResNet50, PDP reduced the top-1 ImageNet1k accuracy by 0.6% from the state-of-the-art."}

A uniform concentration analysis reveals the benefit of network capacity constraint for reducing generalization gap of the proposed meta-learner.

To this end, we propose the Summarization Program (SP), an interpretable modular framework consisting of an (ordered) list of binary trees, each encoding the step-by-step generative process of an abstractive summary sentence from the source document. A Summarization Program contains one root node per summary sentence, and a distinct tree connects each summary sentence (root node) to the document sentences (leaf nodes) from which it is derived, with the connecting nodes containing intermediate generated sentences. Edges represent different modular operations involved in summarization such as sentence fusion, compression, and paraphrasing. We first propose an efficient best-first search method over neural modules, SP-Search that identifies SPs for human summaries by directly optimizing for ROUGE scores. Next, using these programs as automatic supervision, we propose seq2seq models that generate Summarization Programs, which are then executed to obtain final summaries. We demonstrate that SP-Search effectively represents the generative process behind human summaries using modules that are typically faithful to their intended behavior. We also conduct a simulation study to show that Summarization Programs improve the interpretability of summarization models by allowing humans to better simulate model reasoning. Summarization Programs constitute a promising step toward interpretable and modular abstractive summarization, a complex task previously addressed primarily through blackbox end-to-end neural systems.

A general consensus on extractive summarization is that both relevance and coverage are critical issues to address. The existing methods designed to model coverage can be characterized by either reducing redundancy or increasing diversity in the summary. Maximal margin relevance (MMR) is a widely-cited method since it takes both relevance and redundancy into account when generating a summary for a given document. In addition to MMR, there is only a dearth of research concentrating on reducing redundancy or increasing diversity for the spoken document summarization task, as far as we are aware. Motivated by these observations, two major contributions are presented in this paper. First, in contrast to MMR, which considers coverage by reducing redundancy, we propose two novel coverage-based methods, which directly increase diversity. With the proposed methods, a set of representative sentences, which not only are relevant to the given document but also cover most of the important sub-themes of the document, can be selected automatically. Second, we make a step forward to plug in several document/sentence representation methods into the proposed framework to further enhance the summarization performance. A series of empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods."}

Few works exploited extracting finer-grained Elementary Discourse Unit (EDU) with little analysis and justification for the extractive unit selection. Further, the selection strategy of the fixed top-$k$ salient sentences fits the summarization need poorly, as the number of salient sentences in different documents varies and therefore a common or best $k$ does not exist in reality. To fill these gaps, this paper first conducts the comparison analysis of oracle summaries based on EDUs and sentences, which provides evidence from both theoretical and experimental perspectives to justify and quantify that EDUs make summaries with higher automatic evaluation scores than sentences. Then, considering this merit of EDUs, this paper further proposes an EDU-level extractive model with Varying summary Lengths and develops the corresponding learning algorithm. EDU-VL learns to encode and predict probabilities of EDUs in the document, generate multiple candidate summaries with varying lengths based on various $k$ values, and encode and score candidate summaries, in an end-to-end training manner. Finally, EDU-VL is experimented on single and multi-document benchmark datasets and shows improved performances on ROUGE scores in comparison with state-of-the-art extractive models, and further human evaluation suggests that EDU-constituent summaries maintain good grammaticality and readability."}

In this paper, we investigate the trade-offs incurred when aiming to control for inter-sentential cohesion and redundancy in extracted summaries, and their impact on their informativeness. As case study, we focus on the summarization of long, highly redundant documents and consider two optimization scenarios, reward-guided and with no supervision. In the reward-guided scenario, we compare systems that control for redundancy and cohesion during sentence scoring. In the unsupervised scenario, we introduce two systems that aim to control all three properties -- informativeness, redundancy, and cohesion -- in a principled way. Both systems implement a psycholinguistic theory that simulates how humans keep track of relevant content units and how cohesion and non-redundancy constraints are applied in short-term memory during reading. Extensive automatic and human evaluations reveal that systems optimizing for -- among other properties -- cohesion are capable of better organizing content in summaries compared to systems that optimize only for redundancy, while maintaining comparable informativeness. We find that the proposed unsupervised systems manage to extract highly cohesive summaries across varying levels of document redundancy, although sacrificing informativeness in the process. Finally, we lay evidence as to how simulated cognitive processes impact the trade-off between the analyzed summary properties."}

In this paper, we adapt TP-TRANSFORMER (Schlag et al., 2019), an architecture that enriches the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) with the explicitly compositional Tensor Product Representation (TPR), for the task of abstractive summarization. The key feature of our model is a structural bias that we introduce by encoding two separate representations for each token to represent the syntactic structure (with role vectors) and semantic content (with filler vectors) separately. The model then binds the role and filler vectors into the TPR as the layer output. We argue that the structured intermediate representations enable the model to take better control of the contents (salient facts) and structures (the syntax that connects the facts) when generating the summary. Empirically, we show that our TP-TRANSFORMER outperforms the Transformer and the original TP-TRANSFORMER significantly on several abstractive summarization datasets based on both automatic and human evaluations.

Structured weight pruning methods have been proposed to overcome the limitation of irregular network structure and demonstrated actual GPU acceleration. However, in prior work the pruning rate (degree of sparsity) and GPU acceleration are limited (to less than 50%) when accuracy needs to be maintained. In this work,we overcome these limitations by proposing a unified, systematic framework of structured weight pruning for DNNs. It is a framework that can be used to induce different types of structured sparsity, such as filter-wise, channel-wise, and shape-wise sparsity, as well non-structured sparsity. The proposed framework incorporates stochastic gradient descent with ADMM, and can be understood as a dynamic regularization method in which the regularization target is analytically updated in each iteration. Without loss of accuracy on the AlexNet model, we achieve 2.58X and 3.65X average measured speedup on two GPUs, clearly outperforming the prior work. The average speedups reach 3.15X and 8.52X when allowing a moderate ac-curacy loss of 2%.

Both strategies suffer from some limitations: the former kind is computationally expensive and difficult to converge, whilst the latter kind optimizes the reconstruction error but ignores the discriminative power of channels. To overcome these drawbacks, we investigate a simple-yet-effective method, called discrimination-aware channel pruning, to choose those channels that really contribute to discriminative power. To this end, we introduce additional losses into the network to increase the discriminative power of intermediate layers and then select the most discriminative channels for each layer by considering the additional loss and the reconstruction error. Last, we propose a greedy algorithm to conduct channel selection and parameter optimization in an iterative way. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Existing methods commonly set sparsity-inducing penalty terms to suppress the importance of dropped weights, which is regarded as the suppressed sparsification paradigm. However, this paradigm inactivates the dropped parts of networks causing capacity damage before pruning, thereby leading to performance degradation. To alleviate this issue, we first study and reveal the relative sparsity effect in emerging stimulative training and then propose a structured pruning framework, named STP, based on an enhanced sparsification paradigm which maintains the magnitude of dropped weights and enhances the expressivity of kept weights by self-distillation. Besides, to find an optimal architecture for the pruned network, we propose a multi-dimension architecture space and a knowledge distillation-guided exploration strategy. To reduce the huge capacity gap of distillation, we propose a subnet mutating expansion technique. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks indicate the effectiveness of STP. Specifically, without fine-tuning, our method consistently achieves superior performance at different budgets, especially under extremely aggressive pruning scenarios, e.g., remaining 95.11% Top-1 accuracy (72.43% in 76.15%) while reducing 85% FLOPs for ResNet-50 on ImageNet.

However, the resulting - typically irregular - sparse matrices hamper efficient hardware implementations, leading to additional memory usage and complex control logic that diminishes the benefits of unstructured pruning. This has spurred structured coarse-grained pruning solutions that prune entire filters or even layers, enabling efficient implementation at the expense of reduced flexibility. Here we propose a flexible new pruning mechanism that facilitates pruning at different granularities (weights, kernels, filters/feature maps), while retaining efficient memory organization (e.g. pruning exactly k-out-of-n weights for every output neuron, or pruning exactly k-out-of-n kernels for every feature map). We refer to this algorithm as Dynamic Probabilistic Pruning (DPP). DPP leverages the Gumbel-softmax relaxation for differentiable k-out-of-n sampling, facilitating end-to-end optimization. We show that DPP achieves competitive compression rates and classification accuracy when pruning common deep learning models trained on different benchmark datasets for image classification. Relevantly, the non-magnitude-based nature of DPP allows for joint optimization of pruning and weight quantization in order to even further compress the network, which we show as well. Finally, we propose novel information theoretic metrics that show the confidence and pruning diversity of pruning masks within a layer."}

Benchmarking in this domain heavily relies on faithful representation of the sparsity of subnetworks, which has been traditionally computed as the fraction of removed connections (direct sparsity). This definition, however, fails to recognize unpruned parameters that detached from input or output layers of underlying subnetworks, potentially underestimating actual effective sparsity: the fraction of inactivated connections. While this effect might be negligible for moderately pruned networks (up to 10-100 compression rates), we find that it plays an increasing role for thinner subnetworks, greatly distorting comparison between different pruning algorithms. For example, we show that effective compression of a randomly pruned LeNet-300-100 can be orders of magnitude larger than its direct counterpart, while no discrepancy is ever observed when using SynFlow for pruning [Tanaka et al., 2020]. In this work, we adopt the lens of effective sparsity to reevaluate several recent pruning algorithms on common benchmark architectures (e.g., LeNet-300-100, VGG-19, ResNet-18) and discover that their absolute and relative performance changes dramatically in this new and more appropriate framework. To aim for effective, rather than direct, sparsity, we develop a low-cost extension to most pruning algorithms. Further, equipped with effective sparsity as a reference frame, we partially reconfirm that random pruning with appropriate sparsity allocation across layers performs as well or better than more sophisticated algorithms for pruning at initialization [Su et al., 2020]. In response to this observation, using a simple analogy of pressure distribution in coupled cylinders from physics, we design novel layerwise sparsity quotas that outperform all existing baselines in the context of random pruning."}

As one of the most common techniques, pruning has been studied for a long time. By exploiting the structured sparsity of the neural network, existing methods can prune neurons instead of individual weights. However, in most existing pruning methods, surviving neurons are randomly connected in the neural network without any structure, and the non-zero weights within each neuron are also randomly distributed. Such irregular sparse structure can cause very high control overhead and irregular memory access for the hardware and even increase the neural network computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a three-layer hierarchical prior to promote a more regular sparse structure during pruning. The proposed three-layer hierarchical prior can achieve per-neuron weight-level structured sparsity and neuron-level structured sparsity. We derive an efficient Turbo-variational Bayesian inferencing (Turbo-VBI) algorithm to solve the resulting model compression problem with the proposed prior. The proposed Turbo-VBI algorithm has low complexity and can support more general priors than existing model compression algorithms. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can promote a more regular structure in the pruned neural networks while achieving even better performance in terms of compression rate and inferencing accuracy compared with the baselines."}

It motivates the intensive research on model compression with two main approaches. Weight pruning leverages the redundancy in the number of weights and can be performed in a non-structured, which has higher flexibility and pruning rate but incurs index accesses due to irregular weights, or structured manner, which preserves the full matrix structure with lower pruning rate. Weight quantization leverages the redundancy in the number of bits in weights. Compared to pruning, quantization is much more hardware-friendly, and has become a \"must-do\" step for FPGA and ASIC implementations. This paper provides a definitive answer to the question for the first time. First, we build ADMM-NN-S by extending and enhancing ADMM-NN, a recently proposed joint weight pruning and quantization framework. Second, we develop a methodology for fair and fundamental comparison of non-structured and structured pruning in terms of both storage and computation efficiency. Our results show that ADMM-NN-S consistently outperforms the prior art: (i) it achieves 348x, 36x, and 8x overall weight pruning on LeNet-5, AlexNet, and ResNet-50, respectively, with (almost) zero accuracy loss; (ii) we demonstrate the first fully binarized (for all layers) DNNs can be lossless in accuracy in many cases. These results provide a strong baseline and credibility of our study. Based on the proposed comparison framework, with the same accuracy and quantization, the results show that non-structrued pruning is not competitive in terms of both storage and computation efficiency. Thus, we conclude that non-structured pruning is considered harmful. We urge the community not to continue the DNN inference acceleration for non-structured sparsity."}

Due to the high computational complexity and memory footprint of neural networks, various compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, have been proposed in literature. Pruning sparsifies a neural network, reducing the number of multiplications and memory. However, pruning often fails to capture properties of the underlying hardware, causing unstructured sparsity and load-balance inefficiency, thus bottlenecking resource improvements. We propose a hardware-centric formulation of pruning, by formulating it as a knapsack problem with resource-aware tensor structures. Evaluated on a range of tasks, including sub-microsecond particle classification at CERN's Large Hadron Collider and fast image classification, the proposed method achieves reductions ranging between 55% and 92% in the DSP utilization and up to 81% in BRAM utilization."}

In most of the previous research works, sparsity is imposed stochastically without considering any prior knowledge of the weights distribution or other internal network characteristics. Enforcing too much sparsity may induce accuracy drop due to the fact that a lot of important elements might have been eliminated. In this paper, we propose Guided Attention for Sparsity Learning (GASL) to achieve (1) model compression by having less number of elements and speed-up; (2) prevent the accuracy drop by supervising the sparsity operation via a guided attention mechanism and (3) introduce a generic mechanism that can be adapted for any type of architecture; Our work is aimed at providing a framework based on interpretable attention mechanisms for imposing structured and non-structured sparsity in deep neural networks.

In particular, we propose an effective pruning strategy for selecting redundant low-precision filters. Furthermore, we leverage Bayesian optimization to efficiently determine the pruning ratio for each layer. We conduct extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with various architectures and precisions. In particular, for ResNet-18 on ImageNet, we prune 26.12% of the model size with Binarized Neural Network quantization, achieving a top-1 classification accuracy of 47.32% in a model of 2.47 MB and 59.30% with a 2-bit DoReFa-Net in 4.36 MB."}

The two predominant approaches are pruning, which gradually removes weights from a pre-trained model, and distillation, which trains a smaller compact model to match a larger one. Pruning methods can significantly reduce the model size but hardly achieve large speedups as distillation. However, distillation methods require large amounts of unlabeled data and are expensive to train. In this work, we propose a task-specific structured pruning method CoFi (Coarse- and Fine-grained Pruning), which delivers highly parallelizable subnetworks and matches the distillation methods in both accuracy and latency, without resorting to any unlabeled data. Our key insight is to jointly prune coarse-grained (e.g., layers) and fine-grained (e.g., heads and hidden units) modules, which controls the pruning decision of each parameter with masks of different granularity. We also devise a layerwise distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from unpruned to pruned models during optimization. Our experiments on GLUE and SQuAD datasets show that CoFi yields models with over 10x speedups with a small accuracy drop, showing its effectiveness and efficiency compared to previous pruning and distillation approaches."}

Structured network pruning discards the whole neuron or filter, leading to accuracy loss. In this work, we propose a novel concept of neuron merging applicable to both fully connected layers and convolution layers, which compensates for the information loss due to the pruned neurons/filters. Neuron merging starts with decomposing the original weights into two matrices/tensors. One of them becomes the new weights for the current layer, and the other is what we name a scaling matrix, guiding the combination of neurons. If the activation function is ReLU, the scaling matrix can be absorbed into the next layer under certain conditions, compensating for the removed neurons. We also propose a data-free and inexpensive method to decompose the weights by utilizing the cosine similarity between neurons. Compared to the pruned model with the same topology, our merged model better preserves the output feature map of the original model; thus, it maintains the accuracy after pruning without fine-tuning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over network pruning for various model architectures and datasets. As an example, for VGG-16 on CIFAR-10, we achieve an accuracy of 93.16% while reducing 64% of total parameters, without any fine-tuning.

Most available filter pruning methods require complex treatments such as iterative pruning, features statistics/ranking, or additional optimization designs in the training process. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective regularization strategy from a new perspective of evolution of features, which we call feature flow regularization (FFR), for improving structured sparsity and filter pruning in DNNs. Specifically, FFR imposes controls on the gradient and curvature of feature flow along the neural network, which implicitly increases the sparsity of the parameters. The principle behind FFR is that coherent and smooth evolution of features will lead to an efficient network that avoids redundant parameters. The high structured sparsity obtained from FFR enables us to prune filters effectively. Experiments with VGGNets, ResNets on CIFAR-10/100, and Tiny ImageNet datasets demonstrate that FFR can significantly improve both unstructured and structured sparsity. Our pruning results in terms of reduction of parameters and FLOPs are comparable to or even better than those of state-of-the-art pruning methods."}

We study this via layer pruning: if removing a certain layer does not affect model performance in common question-answering benchmarks, then the weights in that layer are not necessary for storing the knowledge needed to answer those questions. To find these unnecessary parameters, we identify the optimal block of layers to prune by considering similarity across layers; then, to \"heal\" the damage, we perform a small amount of finetuning. Surprisingly, with this method we find minimal degradation of performance until after a large fraction (up to half) of the layers are removed for some common open-weight models. From a scientific perspective, the robustness of these LLMs to the deletion of layers implies either that current pretraining methods are not properly leveraging the parameters in the deeper layers of the network or that the shallow layers play a critical role in storing knowledge. For our study, we use parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) methods, specifically quantization and Low Rank Adapters (QLoRA), such that each of our experiments can be performed on a single 40GB A100 GPU."}

While filter and channel pruning are preferable to other structure pruning methods in terms of realistic acceleration and hardware compatibility, pruning methods with a finer granularity, such as intra-channel pruning, are expected to be capable of yielding more compact and computationally efficient networks. Typical intra-channel pruning methods utilize a static and hand-crafted pruning granularity due to a large search space, which leaves room for improvement in their pruning performance. In this work, we introduce a novel structure pruning method, termed as dynamic structure pruning, to identify optimal pruning granularities for intra-channel pruning. In contrast to existing intra-channel pruning methods, the proposed method automatically optimizes dynamic pruning granularities in each layer while training deep neural networks. To achieve this, we propose a differentiable group learning method designed to efficiently learn a pruning granularity based on gradient-based learning of filter groups. The experimental results show that dynamic structure pruning achieves state-of-the-art pruning performance and better realistic acceleration on a GPU compared with channel pruning.

Deep CNNs can either be pruned width-wise by removing filters based on their importance or depth-wise by removing layers and blocks. Width wise pruning (filter pruning) is commonly performed via learnable gates or switches and sparsity regularizers whereas pruning of layers has so far been performed arbitrarily by manually designing a smaller network usually referred to as a student network. We propose a comprehensive pruning strategy that can perform both width-wise as well as depth-wise pruning. This is achieved by introducing gates at different granularities (neuron, filter, layer, block) which are then controlled via an objective function that simultaneously performs pruning at different granularity during each forward pass. Our approach is applicable to wide-variety of architectures without any constraints on spatial dimensions or connection type (sequential, residual, parallel or inception).

In this paper, we propose a pruning framework that adaptively determines the number of each layer's channels as well as the wights inheritance criteria for sub-network. Firstly, evaluate the importance of each block in the network based on the mean of the scaling parameters of the BN layers. Secondly, use the bisection method to quickly find the compact sub-network satisfying the budget. Finally, adaptively and efficiently choose the weight inheritance criterion that fits the current architecture and fine-tune the pruned network to recover performance. AdaPruner allows to obtain pruned network quickly, accurately and efficiently, taking into account both the structure and initialization weights.

Although these methods surpass the trivial baseline of random pruning, they remain below the accuracy of magnitude pruning after training, and we endeavor to understand why. We show that, unlike pruning after training, randomly shuffling the weights these methods prune within each layer or sampling new initial values preserves or improves accuracy. As such, the per-weight pruning decisions made by these methods can be replaced by a per-layer choice of the fraction of weights to prune. This property suggests broader challenges with the underlying pruning heuristics, the desire to prune at initialization, or both."}

In most cases, the computations to remove are selected based on a relative importance criterion. At the same time, the need for explainable predictive models has risen tremendously and motivated the development of robust attribution methods that highlight the relative importance of pixels of an input image or feature map. In this work, we discuss the limitations of existing pruning heuristics, among which magnitude and gradient-based methods. We draw inspiration from attribution methods to design a novel integrated gradient pruning criterion, in which the relevance of each neuron is defined as the integral of the gradient variation on a path towards this neuron removal.

Model compression has been proposed as a promising technique to improve the running efficiency via parameter and operation reduction. Whereas, this technique is mainly practiced in ANNs rather than SNNs. It is interesting to answer how much an SNN model can be compressed without compromising its functionality, where two challenges should be addressed: i) the accuracy of SNNs is usually sensitive to model compression, which requires an accurate compression methodology; ii) the computation of SNNs is event-driven rather than static, which produces an extra compression dimension on dynamic spikes. To this end, we realize a comprehensive SNN compression through three steps. First, we formulate the connection pruning and weight quantization as a constrained optimization problem. Second, we combine spatio-temporal backpropagation (STBP) and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve the problem with minimum accuracy loss. Third, we further propose activity regularization to reduce the spike events for fewer active operations. These methods can be applied in either a single way for moderate compression or a joint way for aggressive compression. We define several quantitative metrics to evaluation the compression performance for SNNs. Our methodology is validated in pattern recognition tasks over MNIST, N-MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 datasets, where extensive comparisons, analyses, and insights are provided.

A key feature of a good pruning algorithm is that it accurately quantifies the relative importance of the model weights. While model pruning has a rich history, we still don't have a full grasp of the pruning mechanics even for relatively simple problems involving linear models or shallow neural nets. In this work, we provide a principled exploration of pruning by building on a natural notion of importance. For linear models, we show that this notion of importance is captured by covariance scaling which connects to the well-known Hessian-based pruning. We then derive asymptotic formulas that allow us to precisely compare the performance of different pruning methods. For neural networks, we demonstrate that the importance can be at odds with larger magnitudes and proper initialization is critical for magnitude-based pruning. Specifically, we identify settings in which weights become more important despite becoming smaller, which in turn leads to a catastrophic failure of magnitude-based pruning. Our results also elucidate that implicit regularization in the form of Hessian structure has a catalytic role in identifying the important weights, which dictate the pruning performance."}

However, the ranking of filters according to their \"importance\" on different pruning criteria may be inconsistent. One filter could be important according to a certain criterion, while it is unnecessary according to another one, which indicates that each criterion is only a partial view of the comprehensive \"importance\".

The model is adapted sequentially over incoming unsupervised streaming data batches. This enables improvements over several batches without the need for any additionally annotated data. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, we modify associative domain adaptation to work well on source and target data batches with unequal class distributions.

Existing channel pruning algorithms for CNNs have achieved plenty of success on complex models. They approach the pruning problem from various perspectives and use different metrics to guide the pruning process. However, these metrics mainly focus on the model's `outputs' or `weights' and neglect its `interpretations' information. To fill in this gap, we propose to address the channel pruning problem from a novel perspective by leveraging the interpretations of a model to steer the pruning process, thereby utilizing information from both inputs and outputs of the model. However, existing interpretation methods cannot get deployed to achieve our goal as either they are inefficient for pruning or may predict non-coherent explanations. We tackle this challenge by introducing a selector model that predicts real-time smooth saliency masks for pruned models. We parameterize the distribution of explanatory masks by Radial Basis Function (RBF)-like functions to incorporate geometric prior of natural images in our selector model's inductive bias. Thus, we can obtain compact representations of explanations to reduce the computational costs of our pruning method. We leverage our selector model to steer the network pruning by maximizing the similarity of explanatory representations for the pruned and original models.

While the majority of previous work has focused on the extractive setting, i.e., selecting fragments from input reviews to produce a summary, we let the model generate novel sentences and hence produce abstractive summaries. Recent progress in summarization has seen the development of supervised models which rely on large quantities of document-summary pairs. Since such training data is expensive to acquire, we instead consider the unsupervised setting, in other words, we do not use any summaries in training. We define a generative model for a review collection which capitalizes on the intuition that when generating a new review given a set of other reviews of a product, we should be able to control the \"amount of novelty\" going into the new review or, equivalently, vary the extent to which it deviates from the input. At test time, when generating summaries, we force the novelty to be minimal, and produce a text reflecting consensus opinions. We capture this intuition by defining a hierarchical variational autoencoder model. Both individual reviews and the products they correspond to are associated with stochastic latent codes, and the review generator (\"decoder\") has direct access to the text of input reviews through the pointer-generator mechanism. Experiments on Amazon and Yelp datasets, show that setting at test time the review's latent code to its mean, allows the model to produce fluent and coherent summaries reflecting common opinions."}

Most existing methods rely on multi-stage optimizations in a layer-wise manner for iteratively pruning and retraining which may not be optimal and may be computation intensive. Besides, these methods are designed for pruning a specific structure, such as filter or block structures without jointly pruning heterogeneous structures. In this paper, we propose an effective structured pruning approach that jointly prunes filters as well as other structures in an end-to-end manner. To accomplish this, we first introduce a soft mask to scale the output of these structures by defining a new objective function with sparsity regularization to align the output of baseline and network with this mask. We then effectively solve the optimization problem by generative adversarial learning (GAL), which learns a sparse soft mask in a label-free and an end-to-end manner. By forcing more scaling factors in the soft mask to zero, the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA) can be leveraged to fast and reliably remove the corresponding structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GAL on different datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet ILSVRC 2012. For example, on ImageNet ILSVRC 2012, the pruned ResNet-50 achieves 10.88\\% Top-5 error and results in a factor of 3.7x speedup. This significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods."}

As a common practice for model compression, network pruning consists of two major categories: unstructured and structured pruning, where unstructured pruning constantly performs better. However, unstructured pruning presents a structured pattern at high pruning rates, which limits its performance. To this end, we propose a Rank-based PruninG (RPG) method to maintain the ranks of sparse weights in an adversarial manner. In each step, we minimize the low-rank approximation error for the weight matrices using singular value decomposition, and maximize their distance by pushing the weight matrices away from its low rank approximation. This rank-based optimization objective guides sparse weights towards a high-rank topology. The proposed method is conducted in a gradual pruning fashion to stabilize the change of rank during training. Experimental results on various datasets and different tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in high sparsity. The proposed RPG outperforms the state-of-the-art performance by 1.13% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet in ResNet-50 with 98% sparsity.

Previous first-order methods successfully compress PLMs to extremely high sparsity with little performance drop. These methods, such as movement pruning, use first-order information to prune PLMs while fine-tuning the remaining weights. In this work, we argue fine-tuning is redundant for first-order pruning, since first-order pruning is sufficient to converge PLMs to downstream tasks without fine-tuning. Under this motivation, we propose Static Model Pruning (SMP), which only uses first-order pruning to adapt PLMs to downstream tasks while achieving the target sparsity level. In addition, we also design a new masking function and training objective to further improve SMP. Extensive experiments at various sparsity levels show SMP has significant improvements over first-order and zero-order methods. Unlike previous first-order methods, SMP is also applicable to low sparsity and outperforms zero-order methods. Meanwhile, SMP is more parameter efficient than other methods due to it does not require fine-tuning."}

This results in significant memory requirement as well as computational overheads. Consequently, there is a growing need for filter-level pruning approaches for compressing CNN based models that not only reduce the total number of parameters but reduce the overall computation as well. We present a new min-max framework for filter-level pruning of CNNs. Our framework, called Play and Prune (PP), jointly prunes and fine-tunes CNN model parameters, with an adaptive pruning rate, while maintaining the model's predictive performance. Our framework consists of two modules: (1) An adaptive filter pruning (AFP) module, which minimizes the number of filters in the model; and (2) A pruning rate controller (PRC) module, which maximizes the accuracy during pruning. Moreover, unlike most previous approaches, our approach allows directly specifying the desired error tolerance instead of pruning level. Our compressed models can be deployed at run-time, without requiring any special libraries or hardware.

Recently, many novel CNN structures have been designed to address increasingly challenging tasks. To make them work efficiently on edge devices, researchers have proposed various structured network pruning strategies to reduce their memory and computational cost. However, most of them only focus on reducing the number of filter channels per layer without considering the redundancy within individual filter channels. In this work, we explore pruning from another dimension, the kernel size. We develop a CNN pruning framework called SMOF, which Squeezes More Out of Filters by reducing both kernel size and the number of filter channels. Notably, SMOF is friendly to standard hardware devices without any customized low-level implementations, and the pruning effort by kernel size reduction does not suffer from the fixed-size width constraint in SIMD units of general-purpose processors. The pruned networks can be deployed effortlessly with significant running time reduction. We also support these claims via extensive experiments on various CNN structures and general-purpose processors for mobile devices."}

We find that models with radically different numbers of weights have comparable top-line performance metrics but diverge considerably in behavior on a narrow subset of the dataset. This small subset of data points, which we term Pruning Identified Exemplars (PIEs) are systematically more impacted by the introduction of sparsity. Compression disproportionately impacts model performance on the underrepresented long-tail of the data distribution. PIEs over-index on atypical or noisy images that are far more challenging for both humans and algorithms to classify.

Therefore, we investigate the problem of training effective NN models on constrained devices having a fixed, potentially small, memory budget. We target techniques that are both resource-efficient and performance effective while enabling significant network compression. Our Dynamic Hard Pruning (DynHP) technique incrementally prunes the network during training, identifying neurons that marginally contribute to the model accuracy. DynHP enables a tunable size reduction of the final neural network and reduces the NN memory occupancy during training. Freed memory is reused by a \\emph{dynamic batch sizing} approach to counterbalance the accuracy degradation caused by the hard pruning strategy, improving its convergence and effectiveness. We assess the performance of DynHP through reproducible experiments on three public datasets, comparing them against reference competitors.

Recently, it was shown that CNNs can exploit other invariances, such as rotation invariance, by using group convolutions instead of planar convolutions. However, for reasons of performance and ease of implementation, it has been necessary to limit the group convolution to transformations that can be applied to the filters without interpolation. Thus, for images with square pixels, only integer translations, rotations by multiples of 90 degrees, and reflections are admissible. Whereas the square tiling provides a 4-fold rotational symmetry, a hexagonal tiling of the plane has a 6-fold rotational symmetry. In this paper we show how one can efficiently implement planar convolution and group convolution over hexagonal lattices, by re-using existing highly optimized convolution routines. We find that, due to the reduced anisotropy of hexagonal filters, planar HexaConv provides better accuracy than planar convolution with square filters, given a fixed parameter budget. Furthermore, we find that the increased degree of symmetry of the hexagonal grid increases the effectiveness of group convolutions, by allowing for more parameter sharing. We show that our method significantly outperforms conventional CNNs on the AID aerial scene classification dataset, even outperforming ImageNet pre-trained models."}

This motivation is particularly relevant given the perhaps surprising observation that a wide variety of pruning approaches increase test accuracy despite sometimes massive reductions in parameter counts. To better understand this phenomenon, we analyze the behavior of pruning over the course of training, finding that pruning's benefit to generalization increases with pruning's instability (defined as the drop in test accuracy immediately following pruning). We demonstrate that this \"generalization-stability tradeoff\" is present across a wide variety of pruning settings and propose a mechanism for its cause: pruning regularizes similarly to noise injection. Supporting this, we find less pruning stability leads to more model flatness and the benefits of pruning do not depend on permanent parameter removal. These results explain the compatibility of pruning-based generalization improvements and the high generalization recently observed in overparameterized networks."}

However, pruning usually results in irregular network connections that not only demand extra representation efforts but also do not fit well on parallel computation. We introduce structured sparsity at various scales for convolutional neural networks, which are channel wise, kernel wise and intra kernel strided sparsity. This structured sparsity is very advantageous for direct computational resource savings on embedded computers, parallel computing environments and hardware based systems. To decide the importance of network connections and paths, the proposed method uses a particle filtering approach. The importance weight of each particle is assigned by computing the misclassification rate with corresponding connectivity pattern. The pruned network is re-trained to compensate for the losses due to pruning. While implementing convolutions as matrix products, we particularly show that intra kernel strided sparsity with a simple constraint can significantly reduce the size of kernel and feature map matrices. The pruned network is finally fixed point optimized with reduced word length precision. This results in significant reduction in the total storage size providing advantages for on-chip memory based implementations of deep neural networks."}

Considering task execution time as a random variable, we use probabilistic analysis to develop an autonomous proactive task dropping mechanism to attain our robustness goal. Specifically, we provide a mathematical model that identifies the optimality of a task dropping decision, so that the system robustness is maximized. Then, we leverage the mathematical model to develop a task dropping heuristic that achieves the system robustness within a feasible time complexity. Although the proposed model is generic and can be applied to any distributed system, we concentrate on heterogeneous computing (HC) systems that have a higher degree of exposure to uncertainty than homogeneous systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the autonomous proactive dropping mechanism can improve the system robustness by up to 20%."}

However, the current state-of-the-art assumes that the effective sub-network and the other superfluous parameters in the given network share the same distribution, where pruning inevitably involves a distribution truncation operation. They usually eliminate values near zero. While simple, it may not be the most appropriate method, as effective models may naturally have many small values associated with them. Removing near-zero values already embedded in model space may significantly reduce model accuracy. Another line of work has proposed to assign discrete prior over all possible sub-structures that still rely on human-crafted prior hypotheses. Worse still, existing methods use regularized point estimates, namely Hard Pruning, that can not provide error estimations and fail reliability justification for the pruned networks. In this paper, we propose a novel distribution-lossless pruning method, named DLLP, to theoretically find the pruned lottery within Bayesian treatment. Specifically, DLLP remodels the vanilla networks as discrete priors for the latent pruned model and the other redundancy. More importantly, DLLP uses Stein Variational Inference to approach the latent prior and effectively bypasses calculating KL divergence with unknown distribution. Extensive experiments based on small Cifar-10 and large-scaled ImageNet demonstrate that our method can obtain sparser networks with great generalization performance while providing quantified reliability for the pruned model."}

Recent exploration of pre-training pruning at initialization hints on training cost reduction via pruning, but suffers noticeable performance degradation. We attempt to combine the benefits of both directions and propose a policy that prunes as early as possible during training without hurting performance. Instead of pruning at initialization, our method exploits initial dense training for few epochs to quickly guide the architecture, while constantly evaluating dominant sub-networks via neuron importance ranking. This unveils dominant sub-networks whose structures turn stable, allowing conventional pruning to be pushed earlier into the training. To do this early, we further introduce an Early Pruning Indicator (EPI) that relies on sub-network architectural similarity and quickly triggers pruning when the sub-network's architecture stabilizes. Through extensive experiments on ImageNet, we show that EPI empowers a quick tracking of early training epochs suitable for pruning, offering same efficacy as an otherwise ``oracle'' grid-search that scans through epochs and requires orders of magnitude more compute.

However, it is non-trivial to efficiently utilize large-scale cluster resources to develop LLMs, often riddled with numerous challenges such as frequent hardware failures, intricate parallelization strategies, and imbalanced resource utilization. In this paper, we present an in-depth characterization study of a six-month LLM development workload trace collected from our GPU datacenter Acme. Specifically, we investigate discrepancies between LLMs and prior task-specific Deep Learning (DL) workloads, explore resource utilization patterns, and identify the impact of various job failures. Our analysis summarizes hurdles we encountered and uncovers potential opportunities to optimize systems tailored for LLMs. Furthermore, we introduce our system efforts: (1) fault-tolerant pretraining, which enhances fault tolerance through LLM-involved failure diagnosis and automatic recovery. (2) decoupled scheduling for evaluation, which achieves timely performance feedback via trial decomposition and scheduling optimization."}

Pruning is one technique to remove unnecessary weights and reduce resource requirements for training and inference. In addition, for ML tasks where the input data is multi-dimensional, using higher-dimensional data embeddings such as complex numbers or quaternions has been shown to reduce the parameter count while maintaining accuracy. In this work, we conduct pruning on real and quaternion-valued implementations of different architectures on classification tasks. We find that for some architectures, at very high sparsity levels, quaternion models provide higher accuracies than their real counterparts. For example, at the task of image classification on CIFAR-10 using Conv-4, at $3\\%$ of the number of parameters as the original model, the pruned quaternion version outperforms the pruned real by more than $10\\%$. Experiments on various network architectures and datasets show that for deployment in extremely resource-constrained environments, a sparse quaternion network might be a better candidate than a real sparse model of similar architecture."}

Much effort has been made to overcome this challenge by using either the abstractive or extractive methods. Extractive methods are more popular, due to their simplicity compared with the more elaborate abstractive methods. In extractive approaches, the system will not generate sentences. Instead, it learns how to score sentences within the text by using some textual features and subsequently selecting those with the highest-rank. Therefore, the core objective is ranking and it highly depends on the document. This dependency has been unnoticed by many state-of-the-art solutions. In this work, the features of the document are integrated into vectors of every sentence. In this way, the system becomes informed about the context, increases the precision of the learned model and consequently produces comprehensive and brief summaries."}

However, the level of actual abstraction as measured by novel phrases that do not appear in the source document remains low in existing approaches. We propose two techniques to improve the level of abstraction of generated summaries. First, we decompose the decoder into a contextual network that retrieves relevant parts of the source document, and a pretrained language model that incorporates prior knowledge about language generation. Second, we propose a novelty metric that is optimized directly through policy learning to encourage the generation of novel phrases. Our model achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art models, as determined by ROUGE scores and human evaluations, while achieving a significantly higher level of abstraction as measured by n-gram overlap with the source document."}

So far, summarization researchers have given considerably more attention to relevance than to background knowledge. In contrast, this work puts background knowledge in the foreground. Building on the realization that the choices made by human summarizers and annotators contain implicit information about their background knowledge, we develop and compare techniques for inferring background knowledge from summarization data. Based on this framework, we define summary scoring functions that explicitly model background knowledge, and show that these scoring functions fit human judgments significantly better than baselines. We illustrate some of the many potential applications of our framework. First, we provide insights into human information importance priors. Second, we demonstrate that averaging the background knowledge of multiple, potentially biased annotators or corpora greatly improves summary-scoring performance.

By simply changing the way the sparsity regularization is enforced, filter pruning and low-rank decomposition can be derived accordingly. This provides another flexible choice for network compression because the techniques complement each other. For example, in popular network architectures with shortcut connections (e.g. ResNet), filter pruning cannot deal with the last convolutional layer in a ResBlock while the low-rank decomposition methods can. In addition, we propose to compress the whole network jointly instead of in a layer-wise manner. Our approach proves its potential as it compares favorably to the state-of-the-art on several benchmarks."}

Model compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, have recently shown promising results by improving model complexity with little loss in performance. In this work, we extended pruning, a compression technique that discards unnecessary model connections, and weight sharing techniques for the task of object detection. With our approach, we are able to compress a state-of-the-art object detection model by 30.0% without a loss in performance. We also show that our compressed model can be easily initialized with existing pre-trained weights, and thus is able to fully utilize published state-of-the-art model zoos."}

While the potential of deploying DNNs on resource-constrained platforms has been demonstrated by DNN compression techniques, the current practice suffers from two limitations: 1) merely stand-alone compression schemes are investigated even though each compression technique only suit for certain types of DNN layers; and 2) mostly compression techniques are optimized for DNNs' inference accuracy, without explicitly considering other application-driven system performance (e.g., latency and energy cost) and the varying resource availability across platforms (e.g., storage and processing capability). To this end, we propose AdaDeep, a usage-driven, automated DNN compression framework for systematically exploring the desired trade-off between performance and resource constraints, from a holistic system level. Specifically, in a layer-wise manner, AdaDeep automatically selects the most suitable combination of compression techniques and the corresponding compression hyperparameters for a given DNN. Thorough evaluations on six datasets and across twelve devices demonstrate that AdaDeep can achieve up to $18.6\\times$ latency reduction, $9.8\\times$ energy-efficiency improvement, and $37.3\\times$ storage reduction in DNNs while incurring negligible accuracy loss. Furthermore, AdaDeep also uncovers multiple novel combinations of compression techniques."}

Model pruning is an effective technique to reduce computation overhead for deep neural networks by removing redundant parameters. However, modern recommendation systems are still thirsty for model capacity due to the demand for handling big data. Thus, pruning a recommendation model at scale results in a smaller model capacity and consequently lower accuracy. To reduce computation cost without sacrificing model capacity, we propose a dynamic training scheme, namely alternate model growth and pruning, to alternatively construct and prune weights in the course of training. Our method leverages structured sparsification to reduce computational cost without hurting the model capacity at the end of offline training so that a full-size model is available in the recurring training stage to learn new data in real-time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide in-depth experiments and discussion of applying structural dynamics to recommendation systems at scale to reduce training cost. The proposed method is validated with an open-source deep-learning recommendation model (DLRM) and state-of-the-art industrial-scale production models."}

In an inconsistently heterogeneous computing system, task types have different execution times on heterogeneous machines. A method is required to map arriving tasks to machines based on machine availability and performance, maximizing the number of tasks meeting deadlines (defined as robustness). For tasks with hard deadlines (eg those in live video streaming), tasks that miss their deadlines are dropped. The problem investigated in this research is maximizing the robustness of an oversubscribed HC system. A way to maximize this robustness is to prune (ie defer or drop) tasks with low probability of meeting their deadlines to increase the probability of other tasks meeting their deadlines. In this paper, we first provide a mathematical model to estimate a task's probability of meeting its deadline in the presence of task dropping. We then investigate methods for engaging probabilistic dropping and we find thresholds for dropping and deferring. Next, we develop a pruning-aware mapping heuristic and extend it to engender fairness across various task types. We show the cost benefit of using probabilistic pruning in an HC system. Simulation results, harnessing a selection of mapping heuristics, show efficacy of the pruning mechanism in improving robustness (on average by 25%) and cost in an oversubscribed HC system by up to 40%."}

Additionally, users may have privacy concerns when interacting with remote LLMs. In this paper, we envision a decentralized system unlocking the potential vast untapped consumer-level GPUs in pre-training, inference and fine-tuning of LLMs with privacy protection. However, this system faces critical challenges, including limited CPU and GPU memory, low network bandwidth, the variability of peer and device heterogeneity. To address these challenges, our system design incorporates: 1) a broker with backup pool to implement dynamic join and quit of computing providers; 2) task scheduling with hardware performance to improve system efficiency; 3) abstracting ML procedures into directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to achieve model and task universality; 4) abstracting intermediate represention and execution planes to ensure compatibility of various devices and deep learning (DL) frameworks.

The disparities in resource usage can result in interference, which in turn can lead to unpredictable co-running behaviors. To better understand application interference, prior work provided detailed execution characterization. However, these characterization approaches either emphasize on traditional benchmarks or fall into a single application domain. To address this issue, we study 25 up-to-date applications and benchmarks from various application domains and form 625 consolidation pairs to thoroughly analyze the execution interference caused by application co-running. Moreover, we leverage mini-benchmarks and real applications to pinpoint the provenance of co-running interference in both hardware and software aspects."}

When researchers label studies, they can screen ranked documents where relevant documents are higher than irrelevant ones. This practice, known as screening prioritization (ie., document ranking approach), speeds up the process of conducting a SR as the documents labelled as relevant can move to the next tasks earlier. However, the approach is limited in reducing the manual workload because the total number of documents to screen remains the same. Towards reducing the manual workload in the screening process, we investigate the quality of document ranking of SR. This can signal researchers whereabouts in the ranking relevant studies are located and let them decide where to stop the screening. After extensive analysis on SR document rankings from different ranking models, we hypothesize 'topic broadness' as a factor that affects the ranking quality of SR. Finally, we propose a measure that estimates the topic broadness and demonstrate that the proposed measure is a simple yet effective method to predict the qualities of document rankings for SRs."}

While some popular approaches address summarization as a single end-to-end task, prominent works support decomposed modeling for individual subtasks. Further, semi-automated text reduction is also very appealing, where users may identify targeted content while models would generate a corresponding coherent summary. In this paper, we focus on the second subtask, of generating coherent text given pre-selected content. Concretely, we formalize \\textit{Controlled Text Reduction} as a standalone task, whose input is a source text with marked spans of targeted content (\"highlighting\"). A model then needs to generate a coherent text that includes all and only the target information. We advocate the potential of such models, both for modular fully-automatic summarization, as well as for semi-automated human-in-the-loop use cases. Facilitating proper research, we crowdsource high-quality dev and test datasets for the task.

Consequently, they can often be compressed using techniques such as weight pruning and quantization that reduce both the model size and inference time without appreciable loss in accuracy. However, finding the best compression strategy and corresponding target sparsity for a given DNN, hardware platform, and optimization objective currently requires expensive, frequently manual, trial-and-error experimentation. In this paper, we introduce a programmable system for model compression called Condensa. Users programmatically compose simple operators, in Python, to build more complex and practically interesting compression strategies. Given a strategy and user-provided objective (such as minimization of running time), Condensa uses a novel Bayesian optimization-based algorithm to automatically infer desirable sparsities.

Numerous network compression methods such as pruning and quantization are proposed to reduce the model size significantly, of which the key is to find suitable compression allocation (e.g., pruning sparsity and quantization codebook) of each layer. Existing solutions obtain the compression allocation in an iterative/manual fashion while finetuning the compressed model, thus suffering from the efficiency issue. Different from the prior art, we propose a novel One-shot Pruning-Quantization (OPQ) in this paper, which analytically solves the compression allocation with pre-trained weight parameters only. During finetuning, the compression module is fixed and only weight parameters are updated. To our knowledge, OPQ is the first work that reveals pre-trained model is sufficient for solving pruning and quantization simultaneously, without any complex iterative/manual optimization at the finetuning stage. Furthermore, we propose a unified channel-wise quantization method that enforces all channels of each layer to share a common codebook, which leads to low bit-rate allocation without introducing extra overhead brought by traditional channel-wise quantization.

Pruning tasks with a low probability of meeting their deadlines improves the likelihood of other tasks meeting their deadlines, thereby increasing system robustness and overall QoS. To evaluate the impact of the pruning mechanism, we examine it on various configurations of heterogeneous and homogeneous computing systems.

An important part of the output volume in social sciences appears as books, book chapters and national literature (Hicks, 2004). To proceed from publication data to performance measurement, quantitative publication counts need to be combined with qualitative information, for example from peer assessment or validation (European Expert Group on Assessment of University-Based Research, 2010), to identify those categories that represent research quality as perceived by peers. An accurate focus is crucial in order to stimulate, recognize and reward high quality achievements only. This paper demonstrates how such a selection of publication categories can be based on correlations with peer judgments. It is also illustrated that the selection should be sufficiently precise, to avoid subcategories negatively correlated with peer judgments. The findings indicate that, also in social sciences and humanities, publications in journals with an international referee system are the most important category for evaluating quality. Book chapters with international referee system and contributions in international conference proceedings follow them."}

However, recent studies have shown that retrieving relevant data for data reuse is a time-consuming task in daily research practice. In this study, we explore what hampers dataset retrieval in biodiversity research, a field that produces a large amount of heterogeneous data. We analyze the primary source in dataset search - metadata - and determine if they reflect scholarly search interests. We examine if metadata standards provide elements corresponding to search interests, we inspect if selected data repositories use metadata standards representing scholarly interests, and we determine how many fields of the metadata standards used are filled. To determine search interests in biodiversity research, we gathered 169 questions that researchers aimed to answer with the help of retrieved data, identified biological entities and grouped them into 13 categories. Our findings indicate that environments, materials and chemicals, species, biological and chemical processes, locations, data parameters and data types are important search interests in biodiversity research. The comparison with existing metadata standards shows that domain-specific standards cover search interests quite well, whereas general standards do not explicitly contain elements that reflect search interests. We inspect metadata from five large data repositories. Our results confirm that metadata currently poorly reflect search interests in biodiversity research. From these findings, we derive recommendations for researchers and data repositories how to bridge the gap between search interest and metadata provided."}

Poorly formulated questions can lead to user frustration and confusion, negatively affecting the system's performance. This research addresses the urgent need to identify and leverage key features that contribute to the classification of clarifying questions, enhancing user satisfaction. To gain deeper insights into how different features influence user satisfaction, we conduct a comprehensive analysis, considering a broad spectrum of lexical, semantic, and statistical features, such as question length and sentiment polarity. Our empirical results provide three main insights into the qualities of effective query clarification: (1) specific questions are more effective than generic ones; (2) the subjectivity and emotional tone of a question play a role; and (3) shorter and more ambiguous queries benefit significantly from clarification. Based on these insights, we implement feature-integrated user satisfaction prediction using various classifiers, both traditional and neural-based, including random forest, BERT, and large language models. Our experiments show a consistent and significant improvement, particularly in traditional classifiers, with a minimum performance boost of 45\\%. This study presents invaluable guidelines for refining the formulation of clarifying questions and enhancing both user satisfaction and system performance."}

Machine learning models that attempt to predict outcomes from survey data under these conditions can overfit and result in poor generalizability. One remedy to this issue is feature selection, which attempts to select an optimal subset of features to learn upon. A relatively unexplored source of information in the feature selection process is the usage of textual names of features, which may be semantically indicative of which features are relevant to a target outcome. The relationships between feature names and target names can be evaluated using language models (LMs) to produce semantic textual similarity (STS) scores, which can then be used to select features. We examine the performance using STS to select features directly and in the minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance (mRMR) algorithm. The performance of STS as a feature selection metric is evaluated against preliminary survey data collected as a part of a clinical study on persistent post-surgical pain (PPSP). The results suggest that features selected with STS can result in higher performance models compared to traditional feature selection algorithms."}

Although the primary goal of traditional recommendation systems is to deliver the most relevant items, such an effort unintentionally can cause collateral effects including low diversity and unbalanced genres or categories, benefiting particular groups of categories. This paper proposes an approach to create recommendation lists with a calibrated balance of genres, avoiding disproportion between the user's profile interests and the recommendation list. The calibrated recommendations consider concomitantly the relevance and the divergence between the genres distributions extracted from the user's preference and the recommendation list. The main claim is that calibration can contribute positively to generate fairer recommendations. In particular, we propose a new trade-off equation, which considers the users' bias to provide a recommendation list that seeks for the users' tendencies. Moreover, we propose a conceptual framework and a decision protocol to generate more than one thousand combinations of calibrated systems in order to find the best combination. We compare our approach against state-of-the-art approaches using multiple domain datasets, which are analyzed by rank and calibration metrics. The results indicate that the trade-off, which considers the users' bias, produces positive effects on the precision and to the fairness, thus generating recommendation lists that respect the genre distribution and, through the decision protocol, we also found the best system for each dataset."}

In the field of statistics, current studies of citation data have mostly focused on the interactions between statistical journals and papers, limiting the measure of influence to mainly within statistics itself. In this paper, we take the first step towards understanding the impact statistics has made on other scientific fields in the era of Big Data. By collecting comprehensive bibliometric data from the Web of Science database for selected statistical journals, we investigate the citation trends and compositions of citing fields over time to show that their diversity has been increasing. Furthermore, we use the local clustering technique involving personalized PageRank with conductance for size selection to find the most relevant statistical research area for a given external topic of interest. We provide theoretical guarantees for the procedure and, through a number of case studies, show the results from our citation data align well with our knowledge and intuition about these external topics. Overall, we have found that the statistical theory and methods recently invented by the statistics community have made increasing impact on other scientific fields."}

While such ways of breaking down the research space can be useful, we put forward several concerns about the near/long-term distinction gaining too much prominence in how research questions and priorities are framed. We highlight some ambiguities and inconsistencies in how the distinction is used, and argue that while there are differing priorities within this broad research community, these differences are not well-captured by the near/long-term distinction. We unpack the near/long-term distinction into four different dimensions, and propose some ways that researchers can communicate more clearly about their work and priorities using these dimensions. We suggest that moving towards a more nuanced conversation about research priorities can help establish new opportunities for collaboration, aid the development of more consistent and coherent research agendas, and enable identification of previously neglected research areas."}

Numerous benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate the ability of LLMs for scientific research. However, current benchmarks are mostly based on pre-collected objective questions. This design suffers from data leakage problem and lacks the evaluation of subjective Q/A ability. In this paper, we propose SciEval, a comprehensive and multi-disciplinary evaluation benchmark to address these issues. Based on Bloom's taxonomy, SciEval covers four dimensions to systematically evaluate scientific research ability. In particular, we design a \"dynamic\" subset based on scientific principles to prevent evaluation from potential data leakage. Both objective and subjective questions are included in SciEval. These characteristics make SciEval a more effective benchmark for scientific research ability evaluation of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments on most advanced LLMs show that, although GPT-4 achieves SOTA performance compared to other LLMs, there is still substantial room for improvement, especially for dynamic questions. The codes and data are publicly available on https://github.com/OpenDFM/SciEval."}

Yet, its sensitivity criterion has since been criticized for not propagating training signal properly or even disconnecting layers. As a remedy, GraSP [arXiv:2002.07376v1] was introduced, compromising on simplicity. However, in this work we show that by applying the sensitivity criterion iteratively in smaller steps - still before training - we can improve its performance without difficult implementation. As such, we introduce 'SNIP-it'. We then demonstrate how it can be applied for both structured and unstructured pruning, before and/or during training, therewith achieving state-of-the-art sparsity-performance trade-offs. That is, while already providing the computational benefits of pruning in the training process from the start. Furthermore, we evaluate our methods on robustness to overfitting, disconnection and adversarial attacks as well."}

Commonly, these robots rely on edge infrastructure accessible over wireless communication to execute heavy computational complex tasks. However, the edge might become unavailable and, consequently, oblige the execution of the tasks on the robot. This work focuses on making it possible to execute the tasks on the robots by reducing the complexity and the total number of parameters of pre-trained computer vision models. This is achieved by using model compression techniques such as Pruning and Knowledge Distillation. These compression techniques have strong theoretical and practical foundations, but their combined usage has not been widely explored in the literature. Therefore, this work especially focuses on investigating the effects of combining these two compression techniques. The results of this work reveal that up to 90% of the total number of parameters of a computer vision model can be removed without any considerable reduction in the model's accuracy."}

With the growth of online text data, numerous summarization models have been proposed recently. The Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) based neural summarization model is the most widely used in the summarization field due to its high performance. This is because semantic information and structure information in the text is adequately considered when encoding. However, the existing extractive summarization models pay little attention to and use the central topic information to assist the generation of summaries, which leads to models not ensuring the generated summary under the primary topic. A lengthy document can span several topics, and a single summary cannot do justice to all the topics. Therefore, the key to generating a high-quality summary is determining the central topic and building a summary based on it, especially for a long document. We propose a topic-aware encoding for document summarization to deal with this issue. This model effectively combines syntactic-level and topic-level information to build a comprehensive sentence representation. Specifically, a neural topic model is added in the neural-based sentence-level representation learning to adequately consider the central topic information for capturing the critical content in the original document. The experimental results on three public datasets show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art models."}

We construct a novel dataset for focus, coverage, and inter-sentential coherence, and develop automatic methods for evaluating each of the four dimensions of FFCI based on cross-comparison of evaluation metrics and model-based evaluation methods, including question answering (QA) approaches, semantic textual similarity (STS), next-sentence prediction (NSP), and scores derived from 19 pre-trained language models. We then apply the developed metrics in evaluating a broad range of summarization models across two datasets, with some surprising findings."}

To reduce the FLOPs, structure pruning is a popular approach to remove the entire hidden structures via introducing coarse-grained sparsity. Meanwhile, plentiful pruning works leverage fine-grained sparsity instead (sparsity are randomly distributed), whereas their sparse models lack special designed computing library for potential speedup. In this technical report, we study and present an efficient convolution neural network inference system to accelerate its forward pass by utilizing the fine-grained sparsity of compressed CNNs. Our developed FSCNN is established based on a set of specialized designed sparse data structures, operators and associated algorithms. Experimentally, we validate that FSCNN outperforms standard deep learning library PyTorch on popular CNN architectures such as VGG16 if sufficiently high sparsity exhibits. However, due to the contiguity issue of sparse operators, FSCNN is typically not comparable with highly optimized dense operator. Therefore, coarse-grained (structured) sparsity is our recommendation for generic model compression."}

Early approaches prune weights individually. However, it is difficult to take advantage of the resulting unstructured sparsity patterns on modern hardware like GPUs. As a result, pruning strategies which impose sparsity structures in the weights have become more popular. However,these structured pruning approaches typically lead to higher losses in accuracy than unstructured pruning. In this paper, we present SparseRT, a code generator that leverage unstructured sparsity to accelerate sparse linear algebra operations in deep learning inference on GPUs. For 1x1 convolutions and fully connected layers, we demonstrate geometric mean of speedups of 3.4x over the equivalent dense computation at 90% sparsity and 5.4x at 95% sparsity when evaluated on hundreds of test cases in deep learning. For sparse 3x3 convolutions, we show speedups of over 5x on use cases in ResNet-50."}

Practical pruning methods, thus, usually lower pruning rates (by structured pruning) to improve parallelism. In this paper, we study fixed-to-fixed (lossless) encoding architecture/algorithm to support fine-grained pruning methods such that sparse neural networks can be stored in a highly regular structure. We first estimate the maximum compression ratio of encoding-based compression using entropy. Then, as an effort to push the compression ratio to the theoretical maximum (by entropy), we propose a sequential fixed-to-fixed encoding scheme. We demonstrate that our proposed compression scheme achieves almost the maximum compression ratio for the Transformer and ResNet-50 pruned by various fine-grained pruning methods."}

However, operationalizing those benefits and understanding the end-to-end effect of algorithm design and regularization on the runtime execution is not often examined in depth. Here we apply structured and unstructured pruning to attention weights of transformer blocks of the BERT language model, while also expanding block sparse representation (BSR) operations in the TVM compiler. Integration of BSR operations enables the TVM runtime execution to leverage structured pattern sparsity induced by model regularization. This integrated view of pruning algorithms enables us to study relationships between modeling decisions and their direct impact on sparsity-enhanced execution. Our main findings are: 1) we validate that performance benefits of structured sparsity block regularization must be enabled by the BSR augmentations to TVM, with 4x speedup relative to vanilla PyTorch and 2.2x speedup relative to standard TVM compilation (without expanded BSR support). 2) for BERT attention weights, the end-to-end optimal block sparsity shape in this CPU inference context is not a square block (as in \\cite{gray2017gpu}) but rather a linear 32x1 block 3) the relationship between performance and block size / shape is is suggestive of how model regularization parameters interact with task scheduler optimizations resulting in the observed end-to-end performance."}

For example, employing deep neural networks on mobile systems requires the design of accurate yet fast CNN for low latency in classification and object detection. To fulfill the need, we aim at obtaining CNN models with both high testing accuracy and small size to address resource constraints in many embedded devices. In particular, this paper focuses on proposing a generic reinforcement learning-based model compression approach in a two-stage compression pipeline: pruning and quantization. The first stage of compression, i.e., pruning, is achieved via exploiting deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to co-learn the accuracy and the FLOPs updated after layer-wise channel pruning and element-wise variational pruning via information dropout. The second stage, i.e., quantization, is achieved via a similar DRL approach but focuses on obtaining the optimal bits representation for individual layers. We further conduct experimental results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. For the CIFAR-10 dataset, the proposed method can reduce the size of VGGNet by 9x from 20.04MB to 2.2MB with a slight accuracy increase. For the ImageNet dataset, the proposed method can reduce the size of VGG-16 by 33x from 138MB to 4.14MB with no accuracy loss."}

Thus, dense models trained via CrAM should be compressible post-training, in a single step, without significant accuracy loss. Experimental results on standard benchmarks, such as residual networks for ImageNet classification and BERT models for language modelling, show that CrAM produces dense models that can be more accurate than the standard SGD/Adam-based baselines, but which are stable under weight pruning: specifically, we can prune models in one-shot to 70-80% sparsity with almost no accuracy loss, and to 90% with reasonable ($\\sim 1\\%$) accuracy loss, which is competitive with gradual compression methods. Additionally, CrAM can produce sparse models which perform well for transfer learning, and it also works for semi-structured 2:4 pruning patterns supported by GPU hardware.

We collect target summaries from more than seven thousand survey papers and utilize their 430 thousand reference papers' abstracts as input documents.

We validate this hypothesis by incorporating representations from a Siamese BERT model fine-tuned on NLI and Multi-NLI datasets into our models and demonstrate that our best performing model obtains a relative performance improvement of 40 percent and 60 percent respectively (on the key metric of Precision@1), over the state-of-the-art baseline(s) on the two evaluation sets of the StackExchange dataset, thereby, significantly surpassing the state-of-the-art."}

Principal among these figures are the number of visualized publications, publication types, languages, and the maximum and minimum h5-index and h5-median values by language, subject area, and subcategory. This new edition is marked by continuity. There is nothing new other than the updating of the time frame (2009-2013) and the removal of some redundant subcategories (from 268 to 261) for English written publications. Google has just updated the data, which means that some of the errors discussed in previous studies still persist. To sum up, GSM is a minimalist information product with few features, closed (it cannot be customized by the user), and simple (navigating it only takes a few clicks). For these reasons, we consider it a 'low cost' bibliometric tool, and propose a list of features it should incorporate in order to stop being labeled as such.

Efficient and standardized procedures are necessary to assign meaningful metadata; enable user-friendly retrieval; and provide the opportunity to derive reports, statistics, and visualizations to impart a deeper understanding of the research output. In 2021, a group of observatory bibliographers from around the world convened online to continue the discussions presented in Lagerstrom (2015).

This paper briefly describes the methodologies employed in constructing databases, along with the various bibliometric techniques used to analyze and interpret them. We explain reasons for non-standardization and why it is essential for each observatory to identify metadata and metrics that are meaningful for them; caution the (over-)use of comparisons among facilities that are, ultimately, not comparable through bibliometrics; and highlight the benefits of telescope bibliographies, both for researchers within the astronomical community and for stakeholders beyond the specific observatories.

{"id": "229", "arxiv": "2207.01209v1", "title": "Sustainable AI Processing at the Edge", "abstract": "Edge computing is a popular target for accelerating machine learning algorithms supporting mobile devices without requiring the communication latencies to handle them in the cloud. Edge deployments of machine learning primarily consider traditional concerns such as SWaP constraints (Size, Weight, and Power) for their installations. However, such metrics are not entirely sufficient to consider environmental impacts from computing given the significant contributions from embodied energy and carbon. In this paper we explore the tradeoffs of convolutional neural network acceleration engines for both inference and on-line training. In particular, we explore the use of processing-in-memory (PIM) approaches, mobile GPU accelerators, and recently released FPGAs, and compare them with novel Racetrack memory PIM. Replacing PIM-enabled DDR3 with Racetrack memory PIM can recover its embodied energy as quickly as 1 year. For high activity ratios, mobile GPUs can be more sustainable but have higher embodied energy to overcome compared to PIM-enabled Racetrack memory."}

However, the continuous publication of new primary and secondary studies following the release of a tertiary study can make the communication of results not integrally representative in regards to the advances achieved by that time. Consequently, using such a study as a reference within specific bodies of knowledge may introduce imprecision, both in terms of its subareas and with respect to new methodologies, languages, and tools. Thus, a review of tertiary studies (what could be understood as a quaternary study) could contribute to show the representativeness of the reported findings in comparison to the state of the art and also to compile a set of perceptions that could not be previously achieved. In that direction, the main contribution of this paper is presenting the findings from an analysis of 34 software engineering tertiary studies published between 2009 and 2021. The results indicate that over 60% of the studies demonstrate varying degrees of anachronism due to the publication of primary and secondary studies following the publication of the tertiary study or even due to a time elapse between its conduction and its publication."}
{"id": "231", "arxiv": "2312.16904v2", "title": "Block Pruning for Enhanced Efficiency in Convolutional Neural Networks", "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to network pruning, targeting block pruning in deep neural networks for edge computing environments. Our method diverges from traditional techniques that utilize proxy metrics, instead employing a direct block removal strategy to assess the impact on classification accuracy. This hands-on approach allows for an accurate evaluation of each block's importance. We conducted extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets using ResNet architectures. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of our method, particularly on large-scale datasets like ImageNet with ResNet50, where it excelled in reducing model size while retaining high accuracy, even when pruning a significant portion of the network. The findings underscore our method's capability in maintaining an optimal balance between model size and performance, especially in resource-constrained edge computing scenarios."}
{"id": "232", "arxiv": "2009.09940v1", "title": "CNNPruner: Pruning Convolutional Neural Networks with Visual Analytics", "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated extraordinarily good performance in many computer vision tasks. The increasing size of CNN models, however, prevents them from being widely deployed to devices with limited computational resources, e.g., mobile/embedded devices. The emerging topic of model pruning strives to address this problem by removing less important neurons and fine-tuning the pruned networks to minimize the accuracy loss. Nevertheless, existing automated pruning solutions often rely on a numerical threshold of the pruning criteria, lacking the flexibility to optimally balance the trade-off between model size and accuracy. Moreover, the complicated interplay between the stages of neuron pruning and model fine-tuning makes this process opaque, and therefore becomes difficult to optimize. In this paper, we address these challenges through a visual analytics approach, named CNNPruner. It considers the importance of convolutional filters through both instability and sensitivity, and allows users to interactively create pruning plans according to a desired goal on model size or accuracy. Also, CNNPruner integrates state-of-the-art filter visualization techniques to help users understand the roles that different filters played and refine their pruning plans. Through comprehensive case studies on CNNs with real-world sizes, we validate the effectiveness of CNNPruner."}

However, existing model-compression methods often rely on human expertise and focus on parameters' local importance, ignoring the rich topology information within DNNs. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-stage graph embedding technique based on graph neural networks (GNNs) to identify DNN topologies and use reinforcement learning (RL) to find a suitable compression policy. We performed resource-constrained (i.e., FLOPs) channel pruning and compared our approach with state-of-the-art model compression methods. We evaluated our method on various models from typical to mobile-friendly networks, such as ResNet family, VGG-16, MobileNet-v1/v2, and ShuffleNet. Results show that our method can achieve higher compression ratios with a minimal fine-tuning cost yet yields outstanding and competitive performance."}
{"id": "234", "arxiv": "1910.05897v4", "title": "Automatic Neural Network Compression by Sparsity-Quantization Joint Learning: A Constrained Optimization-based Approach", "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are applied in a wide range of usecases. There is an increased demand for deploying DNNs on devices that do not have abundant resources such as memory and computation units. Recently, network compression through a variety of techniques such as pruning and quantization have been proposed to reduce the resource requirement. A key parameter that all existing compression techniques are sensitive to is the compression ratio (e.g., pruning sparsity, quantization bitwidth) of each layer. Traditional solutions treat the compression ratios of each layer as hyper-parameters, and tune them using human heuristic. Recent researchers start using black-box hyper-parameter optimizations, but they will introduce new hyper-parameters and have efficiency issue. In this paper, we propose a framework to jointly prune and quantize the DNNs automatically according to a target model size without using any hyper-parameters to manually set the compression ratio for each layer. In the experiments, we show that our framework can compress the weights data of ResNet-50 to be 836$\\times$ smaller without accuracy loss on CIFAR-10, and compress AlexNet to be 205$\\times$ smaller without accuracy loss on ImageNet classification."}
{"id": "235", "arxiv": "2008.09072v1", "title": "Utilizing Explainable AI for Quantization and Pruning of Deep Neural Networks", "abstract": "For many applications, utilizing DNNs (Deep Neural Networks) requires their implementation on a target architecture in an optimized manner concerning energy consumption, memory requirement, throughput, etc. DNN compression is used to reduce the memory footprint and complexity of a DNN before its deployment on hardware. Recent efforts to understand and explain AI (Artificial Intelligence) methods have led to a new research area, termed as explainable AI. Explainable AI methods allow us to understand better the inner working of DNNs, such as the importance of different neurons and features. The concepts from explainable AI provide an opportunity to improve DNN compression methods such as quantization and pruning in several ways that have not been sufficiently explored so far. In this paper, we utilize explainable AI methods: mainly DeepLIFT method. We use these methods for (1) pruning of DNNs; this includes structured and unstructured pruning of \\ac{CNN} filters pruning as well as pruning weights of fully connected layers, (2) non-uniform quantization of DNN weights using clustering algorithm; this is also referred to as Weight Sharing, and (3) integer-based mixed-precision quantization; this is where each layer of a DNN may use a different number of integer bits. We use typical image classification datasets with common deep learning image classification models for evaluation. In all these three cases, we demonstrate significant improvements as well as new insights and opportunities from the use of explainable AI in DNN compression."}
{"id": "236", "arxiv": "2210.06659v2", "title": "Structural Pruning via Latency-Saliency Knapsack", "abstract": "Structural pruning can simplify network architecture and improve inference speed. We propose Hardware-Aware Latency Pruning (HALP) that formulates structural pruning as a global resource allocation optimization problem, aiming at maximizing the accuracy while constraining latency under a predefined budget on targeting device. For filter importance ranking, HALP leverages latency lookup table to track latency reduction potential and global saliency score to gauge accuracy drop. Both metrics can be evaluated very efficiently during pruning, allowing us to reformulate global structural pruning under a reward maximization problem given target constraint. This makes the problem solvable via our augmented knapsack solver, enabling HALP to surpass prior work in pruning efficacy and accuracy-efficiency trade-off. We examine HALP on both classification and detection tasks, over varying networks, on ImageNet and VOC datasets, on different platforms. In particular, for ResNet-50/-101 pruning on ImageNet, HALP improves network throughput by $1.60\\times$/$1.90\\times$ with $+0.3\\%$/$-0.2\\%$ top-1 accuracy changes, respectively. For SSD pruning on VOC, HALP improves throughput by $1.94\\times$ with only a $0.56$ mAP drop. HALP consistently outperforms prior art, sometimes by large margins.

{"id": "237", "arxiv": "2304.13039v1", "title": "Optimizing Deep Learning Models For Raspberry Pi", "abstract": "Deep learning models have become increasingly popular for a wide range of applications, including computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. However, these models typically require large amounts of computational resources, making them challenging to run on low-power devices such as the Raspberry Pi. One approach to addressing this challenge is to use pruning techniques to reduce the size of the deep learning models. Pruning involves removing unimportant weights and connections from the model, resulting in a smaller and more efficient model. Pruning can be done during training or after the model has been trained. Another approach is to optimize the deep learning models specifically for the Raspberry Pi architecture. This can include optimizing the model's architecture and parameters to take advantage of the Raspberry Pi's hardware capabilities, such as its CPU and GPU. Additionally, the model can be optimized for energy efficiency by minimizing the amount of computation required. Pruning and optimizing deep learning models for the Raspberry Pi can help overcome the computational and energy constraints of low-power devices, making it possible to run deep learning models on a wider range of devices. In the following sections, we will explore these approaches in more detail and discuss their effectiveness for optimizing deep learning models for the Raspberry Pi."}
{"id": "238", "arxiv": "2103.10858v2", "title": "Toward Compact Deep Neural Networks via Energy-Aware Pruning", "abstract": "Despite the remarkable performance, modern deep neural networks are inevitably accompanied by a significant amount of computational cost for learning and deployment, which may be incompatible with their usage on edge devices. Recent efforts to reduce these overheads involve pruning and decomposing the parameters of various layers without performance deterioration. Inspired by several decomposition studies, in this paper, we propose a novel energy-aware pruning method that quantifies the importance of each filter in the network using nuclear-norm (NN). Proposed energy-aware pruning leads to state-of-the-art performance for Top-1 accuracy, FLOPs, and parameter reduction across a wide range of scenarios with multiple network architectures on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet after fine-grained classification tasks. On toy experiment, without fine-tuning, we can visually observe that NN has a minute change in decision boundaries across classes and outperforms the previous popular criteria. We achieve competitive results with 40.4/49.8% of FLOPs and 45.9/52.9% of parameter reduction with 94.13/94.61% in the Top-1 accuracy with ResNet-56/110 on CIFAR-10, respectively. In addition, our observations are consistent for a variety of different pruning setting in terms of data size as well as data quality which can be emphasized in the stability of the acceleration and compression with negligible accuracy loss."}
{"id": "239", "arxiv": "2312.15747v1", "title": "A Comparison of Image and Scalar-Based Approaches in Preconditioner Selection", "abstract": "Within high-performance computing (HPC), solving large sparse linear systems efficiently remains paramount, with iterative methods being the predominant choice. However, the performance of these methods is tightly coupled to the aptness of the chosen preconditioner. The multifaceted nature of sparse matrices makes the universal prescription of preconditioners elusive. Notably, the key attribute of sparsity is not precisely captured by scalar metrics such as bandwidth or matrix dimensions. Advancing prior methodologies, this research introduces matrix sparsity depiction via RGB images. Utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN), the task of preconditioner selection turns into a multi-class classification problem. Extensive tests on 126 SuiteSparse matrices emphasize the enhanced prowess of the CNN model, noting a 32% boost in accuracy and a 25% reduction in computational slowdown."}

Large-scale systems are currently equipped with multiple GPU accelerators per compute node and are expected to incorporate more specialized hardware in the future. This shift in the computing ecosystem offers many opportunities for performance improvement; however, it also increases the complexity of programming for such architectures. This work introduces a runtime framework that enables effortless programming for heterogeneous systems while efficiently utilizing hardware resources. The framework is integrated within a distributed and scalable runtime system to facilitate performance portability across heterogeneous nodes. Along with the design, this paper describes the implementation and optimizations performed, achieving up to 300% improvement in a shared memory benchmark and up to 10 times in distributed device communication. Preliminary results indicate that our software incurs low overhead and achieves 40% improvement in a distributed Jacobi proxy application while hiding the idiosyncrasies of the hardware."}

{"id": "242", "arxiv": "2309.06973v1", "title": "DNNShifter: An Efficient DNN Pruning System for Edge Computing", "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) underpin many machine learning applications. Production quality DNN models achieve high inference accuracy by training millions of DNN parameters which has a significant resource footprint. This presents a challenge for resources operating at the extreme edge of the network, such as mobile and embedded devices that have limited computational and memory resources. To address this, models are pruned to create lightweight, more suitable variants for these devices. Existing pruning methods are unable to provide similar quality models compared to their unpruned counterparts without significant time costs and overheads or are limited to offline use cases. Our work rapidly derives suitable model variants while maintaining the accuracy of the original model. The model variants can be swapped quickly when system and network conditions change to match workload demand. This paper presents DNNShifter, an end-to-end DNN training, spatial pruning, and model switching system that addresses the challenges mentioned above. At the heart of DNNShifter is a novel methodology that prunes sparse models using structured pruning. The pruned model variants generated by DNNShifter are smaller in size and thus faster than dense and sparse model predecessors, making them suitable for inference at the edge while retaining near similar accuracy as of the original dense model. DNNShifter generates a portfolio of model variants that can be swiftly interchanged depending on operational conditions. DNNShifter produces pruned model variants up to 93x faster than conventional training methods. Compared to sparse models, the pruned model variants are up to 5.14x smaller and have a 1.67x inference latency speedup, with no compromise to sparse model accuracy. In addition, DNNShifter has up to 11.9x lower overhead for switching models and up to 3.8x lower memory utilisation than existing approaches."}
{"id": "243", "arxiv": "2012.06959v1", "title": "Fast and Scalable Sparse Triangular Solver for Multi-GPU Based HPC Architectures", "abstract": "Designing efficient and scalable sparse linear algebra kernels on modern multi-GPU based HPC systems is a daunting task due to significant irregular memory references and workload imbalance across the GPUs. This is particularly the case for Sparse Triangular Solver (SpTRSV) which introduces additional two-dimensional computation dependencies among subsequent computation steps. Dependency information is exchanged and shared among GPUs, thus warrant for efficient memory allocation, data partitioning, and workload distribution as well as fine-grained communication and synchronization support. In this work, we demonstrate that directly adopting unified memory can adversely affect the performance of SpTRSV on multi-GPU architectures, despite linking via fast interconnect like NVLinks and NVSwitches. Alternatively, we employ the latest NVSHMEM technology based on Partitioned Global Address Space programming model to enable efficient fine-grained communication and drastic synchronization overhead reduction. Furthermore, to handle workload imbalance, we propose a malleable task-pool execution model which can further enhance the utilization of GPUs. By applying these techniques, our experiments on the NVIDIA multi-GPU supernode V100-DGX-1 and DGX-2 systems demonstrate that our design can achieve on average 3.53x (up to 9.86x) speedup on a DGX-1 system and 3.66x (up to 9.64x) speedup on a DGX-2 system with 4-GPUs over the Unified-Memory design. The comprehensive sensitivity and scalability studies also show that the proposed zero-copy SpTRSV is able to fully utilize the computing and communication resources of the multi-GPU system."}
