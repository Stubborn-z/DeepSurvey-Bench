This remarkable progress has sparked interest in applying deep networks to real-world applications, such as autonomous vehicles, mobile devices, robotics, and edge computing. However, the challenge remains that state-of-the-art models usually demand significant computational resources, leading to impractical power consumption, latency, or carbon emissions in real-world scenarios. This trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency has catalyzed the emergence of a new research focus: computationally efficient deep learning, which strives to achieve satisfactory performance while minimizing the computational cost during inference. This review offers an extensive analysis of this rapidly evolving field by examining four key areas: 1) the development of static or dynamic light-weighted backbone models for the efficient extraction of discriminative deep representations; 2) the specialized network architectures or algorithms tailored for specific computer vision tasks; 3) the techniques employed for compressing deep learning models; and 4) the strategies for deploying efficient deep networks on hardware platforms. Additionally, we provide a systematic discussion on the critical challenges faced in this domain, such as network architecture design, training schemes, practical efficiency, and more realistic model compression approaches, as well as potential future research directions."}

However, their superior performance comes at the considerable cost of computational complexity, which greatly hinders their applications in many resource-constrained devices, such as mobile phones and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Therefore, methods and techniques that are able to lift the efficiency bottleneck while preserving the high accuracy of DNNs are in great demand in order to enable numerous edge AI applications. This paper provides an overview of efficient deep learning methods, systems and applications. We start from introducing popular model compression methods, including pruning, factorization, quantization as well as compact model design. To reduce the large design cost of these manual solutions, we discuss the AutoML framework for each of them, such as neural architecture search (NAS) and automated pruning and quantization. We then cover efficient on-device training to enable user customization based on the local data on mobile devices. Apart from general acceleration techniques, we also showcase several task-specific accelerations for point cloud, video and natural language processing by exploiting their spatial sparsity and temporal/token redundancy. Finally, to support all these algorithmic advancements, we introduce the efficient deep learning system design from both software and hardware perspectives."}

One of the main challenges for the long tail of researchers who might have only limited resources (e.g., a single multi-GPU server) is limited GPU memory capacity compared to model size. The problem is so acute that the memory requirement of training massive DNN models can often exceed the aggregate capacity of all available GPUs on a single server; this problem only gets worse with the trend of ever-growing model sizes. Current solutions that rely on virtualizing GPU memory (by swapping to/from CPU memory) incur excessive swapping overhead. In this paper, we present a new training framework, Harmony, and advocate rethinking how DNN frameworks schedule computation and move data to push the boundaries of training massive models efficiently on a single commodity server. Across various massive DNN models, Harmony is able to reduce swap load by up to two orders of magnitude and obtain a training throughput speedup of up to 7.6x over highly optimized baselines with virtualized memory."}

The high complexity of DL models and its widespread adoption has led to global energy consumption doubling every 3-4 months. Currently, the relationship between the DL model configuration and energy consumption is not well established. At a general computational energy model level, there is both strong dependency to both the hardware architecture (e.g. generic processors with different configuration of inner components- CPU and GPU, programmable integrated circuits - FPGA), as well as different interacting energy consumption aspects (e.g., data movement, calculation, control). At the DL model level, we need to translate non-linear activation functions and its interaction with data into calculation tasks. Current methods mainly linearize nonlinear DL models to approximate its theoretical FLOPs and MACs as a proxy for energy consumption. Yet, this is inaccurate (est. 93\\% accuracy) due to the highly nonlinear nature of many convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for example. In this paper, we develop a bottom-level Transistor Operations (TOs) method to expose the role of non-linear activation functions and neural network structure in energy consumption. We translate a range of feedforward and CNN models into ALU calculation tasks and then TO steps. This is then statistically linked to real energy consumption values via a regression model for different hardware configurations and data sets. We show that our proposed TOs method can achieve a 93.61% - 99.51% precision in predicting its energy consumption."}

For example, training a DNN requires high dynamic memory, a large-scale dataset, and a large number of computations (a long training time); even inference with a DNN also demands a large amount of static storage, computations (a long inference time), and energy. Therefore, state-of-the-art DNNs are often deployed on a cloud server with a large number of super-computers, a high-bandwidth communication bus, a shared storage infrastructure, and a high power supplement. Recently, some new emerging intelligent applications, e.g., AR/VR, mobile assistants, Internet of Things, require us to deploy DNNs on resource-constrained edge devices. Compare to a cloud server, edge devices often have a rather small amount of resources. To deploy DNNs on edge devices, we need to reduce the size of DNNs, i.e., we target a better trade-off between resource consumption and model accuracy. In this dissertation, we studied four edge intelligence scenarios, i.e., Inference on Edge Devices, Adaptation on Edge Devices, Learning on Edge Devices, and Edge-Server Systems, and developed different methodologies to enable deep learning in each scenario. Since current DNNs are often over-parameterized, our goal is to find and reduce the redundancy of the DNNs in each scenario."}

During the past five years, tremendous progress has been made in this area. In this paper, we review the recent techniques for compacting and accelerating DNN models. In general, these techniques are divided into four categories: parameter pruning and quantization, low-rank factorization, transferred/compact convolutional filters, and knowledge distillation. Methods of parameter pruning and quantization are described first, after that the other techniques are introduced. For each category, we also provide insightful analysis about the performance, related applications, advantages, and drawbacks. Then we go through some very recent successful methods, for example, dynamic capacity networks and stochastic depths networks. After that, we survey the evaluation matrices, the main datasets used for evaluating the model performance, and recent benchmark efforts.

This objective generalizes many of the compression techniques proposed in the literature, in that pruning or reducing the cardinality of the weight elements of the network can be seen special cases of entropy-minimization techniques. Furthermore, we derive a continuous relaxation of the objective, which allows us to minimize it using gradient based optimization techniques.

We demonstrate experimentally the ability of deep neural networks to compress the training data even when accounting for parameter encoding. The compression viewpoint originally motivated the use of variational methods in neural networks. Unexpectedly, we found that these variational methods provide surprisingly poor compression bounds, despite being explicitly built to minimize such bounds. This might explain the relatively poor practical performance of variational methods in deep learning.

This success comes at a high cost of computation and storage overhead, which makes machine learning algorithms difficult to deploy on edge devices. Typically, one has to partially sacrifice accuracy in favor of an increased performance quantified in terms of reduced memory usage and energy consumption. Current methods compress the networks by reducing the precision of the parameters or by eliminating redundant ones. In this paper, we propose a new insight into network compression through the Bayesian framework. We show that Bayesian neural networks automatically discover redundancy in model parameters, thus enabling self-compression, which is linked to the propagation of uncertainty through the layers of the network. Our experimental results show that the network architecture can be successfully compressed by deleting parameters identified by the network itself while retaining the same level of accuracy."}

Moreover, we show that the prediction performance strictly decreases as the compression gets stronger during optimizing the IB Lagrangian. In this paper, we implement the IB method from the perspective of supervised disentangling. Specifically, we introduce Disentangled Information Bottleneck (DisenIB) that is consistent on compressing source maximally without target prediction performance loss (maximum compression).

{"id": "17", "arxiv": "1810.05270v2", "title": "Rethinking the Value of Network Pruning", "abstract": "Network pruning is widely used for reducing the heavy inference cost of deep models in low-resource settings. A typical pruning algorithm is a three-stage pipeline, i.e., training (a large model), pruning and fine-tuning. During pruning, according to a certain criterion, redundant weights are pruned and important weights are kept to best preserve the accuracy. In this work, we make several surprising observations which contradict common beliefs. For all state-of-the-art structured pruning algorithms we examined, fine-tuning a pruned model only gives comparable or worse performance than training that model with randomly initialized weights. For pruning algorithms which assume a predefined target network architecture, one can get rid of the full pipeline and directly train the target network from scratch. Our observations are consistent for multiple network architectures, datasets, and tasks, which imply that: 1) training a large, over-parameterized model is often not necessary to obtain an efficient final model, 2) learned \"important\" weights of the large model are typically not useful for the small pruned model, 3) the pruned architecture itself, rather than a set of inherited \"important\" weights, is more crucial to the efficiency in the final model, which suggests that in some cases pruning can be useful as an architecture search paradigm. Our results suggest the need for more careful baseline evaluations in future research on structured pruning methods. We also compare with the \"Lottery Ticket Hypothesis\" (Frankle & Carbin 2019), and find that with optimal learning rate, the \"winning ticket\" initialization as used in Frankle & Carbin (2019) does not bring improvement over random initialization."}

However, deploying state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as VGG-16 and ResNets on resource-constrained edge devices is practically infeasible due to their large number of parameters and floating-point operations (FLOPs). Thus, the concept of network pruning as a type of model compression is gaining attention for accelerating CNNs on low-power devices. State-of-the-art pruning approaches, either structured or unstructured do not consider the different underlying nature of complexities being exhibited by convolutional layers and follow a training-pruning-retraining pipeline, which results in additional computational overhead. In this work, we propose a novel and computationally efficient pruning pipeline by exploiting the inherent layer-level complexities of CNNs. Unlike typical methods, our proposed complexity-driven algorithm selects a particular layer for filter-pruning based on its contribution to overall network complexity. We follow a procedure that directly trains the pruned model and avoids the computationally complex ranking and fine-tuning steps. Moreover, we define three modes of pruning, namely parameter-aware (PA), FLOPs-aware (FA), and memory-aware (MA), to introduce versatile compression of CNNs. Our results show the competitive performance of our approach in terms of accuracy and acceleration. Lastly, we present a trade-off between different resources and accuracy which can be helpful for developers in making the right decisions in resource-constrained IoT environments."}

Prevailing pruning algorithms pre-define the width and depth of the pruned networks, and then transfer parameters from the unpruned network to pruned networks. To break the structure limitation of the pruned networks, we propose to apply neural architecture search to search directly for a network with flexible channel and layer sizes. The number of the channels/layers is learned by minimizing the loss of the pruned networks. The feature map of the pruned network is an aggregation of K feature map fragments (generated by K networks of different sizes), which are sampled based on the probability distribution.The loss can be back-propagated not only to the network weights, but also to the parameterized distribution to explicitly tune the size of the channels/layers. Specifically, we apply channel-wise interpolation to keep the feature map with different channel sizes aligned in the aggregation procedure. The maximum probability for the size in each distribution serves as the width and depth of the pruned network, whose parameters are learned by knowledge transfer, e.g., knowledge distillation, from the original networks.

Existing solutions for reducing the computational load of training at inference time usually involve pruning the network parameters. Pruning schemes often create extra overhead either by iterative training and fine-tuning for static pruning or repeated computation of a dynamic pruning graph. We propose a new parameter pruning strategy for learning a lighter-weight sub-network that minimizes the energy cost while maintaining comparable performance to the fully parameterised network on given downstream tasks. Our proposed pruning scheme is green-oriented, as it only requires a one-off training to discover the optimal static sub-networks by dynamic pruning methods. The pruning scheme consists of a binary gating module and a polarizing loss function to uncover sub-networks with user-defined sparsity. Our method enables pruning and training simultaneously, which saves energy in both the training and inference phases and avoids extra computational overhead from gating modules at inference time. Our results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny Imagenet suggest that our scheme can remove 50% of connections in deep networks with <1% reduction in classification accuracy.

Experimentally with deep neural nets, we observe that 1) we can find significantly better models in the error-compression space, indicating that different compression types have complementary benefits, and 2) the best type of combination depends exquisitely on the type of neural net.

We then characterize the increase in empirical risk with model compression using rate distortion theory. These results imply that the population risk could be improved by model compression if the decrease in generalization error exceeds the increase in empirical risk. We show through a linear regression example that such a decrease in population risk due to model compression is indeed possible.

Low precision representations, achieved via quantization of weights and activations, can reduce inference time and memory requirements. However, quantifying and predicting the response of a model to the changes associated with this procedure remains challenging. This response is non-linear and heterogeneous throughout the network. Understanding which groups of parameters and activations are more sensitive to quantization than others is a critical stage in maximizing efficiency. For this purpose, we propose FIT. Motivated by an information geometric perspective, FIT combines the Fisher information with a model of quantization. We find that FIT can estimate the final performance of a network without retraining. FIT effectively fuses contributions from both parameter and activation quantization into a single metric. Additionally, FIT is fast to compute when compared to existing methods, demonstrating favourable convergence properties. These properties are validated experimentally across hundreds of quantization configurations, with a focus on layer-wise mixed-precision quantization."}

However, their ever-increasing size has raised concerns about their effective deployment and the need for LLM compression. This study introduces the Divergent Token Metrics (DTMs), a novel approach to assessing compressed LLMs, addressing the limitations of traditional perplexity or accuracy measures that fail to accurately reflect text generation quality. DTMs measure token divergences that allow deeper insights into the subtleties of model compression, in particular, when evaluating components' impacts individually. Utilizing the First Divergent Token Metric (FDTM) in model sparsification reveals that 25% of all attention components can be pruned beyond 90% on the Llama-2 model family, still keeping SOTA performance. For quantization, FDTM suggests that more than 80% of parameters can be naively transformed to int8 without special outlier management. These evaluations indicate the necessity of choosing appropriate compressions for parameters individually -- and that FDTM can identify those -- while standard metrics result in deteriorated outcomes."}

There is an increased demand for deploying DNNs on devices that do not have abundant resources such as memory and computation units. Recently, network compression through a variety of techniques such as pruning and quantization have been proposed to reduce the resource requirement. A key parameter that all existing compression techniques are sensitive to is the compression ratio (e.g., pruning sparsity, quantization bitwidth) of each layer. Traditional solutions treat the compression ratios of each layer as hyper-parameters, and tune them using human heuristic. Recent researchers start using black-box hyper-parameter optimizations, but they will introduce new hyper-parameters and have efficiency issue. In this paper, we propose a framework to jointly prune and quantize the DNNs automatically according to a target model size without using any hyper-parameters to manually set the compression ratio for each layer. In the experiments, we show that our framework can compress the weights data of ResNet-50 to be 836$\\times$ smaller without accuracy loss on CIFAR-10, and compress AlexNet to be 205$\\times$ smaller without accuracy loss on ImageNet classification."}

To that end, we propose an automated framework to compress DNNs in a hardware-aware manner by jointly employing pruning and quantization. We explore, for the first time, per-layer fine- and coarse-grained pruning, in the same DNN architecture, in addition to low bit-width mixed-precision quantization for weights and activations. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is used to explore the associated design space and identify the pruning-quantization configuration so that the energy consumption is minimized whilst the prediction accuracy loss is retained at acceptable levels. Using our novel composite RL agent we are able to extract energy-efficient solutions without requiring retraining and/or fine tuning.

Nevertheless, as NNs' accuracy increases, it is followed by an expansion in their size, required number of compute operations and energy consumption. Increase in resource consumption results in NNs' reduced adoption rate and real-world deployment impracticality. Therefore, NNs need to be compressed to make them available to a wider audience and at the same time decrease their runtime costs. In this work, we approach this challenge from a causal inference perspective, and we propose a scoring mechanism to facilitate structured pruning of NNs. The approach is based on measuring mutual information under a maximum entropy perturbation, sequentially propagated through the NN. We demonstrate the method's performance on two datasets and various NNs' sizes, and we show that our approach achieves competitive performance under challenging conditions."}

Most existing network pruning methods require laborious human efforts and prohibitive computation resources, especially when the constraints are changed. This practically limits the application of model compression when the model needs to be deployed on a wide range of devices. Besides, existing methods are still challenged by the missing theoretical guidance. In this paper we propose an information theory-inspired strategy for automatic model compression. The principle behind our method is the information bottleneck theory, i.e., the hidden representation should compress information with each other. We thus introduce the normalized Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (nHSIC) on network activations as a stable and generalized indicator of layer importance. When a certain resource constraint is given, we integrate the HSIC indicator with the constraint to transform the architecture search problem into a linear programming problem with quadratic constraints. Such a problem is easily solved by a convex optimization method with a few seconds. We also provide a rigorous proof to reveal that optimizing the normalized HSIC simultaneously minimizes the mutual information between different layers. Without any search process, our method achieves better compression tradeoffs comparing to the state-of-the-art compression algorithms. For instance, with ResNet-50, we achieve a 45.3%-FLOPs reduction, with a 75.75 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. Codes are avaliable at https://github.com/MAC-AutoML/ITPruner/tree/master."}

To prune the network under efficiency constraints, a switchable Efficiency Module is constructed to predict the hardware latency or FLOPs of candidate pruned networks. Combined with the proposed Efficiency Module, W-Gates can perform filter pruning in an efficiency-aware manner and achieve a compact network with a better accuracy-efficiency trade-off.

Both metrics can be evaluated very efficiently during pruning, allowing us to reformulate global structural pruning under a reward maximization problem given target constraint. This makes the problem solvable via our augmented knapsack solver, enabling HALP to surpass prior work in pruning efficacy and accuracy-efficiency trade-off. We examine HALP on both classification and detection tasks, over varying networks, on ImageNet and VOC datasets, on different platforms.

This motivation is particularly relevant given the perhaps surprising observation that a wide variety of pruning approaches increase test accuracy despite sometimes massive reductions in parameter counts. To better understand this phenomenon, we analyze the behavior of pruning over the course of training, finding that pruning's benefit to generalization increases with pruning's instability (defined as the drop in test accuracy immediately following pruning). We demonstrate that this \"generalization-stability tradeoff\" is present across a wide variety of pruning settings and propose a mechanism for its cause: pruning regularizes similarly to noise injection. Supporting this, we find less pruning stability leads to more model flatness and the benefits of pruning do not depend on permanent parameter removal. These results explain the compatibility of pruning-based generalization improvements and the high generalization recently observed in overparameterized networks."}

The advantage of getting closer to the theoretical limit is quantifiable both by the generalization bound and by the network's simplicity. We argue that both the optimal architecture, number of layers and features/connections at each layer, are related to the bifurcation points of the information bottleneck tradeoff, namely, relevant compression of the input layer with respect to the output layer. The hierarchical representations at the layered network naturally correspond to the structural phase transitions along the information curve.

Yet, unlike traditional algorithms in this field, little is known about DNNs from the principles of numerical analysis, e.g., stability, accuracy, computational efficiency and sample complexity. In this paper we introduce a computational framework for examining DNNs in practice, and use it to study empirical performance with regard to these issues. We study performance of DNNs of different widths & depths on test functions in various dimensions, including smooth and piecewise smooth functions. We also compare DL against best-in-class methods for smooth function approx. based on compressed sensing (CS). Our main conclusion from these experiments is that there is a crucial gap between the approximation theory of DNNs and their practical performance, with trained DNNs performing relatively poorly on functions for which there are strong approximation results (e.g. smooth functions), yet performing well in comparison to best-in-class methods for other functions. To analyze this gap further, we provide some theoretical insights. We establish a practical existence theorem, asserting existence of a DNN architecture and training procedure that offers the same performance as CS. This establishes a key theoretical benchmark, showing the gap can be closed, albeit via a strategy guaranteed to perform as well as, but no better than, current best-in-class schemes.

When training a DNN model, the intermediate activation data must be saved in the memory during forward propagation and then restored for backward propagation. However, state-of-the-art accelerators such as GPUs are only equipped with very limited memory capacities due to hardware design constraints, which significantly limits the maximum batch size and hence performance speedup when training large-scale DNNs. In this paper, we propose a novel memory-driven high performance DNN training framework that leverages error-bounded lossy compression to significantly reduce the memory requirement for training in order to allow training larger networks. Different from the state-of-the-art solutions that adopt image-based lossy compressors such as JPEG to compress the activation data, our framework purposely designs error-bounded lossy compression with a strict error-controlling mechanism. Specifically, we provide theoretical analysis on the compression error propagation from the altered activation data to the gradients, and then empirically investigate the impact of altered gradients over the entire training process. Based on these analyses, we then propose an improved lossy compressor and an adaptive scheme to dynamically configure the lossy compression error-bound and adjust the training batch size to further utilize the saved memory space for additional speedup. We evaluate our design against state-of-the-art solutions with four popular DNNs and the ImageNet dataset.

The latter phase is believed to account for the good generalization performance exhibited by DNNs. Due to the challenging nature of estimating MI between high-dimensional random vectors, this hypothesis was only partially verified for NNs of tiny sizes or specific types, such as quantized NNs. In this paper, we introduce a framework for conducting IB analysis of general NNs. Our approach leverages the stochastic NN method proposed by Goldfeld et al.

The information bottleneck theory of deep learning proposes that neural networks achieve good generalization by compressing their representations to disregard information that is not relevant to the task. However, empirical evidence for this theory is conflicting, as compression was only observed when networks used saturating activation functions. In contrast, networks with non-saturating activation functions achieved comparable levels of task performance but did not show compression. In this paper we developed more robust mutual information estimation techniques, that adapt to hidden activity of neural networks and produce more sensitive measurements of activations from all functions, especially unbounded functions. Using these adaptive estimation techniques, we explored compression in networks with a range of different activation functions. With two improved methods of estimation, firstly, we show that saturation of the activation function is not required for compression, and the amount of compression varies between different activation functions. We also find that there is a large amount of variation in compression between different network initializations.

They typically use the pruning technique to reduce the size and complexity of the model, generating a lighter one with less resource consumption. Nonetheless, most existing pruning methods are proposed with the premise that the model after being pruned has a chance to be fine-tuned or even retrained based on the original training data. This may be unrealistic in practice, as the data controllers are often reluctant to provide their model consumers with the original data. In this work, we study the neural network pruning in the data-free context, aiming to yield lightweight models that are not only accurate in prediction but also robust against undesired inputs in open-world deployments. Considering the absence of the fine-tuning and retraining that can fix the mis-pruned units, we replace the traditional aggressive one-shot strategy with a conservative one that treats the pruning as a progressive process. We propose a pruning method based on stochastic optimization that uses robustness-related metrics to guide the pruning process.

Second, FastDeepIoT informs a compression algorithm how to minimize execution time on the profiled device without impacting accuracy. We evaluate FastDeepIoT using three different sensing-related tasks on two mobile devices: Nexus 5 and Galaxy Nexus. FastDeepIoT further reduces the neural network execution time by $48\\%$ to $78\\%$ and energy consumption by $37\\%$ to $69\\%$ compared with the state-of-the-art compression algorithms."}

One of the primary ML algorithms used in such systems is Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which demand high computational resources. This requirement has led to the use of ML accelerators like GPGPUs to meet design constraints. However, selecting the most suitable accelerator involves Design Space Exploration (DSE), a process that is usually time-consuming and requires significant manual effort. Our work presents approaches to expedite the DSE process by identifying the most appropriate GPGPU for CNN inferencing systems. We have developed a quick and precise technique for forecasting the power and performance of CNNs during inference, with a MAPE of 5.03% and 5.94%, respectively. Our approach empowers computer architects to estimate power and performance in the early stages of development, reducing the necessity for numerous prototypes.

However, much of this improvement is due to the growing use and availability of computational resources (e.g use of GPUs, more layers, more parameters, etc). Most state-of-the-art deep networks, despite performing well, over-parameterize approximate functions and take a significant amount of time to train. With increased focus on deploying deep neural networks on resource constrained devices like smart phones, there has been a push to evaluate why these models are so resource hungry and how they can be made more efficient. This work evaluates and compares three distinct methods for deep model compression and acceleration: weight pruning, low rank factorization, and knowledge distillation. Comparisons on VGG nets trained on CIFAR10 show that each of the models on their own are effective, but that the true power lies in combining them. We show that by combining pruning and knowledge distillation methods we can create a compressed network 85 times smaller than the original, all while retaining 96% of the original model's accuracy."}

The autonomous systems have special requirements of real-time, energy-efficient implementations of DNNs on a power-constrained system. Two research thrusts are dedicated to performance and energy efficiency enhancement of the inference phase of DNNs. The first one is model compression techniques while the second is efficient hardware implementation. Recent works on extremely-low-bit CNNs such as the binary neural network (BNN) and XNOR-Net replace the traditional floating-point operations with binary bit operations which significantly reduces the memory bandwidth and storage requirement. However, it suffers from non-negligible accuracy loss and underutilized digital signal processing (DSP) blocks of FPGAs. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes REQ-YOLO, a resource-aware, systematic weight quantization framework for object detection, considering both algorithm and hardware resource aspects in object detection. We adopt the block-circulant matrix method and propose a heterogeneous weight quantization using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), an effective optimization technique for general, non-convex optimization problems. To achieve real-time, highly-efficient implementations on FPGA, we present the detailed hardware implementation of block circulant matrices on CONV layers and develop an efficient processing element (PE) structure supporting the heterogeneous weight quantization, CONV dataflow and pipelining techniques, design optimization, and a template-based automatic synthesis framework to optimally exploit hardware resource. Experimental results show that our proposed REQ-YOLO framework can significantly compress the YOLO model while introducing very small accuracy degradation."}

Modeling resource utilization efficiently and accurately is challenging, especially for widely-used array-based inference accelerators such as Google TPU. In this work, we propose a novel hardware-aware NAS framework that does not only optimize for task accuracy and inference latency, but also for resource utilization. We also propose and validate a new computational model for resource utilization in inference accelerators.

Because the direct computation of the mutual information in continuous domains is intractable, our approach alternatively optimizes the student network by maximizing the variational lower bound of the mutual information. To achieve a tight lower bound, we introduce an energy-based model relying on a deep neural network to represent a flexible variational distribution that deals with high-dimensional images and consider spatial dependencies between pixels, effectively. Since the proposed method is a generic optimization algorithm, it can be conveniently incorporated into arbitrary generative adversarial networks and even dense prediction networks, e.g., image enhancement models. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves outstanding performance in model compression of generative adversarial networks consistently when combined with several existing models."}

They are increasingly being used on mobile devices, many times just by porting large models designed for server space, although several model compression techniques have been considered. One model compression technique intended to reduce computations is channel pruning. Mobile and embedded systems now have GPUs which are ideal for the parallel computations of neural networks and for their lower energy cost per operation. Specialized libraries perform these neural network computations through highly optimized routines. As we find in our experiments, these libraries are optimized for the most common network shapes, making uninstructed channel pruning inefficient. We evaluate higher level libraries, which analyze the input characteristics of a convolutional layer, based on which they produce optimized OpenCL (Arm Compute Library and TVM) and CUDA (cuDNN) code. However, in reality, these characteristics and subsequent choices intended for optimization can have the opposite effect. We show that a reduction in the number of convolutional channels, pruning 12% of the initial size, is in some cases detrimental to performance, leading to 2x slowdown. On the other hand, we also find examples where performance-aware pruning achieves the intended results, with performance speedups of 3x with cuDNN and above 10x with Arm Compute Library and TVM.

Efficient implementations of SNNs on modern digital hardware are also inspired by advances in machine learning and deep neural networks (DNNs). Two techniques widely employed in the efficient deployment of DNNs -- the quantization and pruning of parameters, can both compress the model size, reduce memory footprints, and facilitate low-latency execution. The interaction between quantization and pruning and how they might impact model performance on SNN accelerators is currently unknown. We study various combinations of pruning and quantization in isolation, cumulatively, and simultaneously (jointly) to a state-of-the-art SNN targeting gesture recognition for dynamic vision sensor cameras (DVS). We show that this state-of-the-art model is amenable to aggressive parameter quantization, not suffering from any loss in accuracy down to ternary weights. However, pruning only maintains iso-accuracy up to 80% sparsity, which results in 45% more energy than the best quantization on our architectural model.

To address this problem, we propose a global importance score SP-LAMP(Structured Pruning Layer-Adaptive Magnitude-based Pruning) by deriving a global importance score LAMP from unstructured pruning to structured pruning. In SP-LAMP, each layer includes a filter with an SP-LAMP score of 1, and the remaining filters are grouped. We utilize a group knapsack solver to maximize the SP-LAMP score under latency constraints. In addition, we improve the strategy of collect the latency to make it more accurate. In particular, for ResNet50/ResNet18 on ImageNet and CIFAR10, SP-LAMP is 1.28x/8.45x faster with +1.7%/-1.57% top-1 accuracy changed, respectively.

Thus, benchmarking AI hardware effectively becomes important and is of great help to select and optimize AI hardware. Unfortunately, there are few AI benchmarks available in both academia and industry. Examples are BenchNN[1], DeepBench[2], and Dawn Bench[3], which are usually a collection of typical real DNN applications. While these benchmarks provide performance comparison across different AI hardware, they suffer from a number of drawbacks. First, they cannot adapt to the emerging changes of DNN algorithms and are fixed once selected. Second, they contain tens to hundreds of applications and take very long time to finish running. Third, they are mainly selected from open sources, which are restricted by copyright and are not representable to proprietary applications. In this work, a synthetic benchmarks framework is firstly proposed to address the above drawbacks of AI benchmarks. Instead of pre-selecting a set of open-sourced benchmarks and running all of them, the synthetic approach generates only a one or few benchmarks that best represent a broad range of applications using profiled workload characteristics data of these applications. Thus, it can adapt to emerging changes of new DNN algorithms by re-profiling new applications and updating itself, greatly reduce benchmark count and running time, and strongly represent DNN applications of interests.

We review this evidence together with a detailed analysis of how the respective information quantities were estimated. Our survey suggests that compression visualized in information planes is not necessarily information-theoretic, but is rather often compatible with geometric compression of the latent representations. This insight gives the information plane a renewed justification. Aside from this, we shed light on the problem of estimating mutual information in deterministic neural networks and its consequences. Specifically, we argue that even in feed-forward neural networks the data processing inequality need not hold for estimates of mutual information.

We first describe our information-theoretic approach to deep learning. Then, we propose using the Information Bottleneck (IB) theory to explain deep learning systems. The novel paradigm for analyzing networks sheds light on their layered structure, generalization abilities, and learning dynamics. We later discuss one of the most challenging problems of applying the IB to deep neural networks - estimating mutual information. Recent theoretical developments, such as the neural tangent kernel (NTK) framework, are used to investigate generalization signals. In our study, we obtained tractable computations of many information-theoretic quantities and their bounds for infinite ensembles of infinitely wide neural networks. With these derivations, we can determine how compression, generalization, and sample size pertain to the network and how they are related. At the end, we present the dual Information Bottleneck (dualIB). This new information-theoretic framework resolves some of the IB's shortcomings by merely switching terms in the distortion function.

The theory aims to simplify and integrate concepts across artificial intelligence, mainstream computing and human perception and cognition, with information compression as a unifying theme. It is conceived as a brain-like system that receives 'New' information and stores some or all of it in compressed form as 'Old' information. It is realised in the form of a computer model -- a first version of the SP machine. The concept of \"multiple alignment\" is a powerful central idea. Using heuristic techniques, the system builds multiple alignments that are 'good' in terms of information compression. For each multiple alignment, probabilities may be calculated. These provide the basis for calculating the probabilities of inferences. The system learns new structures from partial matches between patterns. Using heuristic techniques, the system searches for sets of structures that are 'good' in terms of information compression. These are normally ones that people judge to be 'natural', in accordance with the 'DONSVIC' principle -- the discovery of natural structures via information compression. The SP theory may be applied in several areas including 'computing', aspects of mathematics and logic, representation of knowledge, natural language processing, pattern recognition, several kinds of reasoning, information storage and retrieval, planning and problem solving, information compression, neuroscience, and human perception and cognition. Examples include the parsing and production of language including discontinuous dependencies in syntax, pattern recognition at multiple levels of abstraction and its integration with part-whole relations, nonmonotonic reasoning and reasoning with default values, reasoning in Bayesian networks including 'explaining away', causal diagnosis, and the solving of a geometric analogy problem."}

To close the gap, in this work we'll take a first-principles approach, i.e. we'll directly impose the sparsity constraint on the loss function and leverage the framework of statistical dimension in convex geometry, thus enabling us to characterize the sharp phase transition point, which can be regarded as the fundamental limit of the pruning ratio. Through this limit, we're able to identify two key factors that determine the pruning ratio limit, namely, weight magnitude and network sharpness. Generally speaking, the flatter the loss landscape or the smaller the weight magnitude, the smaller pruning ratio. Moreover, we provide efficient countermeasures to address the challenges in the computation of the pruning limit, which mainly involves the accurate spectrum estimation of a large-scale and non-positive Hessian matrix. Moreover, through the lens of the pruning ratio threshold, we can also provide rigorous interpretations on several heuristics in existing pruning algorithms.
