In this article, we introduce CAR, a greedy structural compression scheme to obtain smaller and more interpretable CNNs, while achieving close to original accuracy. The compression is based on pruning filters with the least contribution to the classification accuracy. We demonstrate the interpretability of CAR-compressed CNNs by showing that our algorithm prunes filters with visually redundant functionalities such as color filters. These compressed networks are easier to interpret because they retain the filter diversity of uncompressed networks with order of magnitude less filters. Finally, a variant of CAR is introduced to quantify the importance of each image category to each CNN filter. Specifically, the most and the least important class labels are shown to be meaningful interpretations of each filter."}

If the target domain covers a smaller visual space than the source domain used for pre-training (e.g. ImageNet), the fine-tuned network is likely to be over-parameterized. However, applying network pruning as a post-processing step to reduce the memory requirements has drawbacks: fine-tuning and pruning are performed independently; pruning parameters are set once and cannot adapt over time; and the highly parameterized nature of state-of-the-art pruning methods make it prohibitive to manually search the pruning parameter space for deep networks, leading to coarse approximations. We propose a principled method for jointly fine-tuning and compressing a pre-trained convolutional network that overcomes these limitations. Experiments on two specialized image domains (remote sensing images and describable textures) demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach."}

We first statistically model the network pruning problem in a redundancy reduction perspective and find that pruning in the layer(s) with the most structural redundancy outperforms pruning the least important filters across all layers.

In fact, a fully-trained over-parameterized model will reduce the search space for the pruned structure. We empirically show that more diverse pruned structures can be directly pruned from randomly initialized weights, including potential models with better performance. Therefore, we propose a novel network pruning pipeline which allows pruning from scratch. In the experiments for compressing classification models on CIFAR10 and ImageNet datasets, our approach not only greatly reduces the pre-training burden of traditional pruning methods, but also achieves similar or even higher accuracy under the same computation budgets.

Recent works have identified, through an expensive sequence of training and pruning cycles, the existence of winning lottery tickets or sparse trainable subnetworks at initialization. This raises a foundational question: can we identify highly sparse trainable subnetworks at initialization, without ever training, or indeed without ever looking at the data? We provide an affirmative answer to this question through theory driven algorithm design. We first mathematically formulate and experimentally verify a conservation law that explains why existing gradient-based pruning algorithms at initialization suffer from layer-collapse, the premature pruning of an entire layer rendering a network untrainable. This theory also elucidates how layer-collapse can be entirely avoided, motivating a novel pruning algorithm Iterative Synaptic Flow Pruning (SynFlow). This algorithm can be interpreted as preserving the total flow of synaptic strengths through the network at initialization subject to a sparsity constraint. Notably, this algorithm makes no reference to the training data and consistently competes with or outperforms existing state-of-the-art pruning algorithms at initialization over a range of models (VGG and ResNet), datasets (CIFAR-10/100 and Tiny ImageNet), and sparsity constraints (up to 99.99 percent). Thus our data-agnostic pruning algorithm challenges the existing paradigm that, at initialization, data must be used to quantify which synapses are important."}

Unlike unstructured pruning, which only sets specific parameters to zero, structured pruning eliminates entire channels, thus yielding direct computational and storage benefits. However, the diverse patterns for coupling parameters, such as residual connections and group convolutions, the diverse deep learning frameworks, and the various time stages at which pruning can be performed make existing pruning methods less adaptable to different architectures, frameworks, and pruning criteria. To address this, we introduce Structurally Prune Anything (SPA), a versatile structured pruning framework that can prune neural networks with any architecture, from any framework, and at any stage of training. SPA leverages a standardized computational graph and ONNX representation to prune diverse neural network architectures without the need for manual intervention. SPA employs a group-level importance estimation method, which groups dependent computational operators, estimates their importance, and prunes unimportant coupled channels. This enables the transfer of various existing pruning criteria into a structured group style. As a result, SPA supports pruning at any time, either before training, after training with fine-tuning, or after training without fine-tuning. In the context of the latter, we introduce Optimal Brain SPA (OBSPA), an algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art pruning results needing neither fine-tuning nor calibration data. In extensive experiments, SPA shows competitive to state-of-the-art pruning performance across various architectures, from popular frameworks, at different pruning times."}

Most existing network pruning methods require laborious human efforts and prohibitive computation resources, especially when the constraints are changed. This practically limits the application of model compression when the model needs to be deployed on a wide range of devices. Besides, existing methods are still challenged by the missing theoretical guidance. In this paper we propose an information theory-inspired strategy for automatic model compression. The principle behind our method is the information bottleneck theory, i.e., the hidden representation should compress information with each other. We thus introduce the normalized Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (nHSIC) on network activations as a stable and generalized indicator of layer importance. When a certain resource constraint is given, we integrate the HSIC indicator with the constraint to transform the architecture search problem into a linear programming problem with quadratic constraints. Such a problem is easily solved by a convex optimization method with a few seconds. We also provide a rigorous proof to reveal that optimizing the normalized HSIC simultaneously minimizes the mutual information between different layers. Without any search process, our method achieves better compression tradeoffs comparing to the state-of-the-art compression algorithms. For instance, with ResNet-50, we achieve a 45.3%-FLOPs reduction, with a 75.75 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. Codes are avaliable at https://github.com/MAC-AutoML/ITPruner/tree/master."}

This motivation is particularly relevant given the perhaps surprising observation that a wide variety of pruning approaches increase test accuracy despite sometimes massive reductions in parameter counts. To better understand this phenomenon, we analyze the behavior of pruning over the course of training, finding that pruning's benefit to generalization increases with pruning's instability (defined as the drop in test accuracy immediately following pruning). We demonstrate that this \"generalization-stability tradeoff\" is present across a wide variety of pruning settings and propose a mechanism for its cause: pruning regularizes similarly to noise injection. Supporting this, we find less pruning stability leads to more model flatness and the benefits of pruning do not depend on permanent parameter removal. These results explain the compatibility of pruning-based generalization improvements and the high generalization recently observed in overparameterized networks."}

A long-standing hypothesis based on bias-variance trade-off attributes this generalization improvement to model size reduction. However, recent studies on over-parameterization characterize a new model size regime, in which larger models achieve better generalization. Pruning models in this over-parameterized regime leads to a contradiction -- while theory predicts that reducing model size harms generalization, pruning to a range of sparsities nonetheless improves it. Motivated by this contradiction, we re-examine pruning's effect on generalization empirically. We show that size reduction cannot fully account for the generalization-improving effect of standard pruning algorithms. Instead, we find that pruning leads to better training at specific sparsities, improving the training loss over the dense model. We find that pruning also leads to additional regularization at other sparsities, reducing the accuracy degradation due to noisy examples over the dense model. Pruning extends model training time and reduces model size. These two factors improve training and add regularization respectively. We empirically demonstrate that both factors are essential to fully explaining pruning's impact on generalization."}

Then we propose an ensemble pruning method including a centralized version and a distributed version, in which the latter is to speed up the former. At last, we extract a general distributed framework for ensemble pruning, which can be widely suitable for most of the existing ensemble pruning methods and achieve less time consuming without much accuracy degradation.

We instead propose a novel optimization-based structural pruning that learns the pruning masks in a probabilistic space directly by optimizing the loss of the pruned model. To preserve efficiency, our method eliminates the back-propagation through the LLM per se during optimization, requiring only the forward pass of the LLM. We achieve this by learning an underlying Bernoulli distribution to sample binary pruning masks, where we decouple the Bernoulli parameters from LLM loss, facilitating efficient optimization via policy gradient estimator without back-propagation. Thus, our method can 1) support global and heterogeneous pruning (i.e., automatically determine different redundancy for different layers), and 2) optionally initialize with a metric-based method (for our Bernoulli distributions).

The most prominent obstacle towards this goal lies in the structural coupling, which not only forces different layers to be pruned simultaneously, but also expects all removed parameters to be consistently unimportant, thereby avoiding structural issues and significant performance degradation after pruning. To address this problem, we propose a general and {fully automatic} method, \\emph{Dependency Graph} (DepGraph), to explicitly model the dependency between layers and comprehensively group coupled parameters for pruning.

They usually eliminate values near zero. While simple, it may not be the most appropriate method, as effective models may naturally have many small values associated with them. Removing near-zero values already embedded in model space may significantly reduce model accuracy. Another line of work has proposed to assign discrete prior over all possible sub-structures that still rely on human-crafted prior hypotheses. Worse still, existing methods use regularized point estimates, namely Hard Pruning, that can not provide error estimations and fail reliability justification for the pruned networks.

Specifically, DLLP remodels the vanilla networks as discrete priors for the latent pruned model and the other redundancy. More importantly, DLLP uses Stein Variational Inference to approach the latent prior and effectively bypasses calculating KL divergence with unknown distribution.

We functionally approximate the error of the pruned networks, showing it is predictable in terms of an invariant tying width, depth, and pruning level, such that networks of vastly different pruned densities are interchangeable. We demonstrate the accuracy of this approximation over orders of magnitude in depth, width, dataset size, and density. We show that the functional form holds (generalizes) for large scale data (e.g., ImageNet) and architectures (e.g., ResNets).

To keep up with this growth, we need very aggressive pruning techniques for efficient inference and deployment on edge devices. Existing pruning approaches are limited to channel pruning and struggle with aggressive parameter reductions. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-dimensional pruning framework that jointly optimizes pruning across channels, layers, and blocks while adhering to latency constraints. We develop a latency modeling technique that accurately captures model-wide latency variations during pruning, which is crucial for achieving an optimal latency-accuracy trade-offs at high pruning ratio. We reformulate pruning as a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP) to efficiently determine the optimal pruned structure with only a single pass. Our extensive results demonstrate substantial improvements over previous methods, particularly at large pruning ratios. In classification, our method significantly outperforms prior art HALP with a Top-1 accuracy of 70.0(v.s. 68.6) and an FPS of 5262 im/s(v.s. 4101 im/s). In 3D object detection, we establish a new state-of-the-art by pruning StreamPETR at a 45% pruning ratio, achieving higher FPS (37.3 vs. 31.7) and mAP (0.451 vs. 0.449) than the dense baseline."}

We conducted an extensive series of 485,838 experiments, applying a range of state-of-the-art pruning algorithms to a synthetic dataset we created, named the Cubist Spiral. Our findings reveal a significant gap in performance compared to ideal sparse networks, which we identified through a novel combinatorial search algorithm. We attribute this performance gap to current pruning algorithms' poor behaviour under overparameterization, their tendency to induce disconnected paths throughout the network, and their propensity to get stuck at suboptimal solutions, even when given the optimal width and initialization. This gap is concerning, given the simplicity of the network architectures and datasets used in our study. We hope that our research encourages further investigation into new pruning techniques that strive for true network sparsity."}

However, the deployment of such sizable models introduces challenges, particularly in increased latency and carbon emissions, which are antithetical to the ideals of Green AI. This paper introduces a novel multi-stage compression strategy for our proprietary LLM, AntGMM. Our methodology pivots on three main aspects: employing small training sample sizes, addressing multi-level redundancy through multi-stage pruning, and introducing an advanced distillation loss design. In our research, we constructed a dataset, the Multimodal Advertisement Audition Dataset (MAAD), from real-world scenarios within Alipay, and conducted experiments to validate the reliability of our proposed strategy. Furthermore, the effectiveness of our strategy is evident in its operational success in Alipay's real-world multimodal advertisement audition for three months from September 2023. Notably, our approach achieved a substantial reduction in latency, decreasing it from 700ms to 90ms, while maintaining online performance with only a slight performance decrease. Moreover, our compressed model is estimated to reduce electricity consumption by approximately 75 million kWh annually compared to the direct deployment of AntGMM, demonstrating our commitment to green AI initiatives.

Then, we identify layers that need to be preserved within each block based on their contribution. Finally, we reassemble the pruned blocks and fine-tune the compact model.

Prevailing pruning algorithms pre-define the width and depth of the pruned networks, and then transfer parameters from the unpruned network to pruned networks. To break the structure limitation of the pruned networks, we propose to apply neural architecture search to search directly for a network with flexible channel and layer sizes. The number of the channels/layers is learned by minimizing the loss of the pruned networks. The feature map of the pruned network is an aggregation of K feature map fragments (generated by K networks of different sizes), which are sampled based on the probability distribution.The loss can be back-propagated not only to the network weights, but also to the parameterized distribution to explicitly tune the size of the channels/layers. Specifically, we apply channel-wise interpolation to keep the feature map with different channel sizes aligned in the aggregation procedure. The maximum probability for the size in each distribution serves as the width and depth of the pruned network, whose parameters are learned by knowledge transfer, e.g., knowledge distillation, from the original networks. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness of our new perspective of network pruning compared to traditional network pruning algorithms. Various searching and knowledge transfer approaches are conducted to show the effectiveness of the two components. Code is at: https://github.com/D-X-Y/NAS-Projects."}

However, most existing methods of network pruning are empirical and heuristic, leaving it open whether good subnetworks provably exist, how to find them efficiently, and if network pruning can be provably better than direct training using gradient descent. We answer these problems positively by proposing a simple greedy selection approach for finding good subnetworks, which starts from an empty network and greedily adds important neurons from the large network. This differs from the existing methods based on backward elimination, which remove redundant neurons from the large network. Theoretically, applying the greedy selection strategy on sufficiently large {pre-trained} networks guarantees to find small subnetworks with lower loss than networks directly trained with gradient descent. Our results also apply to pruning randomly weighted networks. Practically, we improve prior arts of network pruning on learning compact neural architectures on ImageNet, including ResNet, MobilenetV2/V3, and ProxylessNet. Our theory and empirical results on MobileNet suggest that we should fine-tune the pruned subnetworks to leverage the information from the large model, instead of re-training from new random initialization as suggested in \\citet{liu2018rethinking}."}

Network pruning offers a solution to reduce model size and computational cost while maintaining performance. However, most current pruning methods focus primarily on improving sparsity by reducing the number of nonzero parameters, often neglecting other deployment costs such as inference time, which are closely related to the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs). In this paper, we propose FALCON, a novel combinatorial-optimization-based framework for network pruning that jointly takes into account model accuracy (fidelity), FLOPs, and sparsity constraints. A main building block of our approach is an integer linear program (ILP) that simultaneously handles FLOP and sparsity constraints. We present a novel algorithm to approximately solve the ILP. We propose a novel first-order method for our optimization framework which makes use of our ILP solver. Using problem structure (e.g., the low-rank structure of approx. Hessian), we can address instances with millions of parameters. Our experiments demonstrate that FALCON achieves superior accuracy compared to other pruning approaches within a fixed FLOP budget. For instance, for ResNet50 with 20% of the total FLOPs retained, our approach improves the accuracy by 48% relative to state-of-the-art. Furthermore, in gradual pruning settings with re-training between pruning steps, our framework outperforms existing pruning methods, emphasizing the significance of incorporating both FLOP and sparsity constraints for effective network pruning."}

To estimate the impact of removing a parameter, these methods use importance measures that were originally designed to prune trained models. Despite lacking justification for their use early-on in training, such measures result in surprisingly low accuracy loss. To better explain this behavior, we develop a general framework that uses gradient flow to unify state-of-the-art importance measures through the norm of model parameters. We use this framework to determine the relationship between pruning measures and evolution of model parameters, establishing several results related to pruning models early-on in training: (i) magnitude-based pruning removes parameters that contribute least to reduction in loss, resulting in models that converge faster than magnitude-agnostic methods; (ii) loss-preservation based pruning preserves first-order model evolution dynamics and is therefore appropriate for pruning minimally trained models; and (iii) gradient-norm based pruning affects second-order model evolution dynamics, such that increasing gradient norm via pruning can produce poorly performing models.

However, the size of AI models has been rapidly growing due to scaling laws and the success of foundational models, which poses an increasing challenge to leverage advanced models in practical applications. It is thus imperative to develop efficient models, especially for deploying AI solutions under resource-constrains or with time sensitivity. One potential solution is to perform model compression, a set of techniques that remove less important model components or reduce parameter precision, to reduce model computation demand. In this work, we demonstrate that model pruning, as a model compression technique, can effectively reduce inference cost for computational and digital pathology based analysis with a negligible loss of analysis performance. To this end, we develop a methodology for pruning the widely used U-Net-style architectures in biomedical imaging, with which we evaluate multiple pruning heuristics on nuclei instance segmentation and classification, and empirically demonstrate that pruning can compress models by at least 70% with a negligible drop in performance."}

It is applicable to any structured module, including a single attention head, an entire attention block, or a feed-forward subnetwork. Furthermore, we introduce spectral normalization to stabilize the distribution of the post-activation values of the Transformer layers, further improving the pruning effectiveness of the proposed methodology. We conduct experiments with BERT on 5 GLUE benchmark tasks to demonstrate that SNIP achieves effective pruning results while maintaining comparable performance.

However, the escalation in model size also engenders substantial deployment costs. While few efforts have explored model pruning techniques to reduce the size of LLMs, they mainly center on general or task-specific weights. This leads to suboptimal performance due to lacking specificity on the target domain or generality on different tasks when applied to domain-specific challenges. This work introduces an innovative unstructured dual-pruning methodology, D-Pruner, for domain-specific compression on LLM. It extracts a compressed, domain-specific, and task-agnostic LLM by identifying LLM weights that are pivotal for general capabilities, like linguistic capability and multi-task solving, and domain-specific knowledge. More specifically, we first assess general weight importance by quantifying the error incurred upon their removal with the help of an open-domain calibration dataset. Then, we utilize this general weight importance to refine the training loss, so that it preserves generality when fitting into a specific domain. Moreover, by efficiently approximating weight importance with the refined training loss on a domain-specific calibration dataset, we obtain a pruned model emphasizing generality and specificity. Our comprehensive experiments across various tasks in healthcare and legal domains show the effectiveness of D-Pruner in domain-specific compression.

Data pruning (DP), as an oft-stated approach to saving training burdens, filters out less influential samples to form a coreset for training. However, the increasing reliance on pretrained models for molecular tasks renders traditional in-domain DP methods incompatible. Therefore, we propose a Molecular data Pruning framework for enhanced Generalization (MolPeg), which focuses on the source-free data pruning scenario, where data pruning is applied with pretrained models. By maintaining two models with different updating paces during training, we introduce a novel scoring function to measure the informativeness of samples based on the loss discrepancy. As a plug-and-play framework, MolPeg realizes the perception of both source and target domain and consistently outperforms existing DP methods across four downstream tasks. Remarkably, it can surpass the performance obtained from full-dataset training, even when pruning up to 60-70% of the data on HIV and PCBA dataset. Our work suggests that the discovery of effective data-pruning metrics could provide a viable path to both enhanced efficiency and superior generalization in transfer learning."}

Alternatively, a recent approach shows that pruning can be done at initialization prior to training, based on a saliency criterion called connection sensitivity. However, it remains unclear exactly why pruning an untrained, randomly initialized neural network is effective. In this work, by noting connection sensitivity as a form of gradient, we formally characterize initialization conditions to ensure reliable connection sensitivity measurements, which in turn yields effective pruning results. Moreover, we analyze the signal propagation properties of the resulting pruned networks and introduce a simple, data-free method to improve their trainability. Our modifications to the existing pruning at initialization method lead to improved results on all tested network models for image classification tasks.

As illustrated by the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH), pruning also has the potential of improving their generalization ability. At the core of LTH, iterative magnitude pruning (IMP) is the predominant pruning method to successfully find 'winning tickets'. Yet, the computation cost of IMP grows prohibitively as the targeted pruning ratio increases. To reduce the computation overhead, various efficient 'one-shot' pruning methods have been developed, but these schemes are usually unable to find winning tickets as good as IMP. This raises the question of how to close the gap between pruning accuracy and pruning efficiency? To tackle it, we pursue the algorithmic advancement of model pruning. Specifically, we formulate the pruning problem from a fresh and novel viewpoint, bi-level optimization (BLO). We show that the BLO interpretation provides a technically-grounded optimization base for an efficient implementation of the pruning-retraining learning paradigm used in IMP. We also show that the proposed bi-level optimization-oriented pruning method (termed BiP) is a special class of BLO problems with a bi-linear problem structure. By leveraging such bi-linearity, we theoretically show that BiP can be solved as easily as first-order optimization, thus inheriting the computation efficiency. Through extensive experiments on both structured and unstructured pruning with 5 model architectures and 4 data sets, we demonstrate that BiP can find better winning tickets than IMP in most cases, and is computationally as efficient as the one-shot pruning schemes, demonstrating 2-7 times speedup over IMP for the same level of model accuracy and sparsity."}

However, since samples vary in difficulty, a dynamic model that adapts computation based on sample complexity offers a novel perspective for compression and scaling. Despite this potential, existing dynamic models are typically monolithic and model-specific, limiting their generalizability as broad compression and scaling methods. Additionally, most deployed DL systems are fixed, unable to adjust their scale once deployed and, therefore, cannot adapt to the varying real-time demands. This paper introduces DyCE, a dynamically configurable system that can adjust the performance-complexity trade-off of a DL model at runtime without requiring re-initialization or redeployment on inference hardware. DyCE achieves this by adding small exit networks to intermediate layers of the original model, allowing computation to terminate early if acceptable results are obtained. DyCE also decouples the design of an efficient dynamic model, facilitating easy adaptation to new base models and potential general use in compression and scaling. We also propose methods for generating optimized configurations and determining the types and positions of exit networks to achieve desired performance and complexity trade-offs. By enabling simple configuration switching, DyCE provides fine-grained performance tuning in real-time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DyCE through image classification tasks using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

This work investigates the important trade-off between uncertainty calibration, natural corruption robustness, and performance for current state-of-research post-hoc CNN pruning techniques in the context of image classification tasks. Our study reveals that post-hoc pruning substantially improves the model's uncertainty calibration, performance, and natural corruption robustness, sparking hope for safe and robust embedded CNNs.Furthermore, uncertainty calibration and natural corruption robustness are not mutually exclusive targets under pruning, as evidenced by the improved safety aspects obtained by post-hoc unstructured pruning with increasing compression."}

Specifically, PEEL first constructs a predefined backbone and then conducts resource reallocation on it to shift parameters from less informative layers to more important layers in one round, thus amplifying the positive effect of these informative layers. To demonstrate the effectiveness of PEEL , we perform extensive experiments on ImageNet with ResNet-18, ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3-small and EfficientNet-B0. Experimental results show that structures uncovered by PEEL exhibit competitive performance with state-of-the-art pruning algorithms under various pruning settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/cardwing/Codes-for-PEEL."}

However, in this study, we discovered that many layers of LLMs exhibit high similarity, and some layers play a negligible role in network functionality. Based on this observation, we define a metric called Block Influence (BI) to gauge the significance of each layer in LLMs. We then propose a straightforward pruning approach: layer removal, in which we directly delete the redundant layers in LLMs based on their BI scores. Experiments demonstrate that our method, which we call ShortGPT, significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in model pruning. Moreover, ShortGPT is orthogonal to quantization-like methods, enabling further reduction in parameters and computation. The ability to achieve better results through simple layer removal, as opposed to more complex pruning techniques, suggests a high degree of redundancy in the model architecture."}

However, current pruning algorithms still remain unsolved problems that how to assign layer-wise pruning ratios properly and discard the least important channels with a convincing criterion. In this paper, we present a novel channel pruning approach via information theory and interpretability of neural networks. Specifically, we regard information entropy as the expected amount of information for convolutional layers. In addition, if we suppose a matrix as a system of linear equations, a higher-rank matrix represents there exist more solutions to it, which indicates more uncertainty. From the point of view of information theory, the rank can also describe the amount of information. In a neural network, considering the rank and entropy as two information indicators of convolutional layers, we propose a fusion function to reach a compromise of them, where the fusion results are defined as ``information concentration''. When pre-defining layer-wise pruning ratios, we employ the information concentration as a reference instead of heuristic and engineering tuning to provide a more interpretable solution. Moreover, we leverage Shapley values, which are a potent tool in the interpretability of neural networks, to evaluate the channel contributions and discard the least important channels for model compression while maintaining its performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and promising performance of our method. For example, our method improves the accuracy by 0.21% when reducing 45.5% FLOPs and removing 40.3% parameters for ResNet-56 on CIFAR-10. Moreover, our method obtains loss in Top-1/Top-5 accuracies of 0.43%/0.11% by reducing 41.6% FLOPs and removing 35.0% parameters for ResNet-50 on ImageNet."}

To measure the actual performance of models, we develop a structured model pruning library for TensorFlow2 to modify models in place (instead of adding mask layers).

We propose Hardware-Aware Latency Pruning (HALP) that formulates structural pruning as a global resource allocation optimization problem, aiming at maximizing the accuracy while constraining latency under a predefined budget. For filter importance ranking, HALP leverages latency lookup table to track latency reduction potential and global saliency score to gauge accuracy drop. Both metrics can be evaluated very efficiently during pruning, allowing us to reformulate global structural pruning under a reward maximization problem given target constraint. This makes the problem solvable via our augmented knapsack solver, enabling HALP to surpass prior work in pruning efficacy and accuracy-efficiency trade-off. We examine HALP on both classification and detection tasks, over varying networks, on ImageNet and VOC datasets. In particular, for ResNet-50/-101 pruning on ImageNet, HALP improves network throughput by $1.60\\times$/$1.90\\times$ with $+0.3\\%$/$-0.2\\%$ top-1 accuracy changes, respectively. For SSD pruning on VOC, HALP improves throughput by $1.94\\times$ with only a $0.56$ mAP drop. HALP consistently outperforms prior art, sometimes by large margins."}

Structured weight pruning methods have been proposed to overcome the limitation of irregular network structure and demonstrated actual GPU acceleration. However, in prior work the pruning rate (degree of sparsity) and GPU acceleration are limited (to less than 50%) when accuracy needs to be maintained. In this work,we overcome these limitations by proposing a unified, systematic framework of structured weight pruning for DNNs. It is a framework that can be used to induce different types of structured sparsity, such as filter-wise, channel-wise, and shape-wise sparsity, as well non-structured sparsity. The proposed framework incorporates stochastic gradient descent with ADMM, and can be understood as a dynamic regularization method in which the regularization target is analytically updated in each iteration. Without loss of accuracy on the AlexNet model, we achieve 2.58X and 3.65X average measured speedup on two GPUs, clearly outperforming the prior work. The average speedups reach 3.15X and 8.52X when allowing a moderate ac-curacy loss of 2%. In this case the model compression for convolutional layers is 15.0X, corresponding to 11.93X measured CPU speedup.

However, current pruning algorithms either only focus on one pruning category, e.g., structured pruning and unstructured, or need extensive hyperparameter tuning in order to get reasonable accuracy performance. To address these challenges, we propose LEArnable Pruning (LEAP), an effective method to gradually prune the model based on thresholds learned by gradient descent. Different than previous learnable pruning methods, which utilize $L_0$ or $L_1$ penalty to indirectly affect the final pruning ratio, LEAP introduces a novel regularization function, that directly interacts with the preset target pruning ratio. Moreover, in order to reduce hyperparameter tuning, a novel adaptive regularization coefficient is deployed to control the regularization penalty adaptively. With the new regularization term and its associated adaptive regularization coefficient, LEAP is able to be applied for different pruning granularity, including unstructured pruning, structured pruning, and hybrid pruning, with minimal hyperparameter tuning. We apply LEAP for BERT models on QQP/MNLI/SQuAD for different pruning settings. Our result shows that for all datasets, pruning granularity, and pruning ratios, LEAP achieves on-par or better results as compared to previous heavily hand-tuned methods."}
{"id": "66", "arxiv": "2204.00408v3", "title": "Structured Pruning Learns Compact and Accurate Models", "abstract": "The growing size of neural language models has led to increased attention in model compression. The two predominant approaches are pruning, which gradually removes weights from a pre-trained model, and distillation, which trains a smaller compact model to match a larger one. Pruning methods can significantly reduce the model size but hardly achieve large speedups as distillation. However, distillation methods require large amounts of unlabeled data and are expensive to train. In this work, we propose a task-specific structured pruning method CoFi (Coarse- and Fine-grained Pruning), which delivers highly parallelizable subnetworks and matches the distillation methods in both accuracy and latency, without resorting to any unlabeled data. Our key insight is to jointly prune coarse-grained (e.g., layers) and fine-grained (e.g., heads and hidden units) modules, which controls the pruning decision of each parameter with masks of different granularity. We also devise a layerwise distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from unpruned to pruned models during optimization. Our experiments on GLUE and SQuAD datasets show that CoFi yields models with over 10x speedups with a small accuracy drop, showing its effectiveness and efficiency compared to previous pruning and distillation approaches."}

In this work, we theoretically prove that the sparsity of network weights is closely associated with model robustness.

Based on these findings, we propose a novel adversarial training method called inverse weights inheritance, which imposes sparse weights distribution on a large network by inheriting weights from a small network, thereby improving the robustness of the large network."}
{"id": "68", "arxiv": "2107.02306v2", "title": "Connectivity Matters: Neural Network Pruning Through the Lens of Effective Sparsity", "abstract": "Neural network pruning is a fruitful area of research with surging interest in high sparsity regimes. Benchmarking in this domain heavily relies on faithful representation of the sparsity of subnetworks, which has been traditionally computed as the fraction of removed connections (direct sparsity). This definition, however, fails to recognize unpruned parameters that detached from input or output layers of underlying subnetworks, potentially underestimating actual effective sparsity: the fraction of inactivated connections. While this effect might be negligible for moderately pruned networks (up to 10-100 compression rates), we find that it plays an increasing role for thinner subnetworks, greatly distorting comparison between different pruning algorithms. For example, we show that effective compression of a randomly pruned LeNet-300-100 can be orders of magnitude larger than its direct counterpart, while no discrepancy is ever observed when using SynFlow for pruning [Tanaka et al., 2020]. In this work, we adopt the lens of effective sparsity to reevaluate several recent pruning algorithms on common benchmark architectures (e.g., LeNet-300-100, VGG-19, ResNet-18) and discover that their absolute and relative performance changes dramatically in this new and more appropriate framework. To aim for effective, rather than direct, sparsity, we develop a low-cost extension to most pruning algorithms. Further, equipped with effective sparsity as a reference frame, we partially reconfirm that random pruning with appropriate sparsity allocation across layers performs as well or better than more sophisticated algorithms for pruning at initialization [Su et al., 2020]. In response to this observation, using a simple analogy of pressure distribution in coupled cylinders from physics, we design novel layerwise sparsity quotas that outperform all existing baselines in the context of random pruning."}

However, our work surprisingly discovers that network pruning sometimes even aggravates overfitting. We report an unexpected sparse double descent phenomenon that, as we increase model sparsity via network pruning, test performance first gets worse (due to overfitting), then gets better (due to relieved overfitting), and gets worse at last (due to forgetting useful information). While recent studies focused on the deep double descent with respect to model overparameterization, they failed to recognize that sparsity may also cause double descent. In this paper, we have three main contributions. First, we report the novel sparse double descent phenomenon through extensive experiments. Second, for this phenomenon, we propose a novel learning distance interpretation that the curve of $\\ell_{2}$ learning distance of sparse models (from initialized parameters to final parameters) may correlate with the sparse double descent curve well and reflect generalization better than minima flatness. Third, in the context of sparse double descent, a winning ticket in the lottery ticket hypothesis surprisingly may not always win."}

However, the role of data and its interplay with model-centric pruning has remained relatively unexplored.

Specifically, customized Visual Prompts are mounted to upgrade neural Network sparsification in our proposed VPNs framework. As a pioneering effort, this paper conducts systematic investigations about the impact of different visual prompts on model pruning and suggests an effective joint optimization approach. Extensive experiments with 3 network architectures and 8 datasets evidence the substantial performance improvements from VPNs over existing start-of-the-art pruning algorithms. Furthermore, we find that subnetworks discovered by VPNs from pre-trained models enjoy better transferability across diverse downstream scenarios.

Prior approaches such as magnitude pruning, SparseGPT, and Wanda, either concentrated solely on weights or integrated weights with activations for sparsity. However, they overlooked the informative gradients derived from pretrained LLMs. In this paper, we present a novel sparsity-centric pruning method for pretrained LLMs, termed Gradient-based Language Model Pruner (GBLM-Pruner). GBLM-Pruner leverages the first-order term of the Taylor expansion, operating in a training-free manner by harnessing properly normalized gradients from a few calibration samples to determine the pruning metric, and substantially outperforms competitive counterparts like SparseGPT and Wanda in multiple benchmarks. Intriguingly, by incorporating gradients, unstructured pruning with our method tends to reveal some structural patterns, which mirrors the geometric interdependence inherent in the LLMs' parameter structure. Additionally, GBLM-Pruner functions without any subsequent retraining or weight updates to maintain its simplicity as other counterparts. Extensive evaluations on LLaMA-1 and LLaMA-2 across various benchmarks show that GBLM-Pruner surpasses magnitude pruning, Wanda and SparseGPT by significant margins.

Direct application of Bayesian model reduction, however, gives rise to approximation errors. Therefore, a novel iterative pruning algorithm is presented to alleviate the problems arising with naive Bayesian model reduction, as supported experimentally on the publicly available UCI datasets for different inference algorithms. This novel parameter pruning scheme solves the shortcomings of current state-of-the-art pruning methods that are used by the signal processing community.

Thus, compressing a trained model without a significant loss in performance has become an increasingly important task. Tremendous advances has been made recently, where the main technical building blocks are parameter pruning, parameter sharing (quantization), and low-rank factorization. In this paper, we propose principled approaches to improve upon the common heuristics used in those building blocks, namely pruning and quantization. We first study the fundamental limit for model compression via the rate distortion theory. We bring the rate distortion function from data compression to model compression to quantify this fundamental limit. We prove a lower bound for the rate distortion function and prove its achievability for linear models. Although this achievable compression scheme is intractable in practice, this analysis motivates a novel model compression framework. This framework provides a new objective function in model compression, which can be applied together with other classes of model compressor such as pruning or quantization. Theoretically, we prove that the proposed scheme is optimal for compressing one-hidden-layer ReLU neural networks. Empirically, we show that the proposed scheme improves upon the baseline in the compression-accuracy tradeoff."}

Our study bridges this gap, seeking to understand the effect of adversarial inputs crafted for base models on their pruned versions. To examine this relationship, we have developed a comprehensive benchmark across diverse adversarial attacks and popular DNN models. We uniquely focus on models not previously exposed to adversarial training and apply pruning schemes optimized for accuracy and performance. Our findings reveal that while the benefits of pruning enhanced generalizability, compression, and faster inference times are preserved, adversarial robustness remains comparable to the base model. This suggests that model compression while offering its unique advantages, does not undermine adversarial robustness."}

However, deploying state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as VGG-16 and ResNets on resource-constrained edge devices is practically infeasible due to their large number of parameters and floating-point operations (FLOPs). Thus, the concept of network pruning as a type of model compression is gaining attention for accelerating CNNs on low-power devices. State-of-the-art pruning approaches, either structured or unstructured do not consider the different underlying nature of complexities being exhibited by convolutional layers and follow a training-pruning-retraining pipeline, which results in additional computational overhead. In this work, we propose a novel and computationally efficient pruning pipeline by exploiting the inherent layer-level complexities of CNNs. Unlike typical methods, our proposed complexity-driven algorithm selects a particular layer for filter-pruning based on its contribution to overall network complexity. We follow a procedure that directly trains the pruned model and avoids the computationally complex ranking and fine-tuning steps. Moreover, we define three modes of pruning, namely parameter-aware (PA), FLOPs-aware (FA), and memory-aware (MA), to introduce versatile compression of CNNs. Our results show the competitive performance of our approach in terms of accuracy and acceleration.

However, recent hybrid-/transformer-based approaches mainly focus on the benefits of transformers in capturing long-range dependency while ignoring the issues of their daunting computational complexity, high training costs, and redundant dependency. In this paper, we propose to employ adaptive pruning to transformers for medical image segmentation and propose a lightweight and effective hybrid network APFormer. To our best knowledge, this is the first work on transformer pruning for medical image analysis tasks. The key features of APFormer mainly are self-supervised self-attention (SSA) to improve the convergence of dependency establishment, Gaussian-prior relative position embedding (GRPE) to foster the learning of position information, and adaptive pruning to eliminate redundant computations and perception information. Specifically, SSA and GRPE consider the well-converged dependency distribution and the Gaussian heatmap distribution separately as the prior knowledge of self-attention and position embedding to ease the training of transformers and lay a solid foundation for the following pruning operation. Then, adaptive transformer pruning, both query-wise and dependency-wise, is performed by adjusting the gate control parameters for both complexity reduction and performance improvement. Extensive experiments on two widely-used datasets demonstrate the prominent segmentation performance of APFormer against the state-of-the-art methods with much fewer parameters and lower GFLOPs. More importantly, we prove, through ablation studies, that adaptive pruning can work as a plug-n-play module for performance improvement on other hybrid-/transformer-based methods.

A typical pruning algorithm is a three-stage pipeline, i.e., training (a large model), pruning and fine-tuning. During pruning, according to a certain criterion, redundant weights are pruned and important weights are kept to best preserve the accuracy. In this work, we make several surprising observations which contradict common beliefs. For all state-of-the-art structured pruning algorithms we examined, fine-tuning a pruned model only gives comparable or worse performance than training that model with randomly initialized weights. For pruning algorithms which assume a predefined target network architecture, one can get rid of the full pipeline and directly train the target network from scratch. Our observations are consistent for multiple network architectures, datasets, and tasks, which imply that: 1) training a large, over-parameterized model is often not necessary to obtain an efficient final model, 2) learned \"important\" weights of the large model are typically not useful for the small pruned model, 3) the pruned architecture itself, rather than a set of inherited \"important\" weights, is more crucial to the efficiency in the final model, which suggests that in some cases pruning can be useful as an architecture search paradigm. Our results suggest the need for more careful baseline evaluations in future research on structured pruning methods. We also compare with the \"Lottery Ticket Hypothesis\" (Frankle & Carbin 2019), and find that with optimal learning rate, the \"winning ticket\" initialization as used in Frankle & Carbin (2019) does not bring improvement over random initialization."}

However, progress on transfer learning mainly focuses on optimizing the weights of pre-trained models, which ignores the structure mismatch between the model and the target task. This paper aims to improve the transfer performance from another angle - in addition to tuning the weights, we tune the structure of pre-trained models, in order to better match the target task. To this end, we propose TransTailor, targeting at pruning the pre-trained model for improved transfer learning. Different from traditional pruning pipelines, we prune and fine-tune the pre-trained model according to the target-aware weight importance, generating an optimal sub-model tailored for a specific target task. In this way, we transfer a more suitable sub-structure that can be applied during fine-tuning to benefit the final performance. Extensive experiments on multiple pre-trained models and datasets demonstrate that TransTailor outperforms the traditional pruning methods and achieves competitive or even better performance than other state-of-the-art transfer learning methods while using a smaller model. Notably, on the Stanford Dogs dataset, TransTailor can achieve 2.7% accuracy improvement over other transfer methods with 20% fewer FLOPs."}

Many channel pruning works utilize structured sparsity regularization to zero out all the weights in some channels and automatically obtain structure-sparse network in training stage. However, these methods apply structured sparsity regularization on each layer separately where the correlations between consecutive layers are omitted. In this paper, we first combine one out-channel in current layer and the corresponding in-channel in next layer as a regularization group, namely out-in-channel. Our proposed Out-In-Channel Sparsity Regularization (OICSR) considers correlations between successive layers to further retain predictive power of the compact network. Training with OICSR thoroughly transfers discriminative features into a fraction of out-in-channels. Correspondingly, OICSR measures channel importance based on statistics computed from two consecutive layers, not individual layer. Finally, a global greedy pruning algorithm is designed to remove redundant out-in-channels in an iterative way. Our method is comprehensively evaluated with various CNN architectures including CifarNet, AlexNet, ResNet, DenseNet and PreActSeNet on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K datasets.

In most of the conducted research efforts, the sparsity is enforced for network pruning without any attention to the internal network characteristics such as unbalanced outputs of the neurons or more specifically the distribution of the weights and outputs of the neurons. That may cause severe accuracy drop due to uncontrolled sparsity. In this work, we propose an attention mechanism that simultaneously controls the sparsity intensity and supervised network pruning by keeping important information bottlenecks of the network to be active. On CIFAR-10, the proposed method outperforms the best baseline method by 6% and reduced the accuracy drop by 2.6x at the same level of sparsity."}

However, deploying LVLMs is often problematic due to their massive computational/energy costs and carbon consumption. Such issues make it infeasible to adopt conventional iterative global pruning, which is costly due to computing the Hessian matrix of the entire large model for sparsification. Alternatively, several studies have recently proposed layer-wise pruning approaches to avoid the expensive computation of global pruning and efficiently compress model weights according to their importance within a layer. However, they often suffer from suboptimal model compression due to their lack of a global perspective. To address this limitation in recent efficient pruning methods for large models, we propose Efficient Coarse-to-Fine LayerWise Pruning (ECoFLaP), a two-stage coarse-to-fine weight pruning approach for LVLMs. We first determine the sparsity ratios of different layers or blocks by leveraging the global importance score, which is efficiently computed based on the zeroth-order approximation of the global model gradients. Then, the model performs local layer-wise unstructured weight pruning based on globally-informed sparsity ratios. We validate our proposed method across various multimodal and unimodal models and datasets, demonstrating significant performance improvements over prevalent pruning techniques in the high-sparsity regime."}

We analyze the correlation for two layers from the different blocks which have a short-cut structure. It shows that, in one block, the deeper layer has many redundant filters which can be represented by filters in the former layer. So, it is necessary to take information from other layers into consideration in pruning. In this paper, a novel pruning method, named GraphPruning, is proposed. Any series of the network is viewed as a graph. To automatically aggregate neighboring features for each node, a graph aggregator based on graph convolution networks(GCN) is designed. In the training stage, a PruningNet that is given aggregated node features generates reasonable weights for any size of the sub-network. Subsequently, the best configuration of the Pruned Network is searched by reinforcement learning. Different from previous work, we take the node features from a well-trained graph aggregator instead of the hand-craft features, as the states in reinforcement learning.

However, the recent trend to design Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for achieving human-like cognitive abilities poses significant challenges towards the scalable design of neuromorphic systems (due to the increase in computation/storage demands). Network pruning [7] is a powerful technique to remove redundant connections for designing optimally connected (maximally sparse) DNNs. However, such pruning techniques induce irregular connections that are incoherent to the crossbar structure. Eventually they produce DNNs with highly inefficient hardware realizations (in terms of area and energy). In this work, we propose TraNNsformer - an integrated training framework that transforms DNNs to enable their efficient realization on MCA-based systems. TraNNsformer first prunes the connectivity matrix while forming clusters with the remaining connections. Subsequently, it retrains the network to fine tune the connections and reinforce the clusters. This is done iteratively to transform the original connectivity into an optimally pruned and maximally clustered mapping. Without accuracy loss, TraNNsformer reduces the area (energy) consumption by 28% - 55% (49% - 67%) with respect to the original network. Compared to network pruning, TraNNsformer achieves 28% - 49% (15% - 29%) area (energy) savings. Furthermore, TraNNsformer is a technology-aware framework that allows mapping a given DNN to any MCA size permissible by the memristive technology for reliable operations."}

In this specific data set, in the best circumstances, the volume of the network model is reduced by 49.7% compared with the original model, and the reasoning time is reduced by 52.5%.

However, previous methods seldom deal with complicated structures like residual connections, group/depth-wise convolution and feature pyramid network, where channels of multiple layers are coupled and need to be pruned simultaneously. In this paper, we present a general channel pruning approach that can be applied to various complicated structures. Particularly, we propose a layer grouping algorithm to find coupled channels automatically. Then we derive a unified metric based on Fisher information to evaluate the importance of a single channel and coupled channels. Moreover, we find that inference speedup on GPUs is more correlated with the reduction of memory rather than FLOPs, and thus we employ the memory reduction of each channel to normalize the importance. Our method can be used to prune any structures including those with coupled channels. We conduct extensive experiments on various backbones, including the classic ResNet and ResNeXt, mobile-friendly MobileNetV2, and the NAS-based RegNet, both on image classification and object detection which is under-explored. Experimental results validate that our method can effectively prune sophisticated networks, boosting inference speed without sacrificing accuracy."}

To solve these two problems, this study propose a gradient-matrix singularity analysis-based method to estimate the maximum network redundancy. Guided by that maximum rate, a novel and efficient hierarchical network pruning algorithm is developed to maximally condense the neuronal network structure without sacrificing network performance. Substantial experiments are performed to demonstrate the efficacy of the new method for pruning several advanced convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures.

To address these issues, we introduce the Decay Pruning Method (DPM), a novel smooth pruning approach with a self-rectifying mechanism. DPM consists of two key components: (i) Smooth Pruning: It converts conventional single-step pruning into multi-step smooth pruning, gradually reducing redundant structures to zero over N steps with ongoing optimization. (ii) Self-Rectifying: This procedure further enhances the aforementioned process by rectifying sub-optimal pruning based on gradient information. Our approach demonstrates strong generalizability and can be easily integrated with various existing pruning methods.

To this end, some recent works focus on sparsifying GNNs with the lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH) to reduce inference costs while maintaining performance levels. However, the LTH-based methods suffer from two major drawbacks: 1) they require exhaustive and iterative training of dense models, resulting in an extremely large training computation cost, and 2) they only trim graph structures and model parameters but ignore the node feature dimension, where significant redundancy exists. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a comprehensive graph gradual pruning framework termed CGP. This is achieved by designing a during-training graph pruning paradigm to dynamically prune GNNs within one training process. Unlike LTH-based methods, the proposed CGP approach requires no re-training, which significantly reduces the computation costs. Furthermore, we design a co-sparsifying strategy to comprehensively trim all three core elements of GNNs: graph structures, node features, and model parameters. Meanwhile, aiming at refining the pruning operation, we introduce a regrowth process into our CGP framework, in order to re-establish the pruned but important connections. The proposed CGP is evaluated by using a node classification task across 6 GNN architectures, including shallow models (GCN and GAT), shallow-but-deep-propagation models (SGC and APPNP), and deep models (GCNII and ResGCN), on a total of 14 real-world graph datasets, including large-scale graph datasets from the challenging Open Graph Benchmark.

To identify the optimal sequence for compressing neural networks, we propose the Order of Compression, a systematic and optimal sequence to apply multiple compression techniques in the most effective order. We start by building the foundations of the orders between any two compression approaches and then demonstrate inserting additional compression between any two compressions will not break the order of the two compression approaches. Based on the foundations, an optimal order is obtained with topological sorting. Validated on image-based regression and classification networks across different datasets, our proposed Order of Compression significantly reduces computational costs by up to 859 times on ResNet34, with negligible accuracy loss (-0.09% for CIFAR10) compared to the baseline model. We believe our simple yet effective exploration of the order of compression will shed light on the practice of model compression."}

Additionally, they require extensive compression time with large datasets to maintain performance in pruned models. To address these challenges, we propose VTrans, an iterative pruning framework guided by the Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) principle. Our method compresses all structural components, including embeddings, attention heads, and layers using VIB-trained masks. This approach retains only essential weights in each layer, ensuring compliance with specified model size or computational constraints. Notably, our method achieves upto 70% more compression than prior state-of-the-art approaches, both task-agnostic and task-specific. We further propose faster variants of our method: Fast-VTrans utilizing only 3% of the data and Faster-VTrans, a time efficient alternative that involves exclusive finetuning of VIB masks, accelerating compression by upto 25 times with minimal performance loss compared to previous methods. Extensive experiments on BERT, ROBERTa, and GPT-2 models substantiate the efficacy of our method. Moreover, our method demonstrates scalability in compressing large models such as LLaMA-2-7B, achieving superior performance compared to previous pruning methods.

We propose two operations: pruning and growing, that exploit the sparsity of PC structures. Specifically, the pruning operation removes unimportant sub-networks of the PC for model compression and comes with theoretical guarantees. The growing operation increases model capacity by increasing the size of the latent space. By alternatingly applying pruning and growing, we increase the capacity that is meaningfully used, allowing us to significantly scale up PC learning. Empirically, our learner achieves state-of-the-art likelihoods on MNIST-family image datasets and on Penn Tree Bank language data compared to other PC learners and less tractable deep generative models such as flow-based models and variational autoencoders (VAEs)."}

However, their security is threatened by backdoor attacks, which are achieved by adding artificial patterns to specific training data. Existing defense strategies primarily focus on using reverse engineering to reproduce the backdoor trigger generated by attackers and subsequently repair the DNN model by adding the trigger into inputs and fine-tuning the model with ground-truth labels. However, once the trigger generated by the attackers is complex and invisible, the defender cannot reproduce the trigger successfully then the DNN model will not be repaired, as the trigger is not effectively removed. In this work, we propose Adversarial Feature Map Pruning for Backdoor (FMP) to mitigate backdoor from the DNN. Unlike existing defense strategies, which focus on reproducing backdoor triggers, FMP attempts to prune backdoor feature maps, which are trained to extract backdoor information from inputs. After pruning these backdoor feature maps, FMP will fine-tune the model with a secure subset of training data. Our experiments demonstrate that, compared to existing defense strategies, FMP can effectively reduce the Attack Success Rate (ASR) even against the most complex and invisible attack triggers (e.g., FMP decreases the ASR to 2.86\\% in CIFAR10, which is 19.2\\% to 65.41\\% lower than baselines). Second, unlike conventional defense methods that tend to exhibit low robust accuracy (that is, the accuracy of the model on poisoned data), FMP achieves a higher RA, indicating its superiority in maintaining model performance while mitigating the effects of backdoor attacks (e.g., FMP obtains 87.40\\% RA in CIFAR10).

In this work, we propose neuron-to-neuron skip connections, which act as sparse weighted skip connections, to enhance the overall connectivity of pruned DNNs. Following a preliminary pruning step, N2NSkip connections are randomly added between individual neurons/channels of the pruned network, while maintaining the overall sparsity of the network.

Despite this reduction, the massive number of experts in MoEs still makes them expensive to serve. In this paper, we study how to address this, by pruning MoEs. Among pruning methodologies, unstructured pruning has been known to achieve the highest performance for a given pruning ratio, compared to structured pruning, since the latter imposes constraints on the sparsification structure. This is intuitive, as the solution space of unstructured pruning subsumes that of structured pruning. However, our counterintuitive finding reveals that expert pruning, a form of structured pruning, can actually precede unstructured pruning to outperform unstructured-only pruning. As existing expert pruning, requiring $O(\\frac{k^n}{\\sqrt{n}})$ forward passes for $n$ experts, cannot scale for recent MoEs, we propose a scalable alternative with $O(1)$ complexity, yet outperforming the more expensive methods. The key idea is leveraging a latent structure between experts, based on behavior similarity, such that the greedy decision of whether to prune closely captures the joint pruning effect. Ours is highly effective -- for Snowflake Arctic, a 480B-sized MoE with 128 experts, our method needs only one H100 and two hours to achieve nearly no loss in performance with 40% sparsity, even in generative tasks such as GSM8K, where state-of-the-art unstructured pruning fails to.
