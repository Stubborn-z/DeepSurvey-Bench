Numerous structured pruning methods are already developed that can readily achieve speedups in single-task models, but the pruning of multi-task networks has not yet been extensively studied. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of structured pruning on multi-task models. We use an existing single-task filter pruning criterion and also introduce an MTL-based filter pruning criterion for estimating the filter importance scores. We prune the model using an iterative pruning strategy with both pruning methods. We show that, with careful hyper-parameter tuning, architectures obtained from different pruning methods do not have significant differences in their performances across tasks when the number of parameters is similar. We also show that iterative structure pruning may not be the best way to achieve a well-performing pruned model because, at extreme pruning levels, there is a high drop in performance across all tasks. But when the same models are randomly initialized and re-trained, they show better results."}

A key feature of a good pruning algorithm is that it accurately quantifies the relative importance of the model weights. While model pruning has a rich history, we still don't have a full grasp of the pruning mechanics even for relatively simple problems involving linear models or shallow neural nets. In this work, we provide a principled exploration of pruning by building on a natural notion of importance. For linear models, we show that this notion of importance is captured by covariance scaling which connects to the well-known Hessian-based pruning. We then derive asymptotic formulas that allow us to precisely compare the performance of different pruning methods. For neural networks, we demonstrate that the importance can be at odds with larger magnitudes and proper initialization is critical for magnitude-based pruning. Specifically, we identify settings in which weights become more important despite becoming smaller, which in turn leads to a catastrophic failure of magnitude-based pruning. Our results also elucidate that implicit regularization in the form of Hessian structure has a catalytic role in identifying the important weights, which dictate the pruning performance."}

Conventional approaches follow a fixed paradigm which first trains a large and redundant network, and then determines which units (e.g., channels) are less important and thus can be removed. In this work, we find that pre-training an over-parameterized model is not necessary for obtaining the target pruned structure. In fact, a fully-trained over-parameterized model will reduce the search space for the pruned structure. We empirically show that more diverse pruned structures can be directly pruned from randomly initialized weights, including potential models with better performance. Therefore, we propose a novel network pruning pipeline which allows pruning from scratch. In the experiments for compressing classification models on CIFAR10 and ImageNet datasets, our approach not only greatly reduces the pre-training burden of traditional pruning methods, but also achieves similar or even higher accuracy under the same computation budgets.

A two objectives' problem that aims for the the weights and the best channels for each layer is first formulated. An alternative optimization approach is then proposed to derive the optimal channel numbers and weights simultaneously. In the process of pruning, we utilize a searchable hyperparameter, remaining ratio, to denote the number of channels in each convolution layer, and then a dynamic masking process is proposed to describe the corresponding channel evolution.

Since its growth in popularity in the recent years, pruning gave birth to countless papers and contributions, resulting first in critical inconsistencies in the way results are compared, and then to a collective effort to establish standardized benchmarks. However, said benchmarks are based on training practices that date from several years ago and do not align with current practices. In this work, we verify how results in the recent literature of pruning hold up against networks that underwent both state-of-the-art training methods and trivial model scaling.

Pruning methods can significantly reduce the model size but hardly achieve large speedups as distillation. However, distillation methods require large amounts of unlabeled data and are expensive to train. In this work, we propose a task-specific structured pruning method CoFi (Coarse- and Fine-grained Pruning), which delivers highly parallelizable subnetworks and matches the distillation methods in both accuracy and latency, without resorting to any unlabeled data. Our key insight is to jointly prune coarse-grained (e.g., layers) and fine-grained (e.g., heads and hidden units) modules, which controls the pruning decision of each parameter with masks of different granularity. We also devise a layerwise distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from unpruned to pruned models during optimization.

A long-standing hypothesis based on bias-variance trade-off attributes this generalization improvement to model size reduction. However, recent studies on over-parameterization characterize a new model size regime, in which larger models achieve better generalization. Pruning models in this over-parameterized regime leads to a contradiction -- while theory predicts that reducing model size harms generalization, pruning to a range of sparsities nonetheless improves it. Motivated by this contradiction, we re-examine pruning's effect on generalization empirically. We show that size reduction cannot fully account for the generalization-improving effect of standard pruning algorithms. Instead, we find that pruning leads to better training at specific sparsities, improving the training loss over the dense model. We find that pruning also leads to additional regularization at other sparsities, reducing the accuracy degradation due to noisy examples over the dense model. Pruning extends model training time and reduces model size. These two factors improve training and add regularization respectively. We empirically demonstrate that both factors are essential to fully explaining pruning's impact on generalization."}

A typical pruning algorithm is a three-stage pipeline, i.e., training (a large model), pruning and fine-tuning. During pruning, according to a certain criterion, redundant weights are pruned and important weights are kept to best preserve the accuracy. In this work, we make several surprising observations which contradict common beliefs. For all state-of-the-art structured pruning algorithms we examined, fine-tuning a pruned model only gives comparable or worse performance than training that model with randomly initialized weights. For pruning algorithms which assume a predefined target network architecture, one can get rid of the full pipeline and directly train the target network from scratch. Our observations are consistent for multiple network architectures, datasets, and tasks, which imply that: 1) training a large, over-parameterized model is often not necessary to obtain an efficient final model, 2) learned \"important\" weights of the large model are typically not useful for the small pruned model, 3) the pruned architecture itself, rather than a set of inherited \"important\" weights, is more crucial to the efficiency in the final model, which suggests that in some cases pruning can be useful as an architecture search paradigm. Our results suggest the need for more careful baseline evaluations in future research on structured pruning methods. We also compare with the \"Lottery Ticket Hypothesis\" (Frankle & Carbin 2019), and find that with optimal learning rate, the \"winning ticket\" initialization as used in Frankle & Carbin (2019) does not bring improvement over random initialization."}

To address these challenges, we propose LEArnable Pruning (LEAP), an effective method to gradually prune the model based on thresholds learned by gradient descent. Different than previous learnable pruning methods, which utilize $L_0$ or $L_1$ penalty to indirectly affect the final pruning ratio, LEAP introduces a novel regularization function, that directly interacts with the preset target pruning ratio. Moreover, in order to reduce hyperparameter tuning, a novel adaptive regularization coefficient is deployed to control the regularization penalty adaptively. With the new regularization term and its associated adaptive regularization coefficient, LEAP is able to be applied for different pruning granularity, including unstructured pruning, structured pruning, and hybrid pruning, with minimal hyperparameter tuning. We apply LEAP for BERT models on QQP/MNLI/SQuAD for different pruning settings.

To address these challenges, we propose FedTiny, a distributed pruning framework for federated learning that generates specialized tiny models for memory- and computing-constrained devices. We introduce two key modules in FedTiny to adaptively search coarse- and finer-pruned specialized models to fit deployment scenarios with sparse and cheap local computation. First, an adaptive batch normalization selection module is designed to mitigate biases in pruning caused by the heterogeneity of local data. Second, a lightweight progressive pruning module aims to finer prune the models under strict memory and computational budgets, allowing the pruning policy for each layer to be gradually determined rather than evaluating the overall model structure. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FedTiny, which outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly when compressing deep models to extremely sparse tiny models.

Specifically, the workload imbalance happens when a different number of non-zero weights are assigned to hardware units running in parallel. This results in low hardware utilization and thus imposes longer latency and higher energy costs. In preliminary experiments, we show that sparse SNNs (~98% weight sparsity) can suffer as low as ~59% utilization. To alleviate the workload imbalance problem, we propose u-Ticket, where we monitor and adjust the weight connections of the SNN during Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) based pruning, thus guaranteeing the final ticket gets optimal utilization when deployed onto the hardware.

Numerous pruning methods have been proposed since, each claiming to be better than prior art, however, at the cost of increasingly complex pruning methodologies. These methodologies include utilizing importance scores, getting feedback through back-propagation or having heuristics-based pruning rules amongst others. In this work, we question whether this pattern of introducing complexity is really necessary to achieve better pruning results. We benchmark these SOTA techniques against a simple pruning baseline, namely, Global Magnitude Pruning (Global MP), that ranks weights in order of their magnitudes and prunes the smallest ones. Surprisingly, we find that vanilla Global MP performs very well against the SOTA techniques. When considering sparsity-accuracy trade-off, Global MP performs better than all SOTA techniques at all sparsity ratios. When considering FLOPs-accuracy trade-off, some SOTA techniques outperform Global MP at lower sparsity ratios, however, Global MP starts performing well at high sparsity ratios and performs very well at extremely high sparsity ratios. Moreover, we find that a common issue that many pruning algorithms run into at high sparsity rates, namely, layer-collapse, can be easily fixed in Global MP. We explore why layer collapse occurs in networks and how it can be mitigated in Global MP by utilizing a technique called Minimum Threshold.

Most existing works introduce too many additional learnable parameters to assign different pruning rates across different layers in CNN or cannot control the compression rate explicitly. Since too narrow network blocks information flow for training, automatic pruning rate setting cannot explore a high pruning rate for a specific layer. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework named Layer Adaptive Progressive Pruning (LAPP), which gradually compresses the network during initial training of a few epochs from scratch. In particular, LAPP designs an effective and efficient pruning strategy that introduces a learnable threshold for each layer and FLOPs constraints for network. Guided by both task loss and FLOPs constraints, the learnable thresholds are dynamically and gradually updated to accommodate changes of importance scores during training. Therefore the pruning strategy can gradually prune the network and automatically determine the appropriate pruning rates for each layer. What's more, in order to maintain the expressive power of the pruned layer, before training starts, we introduce an additional lightweight bypass for each convolutional layer to be pruned, which only adds relatively few additional burdens. Our method demonstrates superior performance gains over previous compression methods on various datasets and backbone architectures.

Besides, these methods are designed for pruning a specific structure, such as filter or block structures without jointly pruning heterogeneous structures. In this paper, we propose an effective structured pruning approach that jointly prunes filters as well as other structures in an end-to-end manner. To accomplish this, we first introduce a soft mask to scale the output of these structures by defining a new objective function with sparsity regularization to align the output of baseline and network with this mask. We then effectively solve the optimization problem by generative adversarial learning (GAL), which learns a sparse soft mask in a label-free and an end-to-end manner. By forcing more scaling factors in the soft mask to zero, the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA) can be leveraged to fast and reliably remove the corresponding structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GAL on different datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet ILSVRC 2012.

Such achievements are possible since pruning reduces network capacity and provides regularization, which have been proven effective tools against adversarial images. In contrast to promising defense mechanisms that require training with adversarial images and careful regularization, we show that pruning obtains competitive results considering only natural images (e.g., the standard and low-cost training).

Prior work on the subject has developed largely along two orthogonal directions: (1) differentiable pruning for efficiently and accurately scoring the importance of parameters, and (2) combinatorial optimization for efficiently searching over the space of sparse models. We unite the two approaches, both theoretically and empirically, to produce a coherent framework for structured neural network pruning in which differentiable pruning guides combinatorial optimization algorithms to select the most important sparse set of parameters. Theoretically, we show how many existing differentiable pruning techniques can be understood as nonconvex regularization for group sparse optimization, and prove that for a wide class of nonconvex regularizers, the global optimum is unique, group-sparse, and provably yields an approximate solution to a sparse convex optimization problem. The resulting algorithm that we propose, SequentialAttention++, advances the state of the art in large-scale neural network block-wise pruning tasks on the ImageNet and Criteo datasets."}

The proposed approach makes a joint consideration of batch normalization (BN) and rectified linear unit (ReLU) for channel pruning; it estimates how likely the two successive operations deactivate each feature map and prunes the channels with high probabilities. To this end, we learn differentiable masks for individual channels and make soft decisions throughout the optimization procedure, which facilitates to explore larger search space and train more stable networks. The proposed framework enables us to identify compressed models via a joint learning of model parameters and channel pruning without an extra procedure of fine-tuning. We perform extensive experiments and achieve outstanding performance in terms of the accuracy of output networks given the same amount of resources when compared with the state-of-the-art methods."}

However, current methods are insufficient to enable this optimization and lead to a large degradation in model performance. In this paper, we identify a fundamental limitation in the formulation of current methods, namely that their saliency criteria look at a single step at the start of training without taking into account the trainability of the network. While pruning iteratively and gradually has been shown to improve pruning performance, explicit consideration of the training stage that will immediately follow pruning has so far been absent from the computation of the saliency criterion. To overcome the short-sightedness of existing methods, we propose Prospect Pruning (ProsPr), which uses meta-gradients through the first few steps of optimization to determine which weights to prune. ProsPr combines an estimate of the higher-order effects of pruning on the loss and the optimization trajectory to identify the trainable sub-network. Our method achieves state-of-the-art pruning performance on a variety of vision classification tasks, with less data and in a single shot compared to existing pruning-at-initialization methods."}

The discrete nature of the selection problem, however, makes this optimization difficult. To tackle this problem we introduce a novel concept of a trainable gate function. The trainable gate function, which confers a differentiable property to discretevalued variables, allows us to directly optimize loss functions that include non-differentiable discrete values such as 0-1 selection. The proposed trainable gate can be applied to pruning. Pruning can be carried out simply by appending the proposed trainable gate functions to each intermediate output tensor followed by fine-tuning the overall model, using any gradient-based training methods. So the proposed method can jointly optimize the selection of the pruned channels while fine-tuning the weights of the pruned model at the same time. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method efficiently optimizes arbitrary neural networks in various tasks such as image classification, style transfer, optical flow estimation, and neural machine translation."}

Despite these advantages, deploying large-scale SNNs on edge hardware is challenging due to limited resource availability. Network pruning offers a viable approach to compress the network scale and reduce hardware resource requirements for model deployment. However, existing SNN pruning methods cause high pruning costs and performance loss because they lack efficiency in processing the sparse spike representation of SNNs. In this paper, inspired by the critical brain hypothesis in neuroscience and the high biological plausibility of SNNs, we explore and leverage criticality to facilitate efficient pruning in deep SNNs. We firstly explain criticality in SNNs from the perspective of maximizing feature information entropy. Second, We propose a low-cost metric for assess neuron criticality in feature transmission and design a pruning-regeneration method that incorporates this criticality into the pruning process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves higher performance than the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) method with up to 95.26\\% reduction of pruning cost. The criticality-based regeneration process efficiently selects potential structures and facilitates consistent feature representation."}

Unfortunately, special hardware requirements and limited study on its effectiveness on already compact models prevent its wider adoption. Depth pruning is a form of pruning that requires no specialized hardware but suffers from a large accuracy falloff. To improve this, we propose a modification that utilizes a highly efficient auxiliary network as an effective interpreter of intermediate feature maps. Our results show a parameter reduction of 93% on the MLPerfTiny Visual Wakewords (VWW) task and 28% on the Keyword Spotting (KWS) task with accuracy cost of 0.65% and 1.06% respectively. When evaluated on a Cortex-M0 microcontroller, our proposed method reduces the VWW model size by 4.7x and latency by 1.6x while counter intuitively gaining 1% accuracy.

However, a slow retraining or fine-tuning procedure is often required to recover the accuracy loss caused by pruning. Recently, a new research direction on weight pruning, pruning-at-initialization (PAI), is proposed to directly prune CNNs before training so that fine-tuning or retraining can be avoided. While PAI has shown promising results in reducing the model size, existing approaches rely on fine-grained weight pruning which requires unstructured sparse matrix computation, making it difficult to achieve real speedup in practice unless the sparsity is very high. This work is the first to show that fine-grained weight pruning is in fact not necessary for PAI. Instead, the layerwise compression ratio is the main critical factor to determine the accuracy of a CNN model pruned at initialization. Based on this key observation, we propose PreCropping, a structured hardware-efficient model compression scheme. PreCropping directly compresses the model at the channel level following the layerwise compression ratio. Compared to weight pruning, the proposed scheme is regular and dense in both storage and computation without sacrificing accuracy. In addition, since PreCropping compresses CNNs at initialization, the computational and memory costs of CNNs are reduced for both training and inference on commodity hardware. We empirically demonstrate our approaches on several modern CNN architectures, including ResNet, ShuffleNet, and MobileNet for both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet."}

The increasing size of CNN models, however, prevents them from being widely deployed to devices with limited computational resources, e.g., mobile/embedded devices. The emerging topic of model pruning strives to address this problem by removing less important neurons and fine-tuning the pruned networks to minimize the accuracy loss. Nevertheless, existing automated pruning solutions often rely on a numerical threshold of the pruning criteria, lacking the flexibility to optimally balance the trade-off between model size and accuracy. Moreover, the complicated interplay between the stages of neuron pruning and model fine-tuning makes this process opaque, and therefore becomes difficult to optimize. In this paper, we address these challenges through a visual analytics approach, named CNNPruner. It considers the importance of convolutional filters through both instability and sensitivity, and allows users to interactively create pruning plans according to a desired goal on model size or accuracy. Also, CNNPruner integrates state-of-the-art filter visualization techniques to help users understand the roles that different filters played and refine their pruning plans. Through comprehensive case studies on CNNs with real-world sizes, we validate the effectiveness of CNNPruner."}

Pruning involves removing unimportant weights and connections from the model, resulting in a smaller and more efficient model. Pruning can be done during training or after the model has been trained. Another approach is to optimize the deep learning models specifically for the Raspberry Pi architecture. This can include optimizing the model's architecture and parameters to take advantage of the Raspberry Pi's hardware capabilities, such as its CPU and GPU. Additionally, the model can be optimized for energy efficiency by minimizing the amount of computation required. Pruning and optimizing deep learning models for the Raspberry Pi can help overcome the computational and energy constraints of low-power devices, making it possible to run deep learning models on a wider range of devices.

Pruning can reduce the parameter-counts of many state-of-the-art neural networks by an order of magnitude without compromising accuracy, meaning these networks contain a vast amount of unnecessary structure. In this paper, we study the relationship between pruning and interpretability. Namely, we consider the effect of removing unnecessary structure on the number of hidden units that learn disentangled representations of human-recognizable concepts as identified by network dissection. We aim to evaluate how the interpretability of pruned neural networks changes as they are compressed. We find that pruning has no detrimental effect on this measure of interpretability until so few parameters remain that accuracy beings to drop.

The Internet of Things (IoT) promises to inject machine learning into many of these every-day objects via tiny, cheap MCUs. However, these resource-impoverished hardware platforms severely limit the complexity of machine learning models that can be deployed. For example, although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieve state-of-the-art results on many visual recognition tasks, CNN inference on MCUs is challenging due to severe finite memory limitations. To circumvent the memory challenge associated with CNNs, various alternatives have been proposed that do fit within the memory budget of an MCU, albeit at the cost of prediction accuracy. This paper challenges the idea that CNNs are not suitable for deployment on MCUs. We demonstrate that it is possible to automatically design CNNs which generalize well, while also being small enough to fit onto memory-limited MCUs. Our Sparse Architecture Search method combines neural architecture search with pruning in a single, unified approach, which learns superior models on four popular IoT datasets.

They are increasingly being used on mobile devices, many times just by porting large models designed for server space, although several model compression techniques have been considered. One model compression technique intended to reduce computations is channel pruning. Mobile and embedded systems now have GPUs which are ideal for the parallel computations of neural networks and for their lower energy cost per operation. Specialized libraries perform these neural network computations through highly optimized routines. As we find in our experiments, these libraries are optimized for the most common network shapes, making uninstructed channel pruning inefficient. We evaluate higher level libraries, which analyze the input characteristics of a convolutional layer, based on which they produce optimized OpenCL (Arm Compute Library and TVM) and CUDA (cuDNN) code. However, in reality, these characteristics and subsequent choices intended for optimization can have the opposite effect. We show that a reduction in the number of convolutional channels, pruning 12% of the initial size, is in some cases detrimental to performance, leading to 2x slowdown. On the other hand, we also find examples where performance-aware pruning achieves the intended results, with performance speedups of 3x with cuDNN and above 10x with Arm Compute Library and TVM.

Pruning is one solution that significantly reduces the space and time complexities of DNNs. Traditional pruning methods that are applied post-training focus on streamlining inference, but there are recent efforts to leverage sparsity early on by pruning before training. Pruning methods, such as iterative magnitude-based pruning (IMP) achieve up to a 90% parameter reduction while retaining accuracy comparable to the original model. However, this leads to impractical runtime as it relies on multiple train-prune-reset cycles to identify and eliminate redundant parameters. In contrast, training agnostic early pruning methods, such as SNIP and SynFlow offer fast pruning but fall short of the accuracy achieved by IMP at high sparsities. To bridge this gap, we present Dual Gradient-Based Rapid Iterative Pruning (DRIVE), which leverages dense training for initial epochs to counteract the randomness inherent at the initialization. Subsequently, it employs a unique dual gradient-based metric for parameter ranking. It has been experimentally demonstrated for VGG and ResNet architectures on CIFAR-10/100 and Tiny ImageNet, and ResNet on ImageNet that DRIVE consistently has superior performance over other training-agnostic early pruning methods in accuracy.

Width wise pruning (filter pruning) is commonly performed via learnable gates or switches and sparsity regularizers whereas pruning of layers has so far been performed arbitrarily by manually designing a smaller network usually referred to as a student network. We propose a comprehensive pruning strategy that can perform both width-wise as well as depth-wise pruning. This is achieved by introducing gates at different granularities (neuron, filter, layer, block) which are then controlled via an objective function that simultaneously performs pruning at different granularity during each forward pass.

Existing methods commonly set sparsity-inducing penalty terms to suppress the importance of dropped weights, which is regarded as the suppressed sparsification paradigm. However, this paradigm inactivates the dropped parts of networks causing capacity damage before pruning, thereby leading to performance degradation. To alleviate this issue, we first study and reveal the relative sparsity effect in emerging stimulative training and then propose a structured pruning framework, named STP, based on an enhanced sparsification paradigm which maintains the magnitude of dropped weights and enhances the expressivity of kept weights by self-distillation. Besides, to find an optimal architecture for the pruned network, we propose a multi-dimension architecture space and a knowledge distillation-guided exploration strategy. To reduce the huge capacity gap of distillation, we propose a subnet mutating expansion technique. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks indicate the effectiveness of STP. Specifically, without fine-tuning, our method consistently achieves superior performance at different budgets, especially under extremely aggressive pruning scenarios, e.g., remaining 95.11% Top-1 accuracy (72.43% in 76.15%) while reducing 85% FLOPs for ResNet-50 on ImageNet.

In this paper, we present a simple yet effective method, termed Optimal Thresholding (OT), to prune channels with layer dependent thresholds that optimally separate important from negligible channels. By using OT, most negligible or unimportant channels are pruned to achieve high sparsity while minimizing performance degradation.

Prior art in filter pruning requires users to specify a target model complexity (e.g., model size or FLOP count) for the resulting architecture. However, determining a target model complexity can be difficult for optimizing various embodied AI applications such as autonomous robots, drones, and user-facing applications. First, both the accuracy and the speed of ConvNets can affect the performance of the application. Second, the performance of the application can be hard to assess without evaluating ConvNets during inference. As a consequence, finding a sweet-spot between the accuracy and speed via filter pruning, which needs to be done in a trial-and-error fashion, can be time-consuming. This work takes a first step toward making this process more efficient by altering the goal of model compression to producing a set of ConvNets with various accuracy and latency trade-offs instead of producing one ConvNet targeting some pre-defined latency constraint.

Nonetheless, AdvProp suffers from the extremely slow training speed, mainly because: a) extra forward and backward passes are required for generating adversarial examples; b) both original samples and their adversarial counterparts are used for training (i.e., 2$\\times$ data). In this paper, we introduce Fast AdvProp, which aggressively revamps AdvProp's costly training components, rendering the method nearly as cheap as the vanilla training. Specifically, our modifications in Fast AdvProp are guided by the hypothesis that disentangled learning with adversarial examples is the key for performance improvements, while other training recipes (e.g., paired clean and adversarial training samples, multi-step adversarial attackers) could be largely simplified. Our empirical results show that, compared to the vanilla training baseline, Fast AdvProp is able to further model performance on a spectrum of visual benchmarks, without incurring extra training cost. Additionally, our ablations find Fast AdvProp scales better if larger models are used, is compatible with existing data augmentation methods (i.e., Mixup and CutMix), and can be easily adapted to other recognition tasks like object detection.

While filter and channel pruning are preferable to other structure pruning methods in terms of realistic acceleration and hardware compatibility, pruning methods with a finer granularity, such as intra-channel pruning, are expected to be capable of yielding more compact and computationally efficient networks. Typical intra-channel pruning methods utilize a static and hand-crafted pruning granularity due to a large search space, which leaves room for improvement in their pruning performance. In this work, we introduce a novel structure pruning method, termed as dynamic structure pruning, to identify optimal pruning granularities for intra-channel pruning. In contrast to existing intra-channel pruning methods, the proposed method automatically optimizes dynamic pruning granularities in each layer while training deep neural networks. To achieve this, we propose a differentiable group learning method designed to efficiently learn a pruning granularity based on gradient-based learning of filter groups. The experimental results show that dynamic structure pruning achieves state-of-the-art pruning performance and better realistic acceleration on a GPU compared with channel pruning. In particular, it reduces the FLOPs of ResNet50 by 71.85% without accuracy degradation on the ImageNet dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/irishev/DSP."}

Most of existing pruning methods mainly focus on classification. Few of them conduct systematic research on object detection. However, object detection is different from classification, which requires not only semantic information but also localization information. In this paper, based on discrimination-aware channel pruning (DCP) which is state-of-the-art pruning method for classification, we propose a localization-aware auxiliary network to find out the channels with key information for classification and regression so that we can conduct channel pruning directly for object detection, which saves lots of time and computing resources. In order to capture the localization information, we first design the auxiliary network with a contextual ROIAlign layer which can obtain precise localization information of the default boxes by pixel alignment and enlarges the receptive fields of the default boxes when pruning shallow layers. Then, we construct a loss function for object detection task which tends to keep the channels that contain the key information for classification and regression. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. On MS COCO, we prune 70\\% parameters of the SSD based on ResNet-50 with modest accuracy drop, which outperforms the-state-of-art method."}

A more reasonable approach is to find a sparse minimizer along the flat minimum valley found by optimizers, i.e. stochastic gradient descent, which keeps the training loss constant. To achieve this goal, we propose the structured directional pruning based on orthogonal projecting the perturbations onto the flat minimum valley. We also propose a fast solver sDprun and further prove that it achieves directional pruning asymptotically after sufficient training. Experiments using VGG-Net and ResNet on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets show that our method obtains the state-of-the-art pruned accuracy (i.e. 93.97% on VGG16, CIFAR-10 task) without retraining.

Unlike unstructured pruning, which only sets specific parameters to zero, structured pruning eliminates entire channels, thus yielding direct computational and storage benefits. However, the diverse patterns for coupling parameters, such as residual connections and group convolutions, the diverse deep learning frameworks, and the various time stages at which pruning can be performed make existing pruning methods less adaptable to different architectures, frameworks, and pruning criteria. To address this, we introduce Structurally Prune Anything (SPA), a versatile structured pruning framework that can prune neural networks with any architecture, from any framework, and at any stage of training. SPA leverages a standardized computational graph and ONNX representation to prune diverse neural network architectures without the need for manual intervention. SPA employs a group-level importance estimation method, which groups dependent computational operators, estimates their importance, and prunes unimportant coupled channels. This enables the transfer of various existing pruning criteria into a structured group style. As a result, SPA supports pruning at any time, either before training, after training with fine-tuning, or after training without fine-tuning. In the context of the latter, we introduce Optimal Brain SPA (OBSPA), an algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art pruning results needing neither fine-tuning nor calibration data. In extensive experiments, SPA shows competitive to state-of-the-art pruning performance across various architectures, from popular frameworks, at different pruning times."}

Previous results showed that pruning is possible with minimum performance loss by utilizing a reinforcement learning agent which makes decisions about the sparsity level of each neural layer by maximizing as a reward the accuracy of the network. We introduce a novel information-theoretic reward function which minimizes the spatial entropy of convolutional activations. This minimization ultimately acts as a proxy for maintaining accuracy, although these two criteria are not related in any way. Our method shows that there is another possibility to preserve accuracy without the need to directly optimize it in the agent's reward function. In our experiments, we were able to reduce the total number of FLOPS of multiple popular neural network architectures by 5-10x, incurring minimal or no performance drop and being on par with the solution found by maximizing the accuracy."}

Empirical results demonstrate its exceptional compression capability, maintaining high accuracy on the MNIST dataset with only 0.15\\% of the original network parameters. Moreover, our framework enhances neural network interpretability, not only by allowing easy extraction of feature importance directly from the pruned network but also by enabling visualization of feature symmetry and the pathways of information propagation from features to outcomes.

To combat this, one of the most effective compression techniques -- channel pruning -- removes channels from weights. However, for multi-branch segments of a model, channel removal can introduce inference-time memory copies. In turn, these copies increase inference latency -- so much so that the pruned model can be slower than the unpruned model. As a workaround, pruners conventionally constrain certain channels to be pruned together. This fully eliminates memory copies but, as we show, significantly impairs accuracy. We now have a dilemma: Remove constraints but increase latency, or add constraints and impair accuracy. In response, our insight is to reorder channels at export time, (1) reducing latency by reducing memory copies and (2) improving accuracy by removing constraints. Using this insight, we design a generic algorithm UPSCALE to prune models with any pruning pattern. By removing constraints from existing pruners, we improve ImageNet accuracy for post-training pruned models by 2.1 points on average -- benefiting DenseNet (+16.9), EfficientNetV2 (+7.9), and ResNet (+6.2). Furthermore, by reordering channels, UPSCALE improves inference speeds by up to 2x over a baseline export."}

To demonstrate the practicality of the pruning method, we select the YOLOv5 model for experiments and provide a data set of outdoor obstacles to show the effect of model. In this specific data set, in the best circumstances, the volume of the network model is reduced by 49.7% compared with the original model, and the reasoning time is reduced by 52.5%.

In this work, we conduct pruning on real and quaternion-valued implementations of different architectures on classification tasks. We find that for some architectures, at very high sparsity levels, quaternion models provide higher accuracies than their real counterparts. For example, at the task of image classification on CIFAR-10 using Conv-4, at $3\\%$ of the number of parameters as the original model, the pruned quaternion version outperforms the pruned real by more than $10\\%$.

Moreover, with the development of technology, more and more embedded devices are available to run a Transformer model. For a Transformer model with different constraints (tight or loose), it can be deployed onto devices with different computing power. However, in previous work, designers did not choose the best device among multiple devices. Instead, they just used an existing device to deploy model, which was not necessarily the best fit and may lead to underutilization of resources. To address the deployment challenge of Transformer and the problem to select the best device, we propose an algorithm & hardware closed-loop acceleration framework. Given a dataset, a model, latency constraint LC and accuracy constraint AC, our framework can provide a best device satisfying both constraints. In order to generate a compressed model with high sparsity ratio, we propose a novel pruning technique, hierarchical pruning (HP). We optimize the sparse matrix storage format for HP matrix to further reduce memory usage for FPGA implementation. We design a accelerator that takes advantage of HP to solve the problem of concurrent random access. Experiments on Transformer and TinyBert model show that our framework can find different devices for various LC and AC, covering from low-end devices to high-end devices.

Despite this, existing methods struggle to enhance robustness against adversarial attacks when continually increasing model sparsity and require a retraining process. As humans step into the era of large language models, these issues become increasingly prominent. This paper proposes that the robustness of language models is proportional to the extent of pre-trained knowledge they encompass. Accordingly, we introduce a post-training pruning strategy designed to faithfully replicate the embedding space and feature space of dense language models, aiming to conserve more pre-trained knowledge during the pruning process. In this setup, each layer's reconstruction error not only originates from itself but also includes cumulative error from preceding layers, followed by an adaptive rectification. Compared to other state-of-art baselines, our approach demonstrates a superior balance between accuracy, sparsity, robustness, and pruning cost with BERT on datasets SST2, IMDB, and AGNews, marking a significant stride towards robust pruning in language models."}

In this paper, we present ChipNet, a deterministic pruning strategy that employs continuous Heaviside function and a novel crispness loss to identify a highly sparse network out of an existing dense network. Our choice of continuous Heaviside function is inspired by the field of design optimization, where the material distribution task is posed as a continuous optimization problem, but only discrete values (0 or 1) are practically feasible and expected as final outcomes. Our approach's flexible design facilitates its use with different choices of budget constraints while maintaining stability for very low target budgets. Experimental results show that ChipNet outperforms state-of-the-art structured pruning methods by remarkable margins of up to 16.1% in terms of accuracy. Further, we show that the masks obtained with ChipNet are transferable across datasets. For certain cases, it was observed that masks transferred from a model trained on feature-rich teacher dataset provide better performance on the student dataset than those obtained by directly pruning on the student data itself."}

They typically use the pruning technique to reduce the size and complexity of the model, generating a lighter one with less resource consumption. Nonetheless, most existing pruning methods are proposed with the premise that the model after being pruned has a chance to be fine-tuned or even retrained based on the original training data. This may be unrealistic in practice, as the data controllers are often reluctant to provide their model consumers with the original data. In this work, we study the neural network pruning in the data-free context, aiming to yield lightweight models that are not only accurate in prediction but also robust against undesired inputs in open-world deployments. Considering the absence of the fine-tuning and retraining that can fix the mis-pruned units, we replace the traditional aggressive one-shot strategy with a conservative one that treats the pruning as a progressive process. We propose a pruning method based on stochastic optimization that uses robustness-related metrics to guide the pruning process. Our method is implemented as a Python program and evaluated with a series of experiments on diverse neural network models.

Previous first-order methods successfully compress PLMs to extremely high sparsity with little performance drop. These methods, such as movement pruning, use first-order information to prune PLMs while fine-tuning the remaining weights. In this work, we argue fine-tuning is redundant for first-order pruning, since first-order pruning is sufficient to converge PLMs to downstream tasks without fine-tuning. Under this motivation, we propose Static Model Pruning (SMP), which only uses first-order pruning to adapt PLMs to downstream tasks while achieving the target sparsity level. In addition, we also design a new masking function and training objective to further improve SMP. Extensive experiments at various sparsity levels show SMP has significant improvements over first-order and zero-order methods.

This study challenges the practice of retraining all parameters by showing that updating a small subset of highly expressive parameters can suffice to recover or even enhance performance after pruning. Surprisingly, retraining just 0.01%-0.05% of the parameters in GPT-architectures can match the performance of full retraining across various sparsity levels, significantly reducing compute and memory requirements, and enabling retraining of models with up to 30 billion parameters on a single GPU in minutes. To bridge the gap to full retraining in the high sparsity regime, we introduce two novel LoRA variants that, unlike standard LoRA, allow merging adapters back without compromising sparsity.

To fill this gap, we perform the first analysis of pruning's effect on neural networks trained to diagnose thorax diseases from chest X-rays (CXRs). On two large CXR datasets, we examine which diseases are most affected by pruning and characterize class \"forgettability\" based on disease frequency and co-occurrence behavior. Further, we identify individual CXRs where uncompressed and heavily pruned models disagree, known as pruning-identified exemplars (PIEs), and conduct a human reader study to evaluate their unifying qualities.

A common problem in both pruning and distillation is to determine compressed architecture, i.e., the exact number of filters per layer and layer configuration, in order to preserve most of the original model capacity. In spite of the great advances in existing works, the determination of an excellent architecture still requires human interference or tremendous experimentations. In this paper, we propose an architecture slimming method that automates the layer configuration process. We start from the perspective that the capacity of the over-parameterized model can be largely preserved by finding the minimum number of filters preserving the maximum parameter variance per layer, resulting in a thin architecture. We formulate the determination of compressed architecture as a one-step orthogonal linear transformation, and integrate principle component analysis (PCA), where the variances of filters in the first several projections are maximized. We demonstrate the rationality of our analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed method through extensive experiments. In particular, we show that under the same overall compression rate, the compressed architecture determined by our method shows significant performance gain over baselines after pruning and distillation. Surprisingly, we find that the resulting layer-wise compression rates correspond to the layer sensitivities found by existing works through tremendous experimentations."}

Specifically, the accuracy of the pruned model with 16.56% parameters decreases by 0.28% only, which is better than the widely used popular filter pruning criteria."}

Perhaps surprisingly, a systematic approach to predict precisely how adjusting a specific hyperparameter will affect prunability remains elusive. To address this gap, we introduce a phenomenological model grounded in the statistical mechanics of learning. Our approach uses temperature-like and load-like parameters to model the impact of neural network (NN) training hyperparameters on pruning performance. A key empirical result we identify is a sharp transition phenomenon: depending on the value of a load-like parameter in the pruned model, increasing the value of a temperature-like parameter in the pre-pruned model may either enhance or impair subsequent pruning performance. Based on this transition, we build a three-regime model by taxonomizing the global structure of the pruned NN loss landscape. Our model reveals that the dichotomous effect of high temperature is associated with transitions between distinct types of global structures in the post-pruned model. Based on our results, we present three case-studies: 1) determining whether to increase or decrease a hyperparameter for improved pruning; 2) selecting the best model to prune from a family of models; and 3) tuning the hyperparameter of the Sharpness Aware Minimization method for better pruning performance."}

Most available filter pruning methods require complex treatments such as iterative pruning, features statistics/ranking, or additional optimization designs in the training process. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective regularization strategy from a new perspective of evolution of features, which we call feature flow regularization (FFR), for improving structured sparsity and filter pruning in DNNs. Specifically, FFR imposes controls on the gradient and curvature of feature flow along the neural network, which implicitly increases the sparsity of the parameters. The principle behind FFR is that coherent and smooth evolution of features will lead to an efficient network that avoids redundant parameters. The high structured sparsity obtained from FFR enables us to prune filters effectively. Experiments with VGGNets, ResNets on CIFAR-10/100, and Tiny ImageNet datasets demonstrate that FFR can significantly improve both unstructured and structured sparsity. Our pruning results in terms of reduction of parameters and FLOPs are comparable to or even better than those of state-of-the-art pruning methods."}

A typical approach to pruning starts by training a model and then removing redundant parameters while minimizing the impact on what is learned. Alternatively, a recent approach shows that pruning can be done at initialization prior to training, based on a saliency criterion called connection sensitivity. However, it remains unclear exactly why pruning an untrained, randomly initialized neural network is effective. In this work, by noting connection sensitivity as a form of gradient, we formally characterize initialization conditions to ensure reliable connection sensitivity measurements, which in turn yields effective pruning results. Moreover, we analyze the signal propagation properties of the resulting pruned networks and introduce a simple, data-free method to improve their trainability. Our modifications to the existing pruning at initialization method lead to improved results on all tested network models for image classification tasks. Furthermore, we empirically study the effect of supervision for pruning and demonstrate that our signal propagation perspective, combined with unsupervised pruning, can be useful in various scenarios where pruning is applied to non-standard arbitrarily-designed architectures."}

However, the fundamental limit of network pruning is still lacking. To close the gap, in this work we'll take a first-principles approach, i.e. we'll directly impose the sparsity constraint on the loss function and leverage the framework of statistical dimension in convex geometry, thus enabling us to characterize the sharp phase transition point, which can be regarded as the fundamental limit of the pruning ratio. Through this limit, we're able to identify two key factors that determine the pruning ratio limit, namely, weight magnitude and network sharpness. Generally speaking, the flatter the loss landscape or the smaller the weight magnitude, the smaller pruning ratio. Moreover, we provide efficient countermeasures to address the challenges in the computation of the pruning limit, which mainly involves the accurate spectrum estimation of a large-scale and non-positive Hessian matrix. Moreover, through the lens of the pruning ratio threshold, we can also provide rigorous interpretations on several heuristics in existing pruning algorithms.

The usual pruning pipeline consists of ranking the network internal filters and activations with respect to their contributions to the network performance, removing the units with the lowest contribution, and fine-tuning the network to reduce the harm induced by pruning. Recent results showed that random pruning performs on par with other metrics, given enough fine-tuning resources. In this work, we show that this is not true on a low-data regime when fine-tuning is either not possible or not effective. In this case, reducing the harm caused by pruning becomes crucial to retain the performance of the network. First, we analyze the problem of estimating the contribution of hidden units with tools suggested by cooperative game theory and propose Shapley values as a principled ranking metric for this task. We compare with several alternatives proposed in the literature and discuss how Shapley values are theoretically preferable. Finally, we compare all ranking metrics on the challenging scenario of low-data pruning, where we demonstrate how Shapley values outperform other heuristics."}

However, to the best of our knowledge, no existing block pruning algorithm satisfies all three requirements simultaneously. In this paper, we introduce SMART (Separate, Dynamic, and Differentiable) pruning, a novel algorithm designed to address this gap. SMART leverages both weight and activation information to enhance accuracy, employs a differentiable top-k operator for precise control of resource constraints, and offers convergence guarantees under mild conditions.

Network pruning offers a solution to reduce model size and computational cost while maintaining performance. However, most current pruning methods focus primarily on improving sparsity by reducing the number of nonzero parameters, often neglecting other deployment costs such as inference time, which are closely related to the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs). In this paper, we propose FALCON, a novel combinatorial-optimization-based framework for network pruning that jointly takes into account model accuracy (fidelity), FLOPs, and sparsity constraints. A main building block of our approach is an integer linear program (ILP) that simultaneously handles FLOP and sparsity constraints. We present a novel algorithm to approximately solve the ILP. We propose a novel first-order method for our optimization framework which makes use of our ILP solver. Using problem structure (e.g., the low-rank structure of approx. Hessian), we can address instances with millions of parameters. Our experiments demonstrate that FALCON achieves superior accuracy compared to other pruning approaches within a fixed FLOP budget. For instance, for ResNet50 with 20% of the total FLOPs retained, our approach improves the accuracy by 48% relative to state-of-the-art. Furthermore, in gradual pruning settings with re-training between pruning steps, our framework outperforms existing pruning methods, emphasizing the significance of incorporating both FLOP and sparsity constraints for effective network pruning."}

In this paper, we devise an alternative pruning method that allows extracting effective subnetworks from larger untrained ones. Our method is stochastic and extracts subnetworks by exploring different topologies which are sampled using Gumbel Softmax. The latter is also used to train probability distributions which measure the relevance of weights in the sampled topologies. The resulting subnetworks are further enhanced using a highly efficient rescaling mechanism that reduces training time and improves performance.

Large numbers of parameters can be removed from trained models with little discernible loss in accuracy after a small number of continued training epochs. However, pruning too many parameters at once often causes an initial steep drop in accuracy which can undermine convergence quality. Iterative pruning approaches mitigate this by gradually removing a small number of parameters over multiple epochs. However, this can still lead to subnetworks that overfit local regions of the loss landscape. We introduce a novel and effective approach to tuning subnetworks through a regularization technique we call Stochastic Subnetwork Annealing. Instead of removing parameters in a discrete manner, we instead represent subnetworks with stochastic masks where each parameter has a probabilistic chance of being included or excluded on any given forward pass. We anneal these probabilities over time such that subnetwork structure slowly evolves as mask values become more deterministic, allowing for a smoother and more robust optimization of subnetworks at high levels of sparsity."}

It is thus imperative to develop efficient models, especially for deploying AI solutions under resource-constrains or with time sensitivity. One potential solution is to perform model compression, a set of techniques that remove less important model components or reduce parameter precision, to reduce model computation demand. In this work, we demonstrate that model pruning, as a model compression technique, can effectively reduce inference cost for computational and digital pathology based analysis with a negligible loss of analysis performance. To this end, we develop a methodology for pruning the widely used U-Net-style architectures in biomedical imaging, with which we evaluate multiple pruning heuristics on nuclei instance segmentation and classification, and empirically demonstrate that pruning can compress models by at least 70% with a negligible drop in performance."}

Model pruning is an effective technique to reduce computation overhead for deep neural networks by removing redundant parameters. However, modern recommendation systems are still thirsty for model capacity due to the demand for handling big data. Thus, pruning a recommendation model at scale results in a smaller model capacity and consequently lower accuracy. To reduce computation cost without sacrificing model capacity, we propose a dynamic training scheme, namely alternate model growth and pruning, to alternatively construct and prune weights in the course of training. Our method leverages structured sparsification to reduce computational cost without hurting the model capacity at the end of offline training so that a full-size model is available in the recurring training stage to learn new data in real-time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide in-depth experiments and discussion of applying structural dynamics to recommendation systems at scale to reduce training cost. The proposed method is validated with an open-source deep-learning recommendation model (DLRM) and state-of-the-art industrial-scale production models."}

However, such a pruning policy often leads to excessive reduction of that dimension, thus inducing a huge accuracy loss. To alleviate this issue, we argue that pruning should be conducted along three dimensions comprehensively. For this purpose, our pruning framework formulates pruning as an optimization problem. Specifically, it first casts the relationships between a certain model's accuracy and depth/width/resolution into a polynomial regression and then maximizes the polynomial to acquire the optimal values for the three dimensions. Finally, the model is pruned along the three optimal dimensions accordingly. In this framework, since collecting too much data for training the regression is very time-costly, we propose two approaches to lower the cost: 1) specializing the polynomial to ensure an accurate regression even with less training data; 2) employing iterative pruning and fine-tuning to collect the data faster. Extensive experiments show that our proposed algorithm surpasses state-of-the-art pruning algorithms and even neural architecture search-based algorithms."}

Numerous studies in the literature have developed such formulations for many ML predictors, with a particular emphasis on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) due to their significant interest in many applications. However, ANNs frequently contain a large number of parameters, resulting in MIP formulations that are impractical to solve, thereby impeding scalability. In fact, the ML community has already introduced several techniques to reduce the parameter count of ANNs without compromising their performance, since the substantial size of modern ANNs presents challenges for ML applications as it significantly impacts computational efforts during training and necessitates significant memory resources for storage. In this paper, we showcase the effectiveness of pruning, one of these techniques, when applied to ANNs prior to their integration into MIPs. By pruning the ANN, we achieve significant improvements in the speed of the solution process. We discuss why pruning is more suitable in this context compared to other ML compression techniques, and we identify the most appropriate pruning strategies.

There are currently two mainstreams of pruning methods representing two extremes of pruning regularity: non-structured, fine-grained pruning can achieve high sparsity and accuracy, but is not hardware friendly; structured, coarse-grained pruning exploits hardware-efficient structures in pruning, but suffers from accuracy drop when the pruning rate is high. In this paper, we introduce PCONV, comprising a new sparsity dimension, -- fine-grained pruning patterns inside the coarse-grained structures. PCONV comprises two types of sparsities, Sparse Convolution Patterns (SCP) which is generated from intra-convolution kernel pruning and connectivity sparsity generated from inter-convolution kernel pruning. Essentially, SCP enhances accuracy due to its special vision properties, and connectivity sparsity increases pruning rate while maintaining balanced workload on filter computation. To deploy PCONV, we develop a novel compiler-assisted DNN inference framework and execute PCONV models in real-time without accuracy compromise, which cannot be achieved in prior work.

To this end, we propose a Rank-based PruninG (RPG) method to maintain the ranks of sparse weights in an adversarial manner.

It allows to lower the complexity of the network by introducing sparsity in the weights. Because taking advantage of sparse matrices is still challenging, pruning is often performed in a structured way, i.e. removing entire convolution filters in the case of ConvNets, according to a chosen pruning criteria. Common pruning criteria, such as l1-norm or movement, usually do not consider the individual utility of filters, which may lead to: (1) the removal of filters exhibiting rare, thus important and discriminative behaviour, and (2) the retaining of filters with redundant information. In this paper, we present a technique solving those two issues, and which can be appended to any pruning criteria. This technique ensures that the criteria of selection focuses on redundant filters, while retaining the rare ones, thus maximizing the variety of remaining filters. The experimental results, carried out on different datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and CALTECH-101) and using different architectures (VGG-16 and ResNet-18) demonstrate that it is possible to achieve similar sparsity levels while maintaining a higher performance when appending our filter selection technique to pruning criteria.

However, identifying redundant filters is a core problem in structured network pruning, and current redundancy criteria only focus on individual filters' attributes. When pruning sparsity increases, these redundancy criteria are not effective or efficient enough. Since the filter-wise interaction also contributes to the CNN's prediction accuracy, we integrate the filter-wise interaction into the redundancy criterion. In our criterion, we introduce the filter importance and filter utilization strength to reflect the decision ability of individual and multiple filters. Utilizing this new redundancy criterion, we propose a structured network pruning approach SNPFI (Structured Network Pruning by measuring Filter-wise Interaction). During the pruning, the SNPFI can automatically assign the proper sparsity based on the filter utilization strength and eliminate the useless filters by filter importance. After the pruning, the SNPFI can recover pruned model's performance effectively without iterative training by minimizing the interaction difference. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the SNPFI with several commonly used CNN models, including AlexNet, MobileNetv1, and ResNet-50, on various image classification datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet.
