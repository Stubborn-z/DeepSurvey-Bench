In this survey, we discuss over 250 recent studies of English language model behavior before task-specific fine-tuning. Language models possess basic capabilities in syntax, semantics, pragmatics, world knowledge, and reasoning, but these capabilities are sensitive to specific inputs and surface features. Despite dramatic increases in generated text quality as models scale to hundreds of billions of parameters, the models are still prone to unfactual responses, commonsense errors, memorized text, and social biases. Many of these weaknesses can be framed as over-generalizations or under-generalizations of learned patterns in text. We synthesize recent results to highlight what is currently known about large language model capabilities, thus providing a resource for applied work and for research in adjacent fields that use language models."}

We investigate the downstream performance achievable with a transformer-based language model trained completely from scratch with masked language modeling for a single day on a single consumer GPU. Aside from re-analyzing nearly all components of the pretraining pipeline for this scenario and providing a modified pipeline with performance close to BERT, we investigate why scaling down is hard, and which modifications actually improve performance in this scenario.

An Empirical Comparison for Transformer Training", "abstract": "Multi-head attention plays a crucial role in the recent success of Transformer models, which leads to consistent performance improvements over conventional attention in various applications. The popular belief is that this effectiveness stems from the ability of jointly attending multiple positions. In this paper, we first demonstrate that jointly attending multiple positions is not a unique feature of multi-head attention, as multi-layer single-head attention also attends multiple positions and is more effective. Then, we suggest the main advantage of the multi-head attention is the training stability, since it has less number of layers than the single-head attention, when attending the same number of positions. For example, 24-layer 16-head Transformer (BERT-large) and 384-layer single-head Transformer has the same total attention head number and roughly the same model size, while the multi-head one is significantly shallower. Meanwhile, we show that, with recent advances in deep learning, we can successfully stabilize the training of the 384-layer Transformer. As the training difficulty is no longer a bottleneck, substantially deeper single-head Transformer achieves consistent performance improvements without tuning hyper-parameters."}

In this paper, we present a simple yet informative decomposition of hidden states (or embeddings) of trained transformers into interpretable components. For any layer, embedding vectors of input sequence samples are represented by a tensor $\\boldsymbol{h} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{C \\times T \\times d}$. Given embedding vector $\\boldsymbol{h}_{c,t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ at sequence position $t \\le T$ in a sequence (or context) $c \\le C$, extracting the mean effects yields the decomposition \\[ \\boldsymbol{h}_{c,t} = \\boldsymbolμ + \\mathbf{pos}_t + \\mathbf{ctx}_c + \\mathbf{resid}_{c,t} \\] where $\\boldsymbolμ$ is the global mean vector, $\\mathbf{pos}_t$ and $\\mathbf{ctx}_c$ are the mean vectors across contexts and across positions respectively, and $\\mathbf{resid}_{c,t}$ is the residual vector. For popular transformer architectures and diverse text datasets, empirically we find pervasive mathematical structure: (1) $(\\mathbf{pos}_t)_{t}$ forms a low-dimensional, continuous, and often spiral shape across layers, (2) $(\\mathbf{ctx}_c)_c$ shows clear cluster structure that falls into context topics, and (3) $(\\mathbf{pos}_t)_{t}$ and $(\\mathbf{ctx}_c)_c$ are mutually nearly orthogonal. We argue that smoothness is pervasive and beneficial to transformers trained on languages, and our decomposition leads to improved model interpretability."}

By probing and analyzing what BERT has already known when solving this task, we obtain better understanding of what task-specific knowledge BERT needs the most and where it is most needed. The analysis further motivates us to take a different approach than most existing works. Instead of using prior knowledge to create a new training task for fine-tuning BERT, we directly inject knowledge into BERT's multi-head attention mechanism. This leads us to a simple yet effective approach that enjoys fast training stage as it saves the model from training on additional data or tasks other than the main task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed knowledge-enhanced BERT is able to consistently improve semantic textual matching performance over the original BERT model, and the performance benefit is most salient when training data is scarce."}

A Case Study on Learning with Representations", "abstract": "While large language models based on the transformer architecture have demonstrated remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, understandings of such capabilities are still in an early stage, where existing theory and mechanistic understanding focus mostly on simple scenarios such as learning simple function classes. This paper takes initial steps on understanding ICL in more complex scenarios, by studying learning with representations. Concretely, we construct synthetic in-context learning problems with a compositional structure, where the label depends on the input through a possibly complex but fixed representation function, composed with a linear function that differs in each instance. By construction, the optimal ICL algorithm first transforms the inputs by the representation function, and then performs linear ICL on top of the transformed dataset. We show theoretically the existence of transformers that approximately implement such algorithms with mild depth and size. Empirically, we find trained transformers consistently achieve near-optimal ICL performance in this setting, and exhibit the desired dissection where lower layers transforms the dataset and upper layers perform linear ICL. Through extensive probing and a new pasting experiment, we further reveal several mechanisms within the trained transformers, such as concrete copying behaviors on both the inputs and the representations, linear ICL capability of the upper layers alone, and a post-ICL representation selection mechanism in a harder mixture setting. These observed mechanisms align well with our theory and may shed light on how transformers perform ICL in more realistic scenarios."}

The loss scales as a power-law with model size, dataset size, and the amount of compute used for training, with some trends spanning more than seven orders of magnitude. Other architectural details such as network width or depth have minimal effects within a wide range. Simple equations govern the dependence of overfitting on model/dataset size and the dependence of training speed on model size. These relationships allow us to determine the optimal allocation of a fixed compute budget. Larger models are significantly more sample-efficient, such that optimally compute-efficient training involves training very large models on a relatively modest amount of data and stopping significantly before convergence."}

Here, we investigate the structure of LLM capabilities by extracting latent capabilities from patterns of individual differences across a varied population of LLMs. Using a combination of Bayesian and frequentist factor analysis, we analyzed data from 29 different LLMs across 27 cognitive tasks. We found evidence that LLM capabilities are not monolithic. Instead, they are better explained by three well-delineated factors that represent reasoning, comprehension and core language modeling. Moreover, we found that these three factors can explain a high proportion of the variance in model performance. These results reveal a consistent structure in the capabilities of different LLMs and demonstrate the multifaceted nature of these capabilities. We also found that the three abilities show different relationships to model properties such as model size and instruction tuning. These patterns help refine our understanding of scaling laws and indicate that changes to a model that improve one ability might simultaneously impair others. Based on these findings, we suggest that benchmarks could be streamlined by focusing on tasks that tap into each broad model ability."}

Though the trade-off between performance and efficiency is well-known, there is still much to be learned about the relationship between quantization and LLM performance. To shed light on this relationship, we propose a new perspective on quantization, viewing it as perturbations added to the weights and activations of LLMs. We call this approach \"the lens of perturbation\". Using this lens, we conduct experiments with various artificial perturbations to explore their impact on LLM performance. Our findings reveal several connections between the properties of perturbations and LLM performance, providing insights into the failure cases of uniform quantization and suggesting potential solutions to improve the robustness of LLM quantization. To demonstrate the significance of our findings, we implement a simple non-uniform quantization approach based on our insights. Our experiments show that this approach achieves minimal performance degradation on both 4-bit weight quantization and 8-bit quantization for weights and activations. These results validate the correctness of our approach and highlight its potential to improve the efficiency of LLMs without sacrificing performance."}

We incorporate a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) closed-loop feedback control system with a reference point into the model to improve robustness and representation capacity. This integration aims to preserve high-frequency details while bolstering model stability, rendering it more noise-resilient. The resulting controlled state-space model is theoretically proven robust and adept at addressing the rank collapse. Motivated by this control framework, we derive a novel class of transformers, PID-controlled Transformer (PIDformer), aimed at improving robustness and mitigating the rank-collapse issue inherent in softmax transformers.

However, its application encounters challenges attributed to the substantial computational intricacies intrinsic to its attention mechanism. Moreover, its reliance on high-precision floating-point operations presents specific hurdles, particularly evident in computation-intensive scenarios such as edge computing environments. These environments, characterized by resource-constrained devices and a preference for lower precision, necessitate innovative solutions. To tackle the exacting data processing demands posed by edge devices, we introduce the Bitformer model, an inventive extension of the Transformer paradigm. Central to this innovation is a novel attention mechanism that adeptly replaces conventional floating-point matrix multiplication with bitwise operations. This strategic substitution yields dual advantages. Not only does it maintain the attention mechanism's prowess in capturing intricate long-range information dependencies, but it also orchestrates a profound reduction in the computational complexity inherent in the attention operation. The transition from an $O(n^2d)$ complexity, typical of floating-point operations, to an $O(n^2T)$ complexity characterizing bitwise operations, substantiates this advantage. Notably, in this context, the parameter $T$ remains markedly smaller than the conventional dimensionality parameter $d$. The Bitformer model in essence endeavors to reconcile the indomitable requirements of modern computing landscapes with the constraints posed by edge computing scenarios. By forging this innovative path, we bridge the gap between high-performing models and resource-scarce environments, thus unveiling a promising trajectory for further advancements in the field."}

Motivated by this approach, we propose Cross-Architecture Transfer Learning (XATL), in which the weights of the shared components between LCI and self-attention-based transformers, such as layernorms, MLPs, input/output embeddings, are directly transferred to the new architecture from already pre-trained model parameters. We experimented the efficacy of the method on varying sizes and alternative attention architectures and show that \\methodabbr significantly reduces the training time up to 2.5x times and converges to a better minimum with up to 2.6% stronger model on the LM benchmarks within the same compute budget."}

Pre-trained models can be potentially used for downstream tasks such as regression and classification, forecasting and missing value imputation. By evaluating our models on several benchmark datasets for multivariate time series regression and classification, we show that not only does our modeling approach represent the most successful method employing unsupervised learning of multivariate time series presented to date, but also that it exceeds the current state-of-the-art performance of supervised methods; it does so even when the number of training samples is very limited, while offering computational efficiency. Finally, we demonstrate that unsupervised pre-training of our transformer models offers a substantial performance benefit over fully supervised learning, even without leveraging additional unlabeled data, i.e., by reusing the same data samples through the unsupervised objective."}

Besides the quadratic computational and memory complexity w.r.t the sequence length, the self-attention mechanism only processes information at the same scale, i.e., all attention heads are in the same resolution, resulting in the limited power of the Transformer. To remedy this, we propose a novel and efficient structure named Adaptive Multi-Resolution Attention (AdaMRA for short), which scales linearly to sequence length in terms of time and space. Specifically, we leverage a multi-resolution multi-head attention mechanism, enabling attention heads to capture long-range contextual information in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Moreover, to capture the potential relations between query representation and clues of different attention granularities, we leave the decision of which resolution of attention to use to query, which further improves the model's capacity compared to vanilla Transformer. In an effort to reduce complexity, we adopt kernel attention without degrading the performance. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our model by achieving a state-of-the-art performance-efficiency-memory trade-off. To facilitate AdaMRA utilization by the scientific community, the code implementation will be made publicly available."}
{"id": "37", "arxiv": "2110.09419v2", "title": "Compositional Attention: Disentangling Search and Retrieval", "abstract": "Multi-head, key-value attention is the backbone of the widely successful Transformer model and its variants. This attention mechanism uses multiple parallel key-value attention blocks (called heads), each performing two fundamental computations: (1) search - selection of a relevant entity from a set via query-key interactions, and (2) retrieval - extraction of relevant features from the selected entity via a value matrix. Importantly, standard attention heads learn a rigid mapping between search and retrieval. In this work, we first highlight how this static nature of the pairing can potentially: (a) lead to learning of redundant parameters in certain tasks, and (b) hinder generalization. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure. The proposed mechanism disentangles search and retrieval and composes them in a dynamic, flexible and context-dependent manner through an additional soft competition stage between the query-key combination and value pairing. Through a series of numerical experiments, we show that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings. Through our qualitative analysis, we demonstrate that Compositional Attention leads to dynamic specialization based on the type of retrieval needed. Our proposed mechanism generalizes multi-head attention, allows independent scaling of search and retrieval, and can easily be implemented in lieu of standard attention heads in any network architecture."}

The transformer, which is a sequence model solely based on self-attention, and its variants achieved state-of-the-art results in many natural language processing tasks. Since music composes its semantics based on the relations between components in sparse positions, adopting the self-attention mechanism to solve music information retrieval (MIR) problems can be beneficial. Hence, we propose a self-attention based deep sequence model for music tagging. The proposed architecture consists of shallow convolutional layers followed by stacked Transformer encoders. Compared to conventional approaches using fully convolutional or recurrent neural networks, our model is more interpretable while reporting competitive results. We validate the performance of our model with the MagnaTagATune and the Million Song Dataset. In addition, we demonstrate the interpretability of the proposed architecture with a heat map visualization."}
{"id": "39", "arxiv": "2103.00336v1", "title": "Transformers with Competitive Ensembles of Independent Mechanisms", "abstract": "An important development in deep learning from the earliest MLPs has been a move towards architectures with structural inductive biases which enable the model to keep distinct sources of information and routes of processing well-separated. This structure is linked to the notion of independent mechanisms from the causality literature, in which a mechanism is able to retain the same processing as irrelevant aspects of the world are changed. For example, convnets enable separation over positions, while attention-based architectures (especially Transformers) learn which combination of positions to process dynamically. In this work we explore a way in which the Transformer architecture is deficient: it represents each position with a large monolithic hidden representation and a single set of parameters which are applied over the entire hidden representation. This potentially throws unrelated sources of information together, and limits the Transformer's ability to capture independent mechanisms. To address this, we propose Transformers with Independent Mechanisms (TIM), a new Transformer layer which divides the hidden representation and parameters into multiple mechanisms, which only exchange information through attention. Additionally, we propose a competition mechanism which encourages these mechanisms to specialize over time steps, and thus be more independent. We study TIM on a large-scale BERT model, on the Image Transformer, and on speech enhancement and find evidence for semantically meaningful specialization as well as improved performance."}

However, conventional self-attention mechanisms are originally designed for modeling textual sequence without considering the characteristics of speech and speaker modeling. Besides, different Transformer variants for speaker recognition have not been well studied. In this work, we propose a novel multi-view self-attention mechanism and present an empirical study of different Transformer variants with or without the proposed attention mechanism for speaker recognition. Specifically, to balance the capabilities of capturing global dependencies and modeling the locality, we propose a multi-view self-attention mechanism for speaker Transformer, in which different attention heads can attend to different ranges of the receptive field. Furthermore, we introduce and compare five Transformer variants with different network architectures, embedding locations, and pooling methods to learn speaker embeddings. Experimental results on the VoxCeleb1 and VoxCeleb2 datasets show that the proposed multi-view self-attention mechanism achieves improvement in the performance of speaker recognition, and the proposed speaker Transformer network attains excellent results compared with state-of-the-art models."}
{"id": "41", "arxiv": "2403.17729v2", "title": "EulerFormer: Sequential User Behavior Modeling with Complex Vector Attention", "abstract": "To capture user preference, transformer models have been widely applied to model sequential user behavior data. The core of transformer architecture lies in the self-attention mechanism, which computes the pairwise attention scores in a sequence. Due to the permutation-equivariant nature, positional encoding is used to enhance the attention between token representations. In this setting, the pairwise attention scores can be derived by both semantic difference and positional difference. However, prior studies often model the two kinds of difference measurements in different ways, which potentially limits the expressive capacity of sequence modeling. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel transformer variant with complex vector attention, named EulerFormer, which provides a unified theoretical framework to formulate both semantic difference and positional difference. The EulerFormer involves two key technical improvements. First, it employs a new transformation function for efficiently transforming the sequence tokens into polar-form complex vectors using Euler's formula, enabling the unified modeling of both semantic and positional information in a complex rotation form.Secondly, it develops a differential rotation mechanism, where the semantic rotation angles can be controlled by an adaptation function, enabling the adaptive integration of the semantic and positional information according to the semantic contexts.Furthermore, a phase contrastive learning task is proposed to improve the isotropy of contextual representations in EulerFormer. Our theoretical framework possesses a high degree of completeness and generality. It is more robust to semantic variations and possesses moresuperior theoretical properties in principle. Extensive experiments conducted on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach."}

It has been observed that for many applications, those attention heads learn redundant embedding, and most of them can be removed without degrading the performance of the model. Inspired by this observation, we propose Transformer with a Mixture of Gaussian Keys (Transformer-MGK), a novel transformer architecture that replaces redundant heads in transformers with a mixture of keys at each head. These mixtures of keys follow a Gaussian mixture model and allow each attention head to focus on different parts of the input sequence efficiently. Compared to its conventional transformer counterpart, Transformer-MGK accelerates training and inference, has fewer parameters, and requires fewer FLOPs to compute while achieving comparable or better accuracy across tasks. Transformer-MGK can also be easily extended to use with linear attention. We empirically demonstrate the advantage of Transformer-MGK in a range of practical applications, including language modeling and tasks that involve very long sequences. On the Wikitext-103 and Long Range Arena benchmark, Transformer-MGKs with 4 heads attain comparable or better performance to the baseline transformers with 8 heads."}

We introduce Fast Multipole Attention (FMA), a divide-and-conquer mechanism for self-attention inspired by the Fast Multipole Method from n-body physics. FMA reduces the time and memory complexity of self-attention from $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^2\\right)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(n \\log n)$ and $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ while preserving full-context interactions. FMA contains a learned hierarchy with $\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$ levels of resolution. In this hierarchy, nearby tokens interact at full resolution, while distant tokens engage through progressively coarser, learned basis functions. We have developed both 1D and 2D implementations of FMA for language and vision tasks, respectively. On autoregressive and bidirectional language modeling benchmarks, the 1D variant either matches or outperforms leading efficient attention baselines with substantially lower memory use. With linear complexity, the 2D variant demonstrates superior performance over strong vision transformer baselines in classification and semantic segmentation tasks. Our results confirm that the multilevel attention implemented by FMA allows Transformer-based models to scale to much longer sequences and higher-resolution inputs without loss in accuracy. This provides a principled, physics-inspired approach for developing scalable neural networks suitable for language, vision, and multimodal tasks. Our code will be available at https://github.com/epoch98/FMA."}

These attention modules also play a role in other computer vision tasks including object detection and image segmentation. Unlike Transformers that only use self-attention, Transformers with co-attention require to consider multiple attention maps in parallel in order to highlight the information that is relevant to the prediction in the model's input. In this work, we propose the first method to explain prediction by any Transformer-based architecture, including bi-modal Transformers and Transformers with co-attentions. We provide generic solutions and apply these to the three most commonly used of these architectures: (i) pure self-attention, (ii) self-attention combined with co-attention, and (iii) encoder-decoder attention.

However, vanilla Transformer architectures have not yielded promising improvements in the Knowledge Graph (KG) representations, where the translational distance paradigm dominates this area. Note that vanilla Transformer architectures struggle to capture the intrinsically heterogeneous structural and semantic information of knowledge graphs. To this end, we propose a new variant of Transformer for knowledge graph representations dubbed Relphormer. Specifically, we introduce Triple2Seq which can dynamically sample contextualized sub-graph sequences as the input to alleviate the heterogeneity issue. We propose a novel structure-enhanced self-attention mechanism to encode the relational information and keep the semantic information within entities and relations. Moreover, we utilize masked knowledge modeling for general knowledge graph representation learning, which can be applied to various KG-based tasks including knowledge graph completion, question answering, and recommendation. Experimental results on six datasets show that Relphormer can obtain better performance compared with baselines. Code is available in https://github.com/zjunlp/Relphormer."}

It projects knowledge graph embeddings in the homogeneous vector-space, introduces new token-types for entities, aligns entity position ids, and a selective attention mechanism. We take BERT as a baseline model and implement the \"Knowledge-Infused BERT\" by infusing knowledge context from ConceptNet and WordNet, which significantly outperforms BERT and other recent knowledge-aware BERT variants like ERNIE, SenseBERT, and BERT_CS over eight different subtasks of GLUE benchmark.

{"id": "47", "arxiv": "2305.06349v3", "title": "RECKONING: Reasoning through Dynamic Knowledge Encoding", "abstract": "Recent studies on transformer-based language models show that they can answer questions by reasoning over knowledge provided as part of the context (i.e., in-context reasoning). However, since the available knowledge is often not filtered for a particular question, in-context reasoning can be sensitive to distractor facts, additional content that is irrelevant to a question but that may be relevant for a different question (i.e., not necessarily random noise). In these situations, the model fails to distinguish the knowledge that is necessary to answer the question, leading to spurious reasoning and degraded performance. This reasoning failure contrasts with the model's apparent ability to distinguish its contextual knowledge from all the knowledge it has memorized during pre-training. Following this observation, we propose teaching the model to reason more robustly by folding the provided contextual knowledge into the model's parameters before presenting it with a question. Our method, RECKONING, is a bi-level learning algorithm that teaches language models to reason by updating their parametric knowledge through back-propagation, allowing them to then answer questions using the updated parameters. During training, the inner loop rapidly adapts a copy of the model weights to encode contextual knowledge into its parameters. In the outer loop, the model learns to use the updated weights to reproduce and answer reasoning questions about the memorized knowledge. Our experiments on two multi-hop reasoning datasets show that RECKONING's performance improves over the in-context reasoning baseline (by up to 4.5%). We also find that compared to in-context reasoning, RECKONING generalizes better to longer reasoning chains unseen during training, is more robust to distractors in the context, and is more computationally efficient when multiple questions are asked about the same knowledge."}

We propose DenseFormer, a simple modification to the standard architecture that improves the perplexity of the model without increasing its size -- adding a few thousand parameters for large-scale models in the 100B parameters range. Our approach relies on an additional averaging step after each transformer block, which computes a weighted average of current and past representations -- we refer to this operation as Depth-Weighted-Average (DWA). The learned DWA weights exhibit coherent patterns of information flow, revealing the strong and structured reuse of activations from distant layers. Experiments demonstrate that DenseFormer is more data efficient, reaching the same perplexity of much deeper transformer models, and that for the same perplexity, these new models outperform transformer baselines in terms of memory efficiency and inference time."}

In this work, we ask a different question: Can multimodal transformers leverage explicit knowledge in their reasoning? Existing, primarily unimodal, methods have explored approaches under the paradigm of knowledge retrieval followed by answer prediction, but leave open questions about the quality and relevance of the retrieved knowledge used, and how the reasoning processes over implicit and explicit knowledge should be integrated. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model - Knowledge Augmented Transformer (KAT) - which achieves a strong state-of-the-art result (+6 points absolute) on the open-domain multimodal task of OK-VQA. Our approach integrates implicit and explicit knowledge in an end to end encoder-decoder architecture, while still jointly reasoning over both knowledge sources during answer generation. An additional benefit of explicit knowledge integration is seen in improved interpretability of model predictions in our analysis."}

Recent studies, (e.g., (Bubeck et al., 2023)) on modern LLMs have shown that they are capable of performing amazing tasks typically necessitating human-level intelligence. However, unlike humans, frozen LLMs do not improve over time; they neither acquire new knowledge nor learn from their successes or failures. Some approaches to improving the intelligence of LLMs include fine-tuning models based on problem-solving performance (Zelikman et al., 2022), and building bigger and more sophisticated models (Bubeck et al., 2023). However, these methods have the drawback of requiring substantial data and computational resources to retrain existing models. In this paper, we explore the use of Retrieval Augmented Generation, also known as RAG (Lewis et al., 2021) to improve problem-solving performance. We propose ARM-RAG (Auxiliary Rationale Memory for Retrieval Augmented Generation), a system that learns from its successes without incurring high training costs.

However, their performance often lags behind conventional methods in standard tasks like retrieval. We attribute this to a mismatch between LLMs' knowledge and the knowledge crucial for effective recommendations. While LLMs excel at natural language reasoning, they cannot model complex user-item interactions inherent in recommendation tasks. We propose bridging the knowledge gap and equipping LLMs with recommendation-specific knowledge to address this. Operations such as Masked Item Modeling (MIM) and Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) have found success in conventional recommender systems. Inspired by this, we simulate these operations through natural language to generate auxiliary-task data samples that encode item correlations and user preferences. Fine-tuning LLMs on such auxiliary-task data samples and incorporating more informative recommendation-task data samples facilitates the injection of recommendation-specific knowledge into LLMs. Extensive experiments across retrieval, ranking, and rating prediction tasks on LLMs such as FLAN-T5-Base and FLAN-T5-XL show the effectiveness of our technique in domains such as Amazon Toys & Games, Beauty, and Sports & Outdoors.

While retrieval models have continued to improve with the introduction of increasingly complex architectures, few works have investigated a retrieval model's belief in the score beyond the scope of a single value. We argue that capturing the model's uncertainty with respect to its own scoring of a document is a critical aspect of retrieval that allows for greater use of current models across new document distributions, collections, or even improving effectiveness for down-stream tasks. In this paper, we address this problem via an efficient Bayesian framework for retrieval models which captures the model's belief in the relevance score through a stochastic process while adding only negligible computational overhead. We evaluate this belief via a ranking based calibration metric showing that our approximate Bayesian framework significantly improves a retrieval model's ranking effectiveness through a risk aware reranking as well as its confidence calibration. Lastly, we demonstrate that this additional uncertainty information is actionable and reliable on down-stream tasks represented via cutoff prediction."}

Although augmenting them with relevant external information can mitigate these issues, failure to consider the necessity of retrieval may adversely affect overall performance. Previous research has primarily focused on examining how entities influence retrieval models and knowledge recall in LMs, leaving other aspects relatively unexplored. In this work, our goal is to offer a more detailed, fact-centric analysis by exploring the effects of combinations of entities and relations. To facilitate this, we construct a new question answering (QA) dataset called WiTQA (Wikipedia Triple Question Answers). This dataset includes questions about entities and relations of various popularity levels, each accompanied by a supporting passage. Our extensive experiments with diverse LMs and retrievers reveal when retrieval does not consistently enhance LMs from the viewpoints of fact-centric popularity. Confirming earlier findings, we observe that larger LMs excel in recalling popular facts. However, they notably encounter difficulty with infrequent entity-relation pairs compared to retrievers.

The self-attention mechanism in the transformer architecture is capable of capturing long-range dependencies and it is the main reason behind its effectiveness in processing sequential data. Nevertheless, despite their success, transformers have two significant drawbacks that still limit their applicability in online reinforcement learning: (1) in order to remember all past information, the self-attention mechanism requires access to the whole history to be provided as context. (2) The inference cost in transformers is expensive. In this paper, we introduce recurrent alternatives to the transformer self-attention mechanism that offer context-independent inference cost, leverage long-range dependencies effectively, and performs well in online reinforcement learning task. We quantify the impact of the different components of our architecture in a diagnostic environment and assess performance gains in 2D and 3D pixel-based partially-observable environments (e.g. T-Maze, Mystery Path, Craftax, and Memory Maze).

It utilizes a number of feed-forward self-attention layers to replace the recurrent neural networks (RNN) in attention-based encoder decoder (AED) architecture. Self-attention layer learns temporal dependence by incorporating sinusoidal positional embedding of tokens in a sequence for parallel computing. Quicker iteration speed in training than sequential operation of RNN can be obtained. Deeper layers of the transformer also make it perform better than RNN-based AED. However, this parallelization ability is lost when applying scheduled sampling training. Self-attention with sinusoidal positional embedding may cause performance degradations for longer sequences that have similar acoustic or semantic information at different positions as well. To address these problems, we propose to use parallel scheduled sampling (PSS) and relative positional embedding (RPE) to help the transformer generalize to unseen data.

These limitations stem from the absence of implicit and missing context in the data alone. To address this, researchers have explored augmenting these models with external knowledge from knowledge graphs to provide the necessary additional context. However, the ad-hoc nature of existing methods makes it difficult to properly analyze the effects of knowledge infusion on the many moving parts or components of a transformer. This paper introduces a systematic method for infusing knowledge into different components of a transformer-based model. A modular framework is proposed to identify specific components within the transformer architecture, such as the self-attention mechanism, encoder layers, or the input embedding layer, where knowledge infusion can be applied. Additionally, extensive experiments are conducted on the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark tasks, and the findings are reported. This systematic approach aims to facilitate more principled approaches to incorporating knowledge into language model architectures."}

Importantly, they allow the creation of word embeddings that capture important semantic information about words in context. However, as single entities, these embeddings are difficult to interpret and the models used to create them have been described as opaque. Binder and colleagues proposed an intuitive embedding space where each dimension is based on one of 65 core semantic features. Unfortunately, the space only exists for a small dataset of 535 words, limiting its uses. Previous work (Utsumi, 2018, 2020, Turton, Vinson & Smith, 2020) has shown that Binder features can be derived from static embeddings and successfully extrapolated to a large new vocabulary. Taking the next step, this paper demonstrates that Binder features can be derived from the BERT embedding space. This provides contextualised Binder embeddings, which can aid in understanding semantic differences between words in context. It additionally provides insights into how semantic features are represented across the different layers of the BERT model."}

To tackle this challenge, we propose Edge Transformer, a new model that combines inspiration from Transformers and rule-based symbolic AI. The first key idea in Edge Transformers is to associate vector states with every edge, that is, with every pair of input nodes -- as opposed to just every node, as it is done in the Transformer model. The second major innovation is a triangular attention mechanism that updates edge representations in a way that is inspired by unification from logic programming. We evaluate Edge Transformer on compositional generalization benchmarks in relational reasoning, semantic parsing, and dependency parsing. In all three settings, the Edge Transformer outperforms Relation-aware, Universal and classical Transformer baselines."}

In this paper, we argue that context derived from a knowledge graph (in our case: Wikidata) provides enough signals to inform pretrained transformer models and improve their performance for named entity disambiguation (NED) on Wikidata KG. We further hypothesize that our proposed KG context can be standardized for Wikipedia, and we evaluate the impact of KG context on state-of-the-art NED model for the Wikipedia knowledge base. Our empirical results validate that the proposed KG context can be generalized (for Wikipedia), and providing KG context in transformer architectures considerably outperforms the existing baselines, including the vanilla transformer models."}

Our experiments show that increasing model size results in marginal gains on in-domain test sets, but much larger gains in new domains never seen during fine-tuning. Furthermore, we show that rerankers largely outperform dense ones of similar size in several tasks. Our largest reranker reaches the state of the art in 12 of the 18 datasets of the Benchmark-IR (BEIR) and surpasses the previous state of the art by 3 average points.

Efficient variational inference based approaches are used to estimate the latent parameter posterior distributions associated with different parts of the Transformer model architecture including multi-head self-attention, feed forward and embedding layers.

Recently, various efficient attention architectures have been proposed to improve transformer's efficiency while largely preserving its efficacy, especially in modeling long sequences. A widely-used benchmark to test these efficient methods' capability on long-range modeling is Long Range Arena (LRA). However, LRA only focuses on the standard bidirectional (or noncausal) self attention, and completely ignores cross attentions and unidirectional (or causal) attentions, which are equally important to downstream applications. In this paper, we propose Comprehensive Attention Benchmark (CAB) under a fine-grained attention taxonomy with four distinguishable attention patterns, namely, noncausal self, causal self, noncausal cross, and causal cross attentions. CAB collects seven real-world tasks from different research areas to evaluate efficient attentions under the four attention patterns. Among these tasks, CAB validates efficient attentions in eight backbone networks to show their generalization across neural architectures. We conduct exhaustive experiments to benchmark the performances of nine widely-used efficient attention architectures designed with different philosophies on CAB. Extensive experimental results also shed light on the fundamental problems of efficient attentions, such as efficiency length against vanilla attention, performance consistency across attention patterns, the benefit of attention mechanisms, and interpolation/extrapolation on long-context language modeling."}

Recently, there are a number of works have shown the effectiveness in utilizing the attention mechanism for AU detection, however, most of them are binding the region of interest (ROI) with features but rarely apply attention between features of each AU. On the other hand, the transformer, which utilizes a more efficient self-attention mechanism, has been widely used in natural language processing and computer vision tasks but is not fully explored in AU detection tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end Multi-Head Fused Transformer (MFT) method for AU detection, which learns AU encoding features representation from different modalities by transformer encoder and fuses modalities by another fusion transformer module. Multi-head fusion attention is designed in the fusion transformer module for the effective fusion of multiple modalities.

The superior performance of Transformer has been attributed to propagating signals over shorter distances, between positions in the input and the output, compared to the recurrent architectures. We establish connections between the dynamics in Transformer and recurrent networks to argue that several factors including gradient flow along an ensemble of multiple weakly dependent paths play a paramount role in the success of Transformer.

In this work, we study how effectively transformers can bridge between their pretraining data mixture, comprised of multiple distinct task families, to identify and learn new tasks in-context which are both inside and outside the pretraining distribution. Building on previous work, we investigate this question in a controlled setting, where we study transformer models trained on sequences of $(x, f(x))$ pairs rather than natural language. Our empirical results show transformers demonstrate near-optimal unsupervised model selection capabilities, in their ability to first in-context identify different task families and in-context learn within them when the task families are well-represented in their pretraining data. However when presented with tasks or functions which are out-of-domain of their pretraining data, we demonstrate various failure modes of transformers and degradation of their generalization for even simple extrapolation tasks. Together our results highlight that the impressive ICL abilities of high-capacity sequence models may be more closely tied to the coverage of their pretraining data mixtures than inductive biases that create fundamental generalization capabilities."}

However, in real practice, the examples are usually text input, and all words, regardless of their logic relationship, are stored in different tokens (i.e., unstructured data \\cite{wibisono2023role}). To understand how LLMs learn from the unstructured data in ICL, this paper studies the role of each component in the transformer architecture and provides a theoretical understanding to explain the success of the architecture. In particular, we consider a simple transformer with one/two attention layers and linear regression tasks for the ICL prediction. We observe that (1) a transformer with two layers of (self-)attentions with a look-ahead attention mask can learn from the prompt in the unstructured data, and (2) positional encoding can match the $x_i$ and $y_i$ tokens to achieve a better ICL performance."}

One common solution to this is augmenting LLMs with a retrieval system and making sure that the generated output is attributable to the retrieved information. Given this new added constraint, it is plausible to expect that the overall quality of the output will be affected, for example, in terms of fluency. Can scaling language models help? Here we examine the relationship between fluency and attribution in LLMs prompted with retrieved evidence in knowledge-heavy dialog settings. Our experiments were implemented with a set of auto-metrics that are aligned with human preferences. They were used to evaluate a large set of generations, produced under varying parameters of LLMs and supplied context. We show that larger models tend to do much better in both fluency and attribution, and that (naively) using top-k retrieval versus top-1 retrieval improves attribution but hurts fluency. We next propose a recipe that could allow smaller models to both close the gap with larger models and preserve the benefits of top-k retrieval while avoiding its drawbacks."}

We find that LMs struggle with less popular factual knowledge, and that scaling fails to appreciably improve memorization of factual knowledge in the long tail. We then show that retrieval-augmented LMs largely outperform orders of magnitude larger LMs, while unassisted LMs remain competitive in questions about high-popularity entities. Based on those findings, we devise a simple, yet effective, method for powerful and efficient retrieval-augmented LMs, which retrieves non-parametric memories only when necessary.

We propose a novel evaluation approach, eRAG, where each document in the retrieval list is individually utilized by the large language model within the RAG system. The output generated for each document is then evaluated based on the downstream task ground truth labels. In this manner, the downstream performance for each document serves as its relevance label. We employ various downstream task metrics to obtain document-level annotations and aggregate them using set-based or ranking metrics. Extensive experiments on a wide range of datasets demonstrate that eRAG achieves a higher correlation with downstream RAG performance compared to baseline methods, with improvements in Kendall's $τ$ correlation ranging from 0.168 to 0.494.

The introduction of bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) leads to a robust encoder for the transformer model that can understand the broader context and deliver state-of-the-art performance across various NLP tasks. This has inspired researchers and practitioners to apply BERT to practical problems, such as information retrieval (IR). A survey that focuses on a comprehensive analysis of prevalent approaches that apply pretrained transformer encoders like BERT to IR can thus be useful for academia and the industry. In light of this, we revisit a variety of BERT-based methods in this survey, cover a wide range of techniques of IR, and group them into six high-level categories: (i) handling long documents, (ii) integrating semantic information, (iii) balancing effectiveness and efficiency, (iv) predicting the weights of terms, (v) query expansion, and (vi) document expansion. We also provide links to resources, including datasets and toolkits, for BERT-based IR systems.

Focusing on the Llama-2 family of transformer models, our study uses carefully constructed non-English prompts with a unique correct single-token continuation. From layer to layer, transformers gradually map an input embedding of the final prompt token to an output embedding from which next-token probabilities are computed. Tracking intermediate embeddings through their high-dimensional space reveals three distinct phases, whereby intermediate embeddings (1) start far away from output token embeddings; (2) already allow for decoding a semantically correct next token in the middle layers, but give higher probability to its version in English than in the input language; (3) finally move into an input-language-specific region of the embedding space. We cast these results into a conceptual model where the three phases operate in \"input space\", \"concept space\", and \"output space\", respectively. Crucially, our evidence suggests that the abstract \"concept space\" lies closer to English than to other languages, which may have important consequences regarding the biases held by multilingual language models."}

We use PAPA to analyze several established pretrained Transformers on six downstream tasks. We find that without any input-dependent attention, all models achieve competitive performance -- an average relative drop of only 8% from the probing baseline. Further, little or no performance drop is observed when replacing half of the input-dependent attention matrices with constant (input-independent) ones. Interestingly, we show that better-performing models lose more from applying our method than weaker models, suggesting that the utilization of the input-dependent attention mechanism might be a factor in their success.

We propose effective attention as a complementary tool for improving explanatory interpretations based on attention. Furthermore, we show that input tokens retain to a large degree their identity across the model.

Transformer embedding models such as BERT capture shades of association and connotation that vary across the different linguistic contexts of any particular word or span of text. Here we report a procedure for encoding scientific documents with these tools, measuring their improvement over static word embeddings in a nearest-neighbor retrieval task.

The self-attention architecture allows transformer to combine information from all elements of a sequence into context-aware representations.

Adding trainable memory to selectively store local as well as global representations of a sequence is a promising direction to improve the Transformer model. Memory-augmented neural networks (MANNs) extend traditional neural architectures with general-purpose memory for representations. MANNs have demonstrated the capability to learn simple algorithms like Copy or Reverse and can be successfully trained via backpropagation on diverse tasks from question answering to language modeling outperforming RNNs and LSTMs of comparable complexity. In this work, we propose and study few extensions of the Transformer baseline (1) by adding memory tokens to store non-local representations, (2) creating memory bottleneck for the global information, (3) controlling memory update with dedicated layer. We evaluate these memory augmented Transformers and demonstrate that presence of memory positively correlates with the model performance for machine translation and language modelling tasks.

Their large receptive field endows Transformer models with higher representation power than their CNN counterparts. Nevertheless, simply enlarging the receptive field also raises several concerns. On the one hand, using dense attention in ViT leads to excessive memory and computational cost, and features can be influenced by irrelevant parts that are beyond the region of interests. On the other hand, the handcrafted attention adopted in PVT or Swin Transformer is data agnostic and may limit the ability to model long-range relations. To solve this dilemma, we propose a novel deformable multi-head attention module, where the positions of key and value pairs in self-attention are adaptively allocated in a data-dependent way. This flexible scheme enables the proposed deformable attention to dynamically focus on relevant regions while maintains the representation power of global attention. On this basis, we present Deformable Attention Transformer (DAT), a general vision backbone efficient and effective for visual recognition. We further build an enhanced version DAT++. Extensive experiments show that our DAT++ achieves state-of-the-art results on various visual recognition benchmarks, with 85.9% ImageNet accuracy, 54.5 and 47.0 MS-COCO instance segmentation mAP, and 51.5 ADE20K semantic segmentation mIoU."}

Current innovations, including State Space Models, were initially celebrated for surpassing Transformer performance on language modeling tasks. However, these models have revealed deficiencies in essential In-Context Learning capabilities - a domain where the Transformer traditionally shines. The Based model emerged as a hybrid solution, blending a Linear Transformer with a kernel inspired by the Taylor expansion of exponential functions, augmented by convolutional networks. Mirroring the Transformer's in-context adeptness, it became a strong contender in the field. In our work, we present a singular, elegant alteration to the Based kernel that amplifies its In-Context Learning abilities evaluated with the Multi-Query Associative Recall task and overall language modeling process, as demonstrated on the Pile dataset."}
{"id": "91", "arxiv": "2206.00826v1", "title": "BayesFormer: Transformer with Uncertainty Estimation", "abstract": "Transformer has become ubiquitous due to its dominant performance in various NLP and image processing tasks. However, it lacks understanding of how to generate mathematically grounded uncertainty estimates for transformer architectures. Models equipped with such uncertainty estimates can typically improve predictive performance, make networks robust, avoid over-fitting and used as acquisition function in active learning. In this paper, we introduce BayesFormer, a Transformer model with dropouts designed by Bayesian theory. We proposed a new theoretical framework to extend the approximate variational inference-based dropout to Transformer-based architectures. Through extensive experiments, we validate the proposed architecture in four paradigms and show improvements across the board: language modeling and classification, long-sequence understanding, machine translation and acquisition function for active learning."}

However, the vast number of parameters in these models has raised concerns regarding computational efficiency, environmental impact, and deployability on resource-limited platforms. To address these challenges, this paper investigates the application of weight pruning-a strategic reduction of model parameters based on their significance-as an optimization strategy for Transformer architectures. Through extensive experimentation, we explore various pruning methodologies, highlighting their impact on model performance, size, and computational demands. Our findings suggest that with judicious selection of pruning hyperparameters, significant reductions in model size are attainable without considerable compromise on performance. Moreover, when coupled with post-pruning fine-tuning strategies, some pruned models even exhibit enhanced generalization capabilities. This work seeks to bridge the gap between model efficiency and performance, paving the way for more scalable and environmentally responsible deep learning applications."}
{"id": "93", "arxiv": "2404.14462v2", "title": "Towards smaller, faster decoder-only transformers: Architectural variants and their implications", "abstract": "In recent times, the research on Large Language Models (LLMs) has grown exponentially, predominantly focusing on models underpinned by the transformer architecture, as established by [1], and further developed through the decoder-only variations by [2]. Contemporary efforts in this field primarily aim to enhance model capabilities by scaling up both the architecture and data volumes utilized during training. However, the exploration into reduce these model sizes while preserving their efficacy remains scant. In this study, we introduce three modifications to the decoder-only transformer architecture, namely ParallelGPT (pgpt), LinearGPT (lgpt), and ConvGPT (cgpt). These variants demonstrate comparable performance to the conventional architecture in language generation, yet benefit from reduced model sizes and faster training processes. We open-source the model weights and the complete codebase for these implementation for further research."}

However, mechanisms to explain its capabilities are not well understood. Focused on the training process, here we establish a meta-learning view of the Transformer architecture when trained for the causal language modeling task, by explicating an inner optimization process within the Transformer. Further, within the inner optimization, we discover and theoretically analyze a special characteristic of the norms of learned token representations within Transformer-based causal language models. Our analysis is supported by experiments in various settings."}
{"id": "95", "arxiv": "2402.08211v1", "title": "Transformer Mechanisms Mimic Frontostriatal Gating Operations When Trained on Human Working Memory Tasks", "abstract": "Models based on the Transformer neural network architecture have seen success on a wide variety of tasks that appear to require complex \"cognitive branching\" -- or the ability to maintain pursuit of one goal while accomplishing others. In cognitive neuroscience, success on such tasks is thought to rely on sophisticated frontostriatal mechanisms for selective \\textit{gating}, which enable role-addressable updating -- and later readout -- of information to and from distinct \"addresses\" of memory, in the form of clusters of neurons. However, Transformer models have no such mechanisms intentionally built-in. It is thus an open question how Transformers solve such tasks, and whether the mechanisms that emerge to help them to do so bear any resemblance to the gating mechanisms in the human brain. In this work, we analyze the mechanisms that emerge within a vanilla attention-only Transformer trained on a simple sequence modeling task inspired by a task explicitly designed to study working memory gating in computational cognitive neuroscience. We find that, as a result of training, the self-attention mechanism within the Transformer specializes in a way that mirrors the input and output gating mechanisms which were explicitly incorporated into earlier, more biologically-inspired architectures. These results suggest opportunities for future research on computational similarities between modern AI architectures and models of the human brain."}
{"id": "96", "arxiv": "2305.19129v1", "title": "Key-Value Transformer", "abstract": "Transformers have emerged as the prevailing standard solution for various AI tasks, including computer vision and natural language processing. The widely adopted Query, Key, and Value formulation (QKV) has played a significant role in this. Nevertheless, no research has examined the essentiality of these three components for transformer performance. Therefore, we conducted an evaluation of the key-value formulation (KV), which generates symmetric attention maps, along with an asymmetric version that incorporates a 2D positional encoding into the attention matrix. Remarkably, this transformer requires fewer parameters and computation than the original one. Through experiments encompassing three task types -- synthetics (such as reversing or sorting a list), vision (mnist or cifar classification), and NLP (character generation and translation) -- we discovered that the KV transformer occasionally outperforms the QKV transformer. However, it also exhibits instances of underperformance compared to QKV, making it challenging to draw a definitive conclusion. Nonetheless, we consider the reported results to be encouraging and anticipate that they may pave the way for more efficient transformers in the future."}
{"id": "97", "arxiv": "2310.04990v1", "title": "Waveformer for modelling dynamical systems", "abstract": "Neural operators have gained recognition as potent tools for learning solutions of a family of partial differential equations. The state-of-the-art neural operators excel at approximating the functional relationship between input functions and the solution space, potentially reducing computational costs and enabling real-time applications. However, they often fall short when tackling time-dependent problems, particularly in delivering accurate long-term predictions. In this work, we propose \"waveformer\", a novel operator learning approach for learning solutions of dynamical systems. The proposed waveformer exploits wavelet transform to capture the spatial multi-scale behavior of the solution field and transformers for capturing the long horizon dynamics. We present four numerical examples involving Burgers's equation, KS-equation, Allen Cahn equation, and Navier Stokes equation to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach. Results obtained indicate the capability of the proposed waveformer in learning the solution operator and show that the proposed Waveformer can learn the solution operator with high accuracy, outperforming existing state-of-the-art operator learning algorithms by up to an order, with its advantage particularly visible in the extrapolation region"}
{"id": "98", "arxiv": "2210.00640v2", "title": "Wide Attention Is The Way Forward For Transformers?", "abstract": "The Transformer is an extremely powerful and prominent deep learning architecture. In this work, we challenge the commonly held belief in deep learning that going deeper is better, and show an alternative design approach that is building wider attention Transformers. We demonstrate that wide single layer Transformer models can compete with or outperform deeper ones in a variety of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks when both are trained from scratch. The impact of changing the model aspect ratio on Transformers is then studied systematically. This ratio balances the number of layers and the number of attention heads per layer while keeping the total number of attention heads and all other hyperparameters constant. On average, across 4 NLP tasks and 10 attention types, single layer wide models perform 0.3% better than their deep counterparts. We show an in-depth evaluation and demonstrate how wide models require a far smaller memory footprint and can run faster on commodity hardware, in addition, these wider models are also more interpretable. For example, a single layer Transformer on the IMDb byte level text classification has 3.1x faster inference latency on a CPU than its equally accurate deeper counterpart, and is half the size. We therefore put forward wider and shallower models as a viable and desirable alternative for small models on NLP tasks, and as an important area of research for domains beyond this."}
{"id": "99", "arxiv": "2312.05361v1", "title": "Emergence and Function of Abstract Representations in Self-Supervised Transformers", "abstract": "Human intelligence relies in part on our brains' ability to create abstract mental models that succinctly capture the hidden blueprint of our reality. Such abstract world models notably allow us to rapidly navigate novel situations by generalizing prior knowledge, a trait deep learning systems have historically struggled to replicate. However, the recent shift from supervised to self-supervised objectives, combined with expressive transformer-based architectures, have yielded powerful foundation models that appear to learn versatile representations that can support a wide range of downstream tasks. This promising development raises the intriguing possibility of such models developing in silico abstract world models. We test this hypothesis by studying the inner workings of small-scale transformers trained to reconstruct partially masked visual scenes generated from a simple blueprint. We show that the network develops intermediate abstract representations, or abstractions, that encode all semantic features of the dataset. These abstractions manifest as low-dimensional manifolds where the embeddings of semantically related tokens transiently converge, thus allowing for the generalization of downstream computations. Using precise manipulation experiments, we demonstrate that abstractions are central to the network's decision-making process. Our research also suggests that these abstractions are compositionally structured, exhibiting features like contextual independence and part-whole relationships that mirror the compositional nature of the dataset. Finally, we introduce a Language-Enhanced Architecture (LEA) designed to encourage the network to articulate its computations. We find that LEA develops an abstraction-centric language that can be easily interpreted, allowing us to more readily access and steer the network's decision-making process."}
{"id": "100", "arxiv": "2403.09635v1", "title": "Transformers Get Stable: An End-to-End Signal Propagation Theory for Language Models", "abstract": "In spite of their huge success, transformer models remain difficult to scale in depth. In this work, we develop a unified signal propagation theory and provide formulae that govern the moments of the forward and backward signal through the transformer model. Our framework can be used to understand and mitigate vanishing/exploding gradients, rank collapse, and instability associated with high attention scores. We also propose DeepScaleLM, an initialization and scaling scheme that conserves unit output/gradient moments throughout the model, enabling the training of very deep models with 1000 layers. We find that transformer models could be much deeper - our deep models with fewer parameters outperform shallow models in Language Modeling, Speech Translation, and Image Classification, across encoder-only, decoder-only and encoder-decoder variants, for both Pre-LN and Post-LN transformers, for multiple datasets and model sizes. These improvements also translate into improved performance on downstream Question Answering tasks and improved robustness for Image Classification."}
