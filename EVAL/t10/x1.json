Enhancing LLMs’ understanding of their factual knowledge boundaries through retrieval augmentation can improve their performance in open-domain question answering and ensure the reliability and relevance of information services [17,9]. By improving the interpretability of retrieval processes and employing computationally efficient methodologies, the development of equitable and ethically sound information retrieval systems can be achieved. Domain Adaptation and Generalization Domain adaptation and generalization are critical challenges in deploying LLMs for information retrieval, requiring innovative strategies to enhance model adaptability across diverse domains and tasks. Future research should prioritize optimizing retrieval strategies to improve the efficiency of active retrieval methods, as suggested by [5], which is essential for refining retrieval mechanisms and enhancing generalization across applications. Further exploration into optimizing reasoning models for specific retrieval tasks and developing efficient methodologies to enhance scalability presents promising avenues for improving domain adaptation [28]. Advancements in emotional recognition systems and the societal implications of widespread chatbot usage could significantly contribute to domain adaptation efforts [6]. Implementing strategies that leverage the synergy between Information Retrieval (IR) models and LLMs can lead to the development of robust and adaptable information retrieval systems. These systems will effectively address the diverse and evolving needs of user populations across various domains. LLMs enhance IR by facilitating generative retrieval, improving user understanding, and optimizing user-system interactions, while slim proxy models like SlimPLM identify missing knowledge to streamline retrieval processes and reduce computational costs. Initiatives like ALCE and KELLER focus on improving citation accuracy and integrating domain-specific expertise, further refining LLM capabilities in generating reliable and contextually relevant information. These advancements ensure that LLMs serve as powerful tools for information seeking while maintaining credibility and ethical standards in their applications [42,8,31,9]. Integration of External Knowledge and Reasoning Integrating external knowledge and reasoning into information retrieval systems is crucial for enhancing the capabilities of LLMs. RoleRAG exemplifies this by optimizing task-specific role tokens, facilitating streamlined processing and reduced resource consumption in retrieval tasks [62]. This approach underscores the necessity of optimizing role-based processing to effectively accommodate diverse data sources. Innovative pipelines like Tool-Star introduce a general tool-integrated reasoning data synthesis mechanism alongside a two-stage training framework, collectively improving the collaborative reasoning capabilities of large language models [70]. This innovation highlights the importance of robust frameworks for synthesizing data and facilitating seamless interaction with external tools, thereby enhancing reasoning processes. Models like START, which successfully integrate external tools through self-learning techniques, demonstrate significant improvements in reasoning processes, emphasizing the importance of continuous learning and adaptation in retrieval systems [60]. Additionally, ARPO's strategy of dynamically adapting exploration based on uncertainty allows LLMs to internalize the benefits of tool interactions, refining retrieval outcomes and enhancing model adaptability [57]. Future research should focus on optimizing the integration of various external search systems, as illustrated by the R1-Searcher framework, which proposes broader applications across different domains [71]. Expanding benchmarks, as discussed in Webwatcher, with real-world data and increased task coverage is another potential area for enhancing the robustness and applicability of retrieval systems [72]. Collectively, these advancements indicate that integrating external knowledge and reasoning frameworks is instrumental in advancing information retrieval systems, enabling them to handle complex queries with improved accuracy and contextual awareness. Future efforts should prioritize optimization techniques and explore new methodologies for seamlessly integrating these components into LLM-based retrieval systems, addressing emerging trends and user interaction demands [9]. Conclusion The survey underscores the profound influence of Large Language Models (LLMs) on the evolution of information retrieval systems, particularly in advancing semantic search capabilities and addressing the shortcomings of conventional approaches. Notable findings reveal that query expansions facilitated by LLMs, especially through CoT prompts, substantially boost retrieval accuracy and efficiency, with WebAgent experiments showcasing over 50 Innovative approaches such as Rethinking with Retrieval (RR) have significantly elevated LLM performance across diverse reasoning tasks, indicating promising directions for future retrieval system advancements. The domain-specific proficiency of BloombergGPT highlights LLM adaptability in specialized sectors, notably financial technology. Additionally, QLoRA's effective finetuning on compact, high-quality datasets has achieved state-of-the-art outcomes, underscoring the potential for progress in information retrieval and semantic search. The efficacy of SimpleDeepSearcher in refining deep search systems accentuates the critical role of strategic data engineering in optimizing retrieval processes. BART's pretraining methodology has reached state-of-the-art standards in text generation and comprehension, emphasizing the importance of sophisticated pretraining techniques in enhancing LLM functionalities. This survey demonstrates the crucial role of LLMs in transforming information retrieval systems, offering robust frameworks for semantic search and personalized user engagement. As research advances, these models are anticipated to expand the scope of retrieval tasks across various fields, addressing existing inefficiencies and promoting more effective integration of web-based information. The findings highlight the necessity for continued investigation and refinement of LLM-based strategies to meet the evolving needs of users in a complex informational environment.",
