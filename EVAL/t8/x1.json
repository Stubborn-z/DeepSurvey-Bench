Finally, the survey outlines future research directions, proposing innovative techniques for bias mitigation, practical applications, and considerations for marginalized language users.The following sections are organized as shown in . Background and Definitions Overview of Large Language Models Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a transformative advancement in Natural Language Processing (NLP), capable of generating human-like text for diverse tasks such as translation, classification, and content creation [2]. These models leverage deep neural networks to achieve broad applicability across domains, yet they face challenges related to data quality and consistency, as critiqued by the NeuroLogic framework [3]. BART, a denoising autoencoder, exemplifies improvements in sequence-to-sequence models by reconstructing corrupted inputs [4]. The GEM benchmark highlights difficulties in evaluating natural language generation, pointing out limitations and biases in current metrics and datasets [5], while the SQuAD benchmark emphasizes the need for comprehensive reading comprehension datasets to enhance model capabilities [6]. Disentangled representations are pivotal for tasks like fair classification and style transfer, underscoring LLMs' diverse applications [7]. Despite their strengths, LLMs struggle with complex reasoning tasks [8], and their deployment is hindered by storage and computational demands [9]. Magnitude pruning is less effective in reducing model size within the transfer learning context [10]. The Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus (C4) illustrates the varied textual sources used in LLM training, including unconventional ones like patents and military websites [11]. Innovative strategies such as prompt tuning enhance task-specific performance by learning tailored soft prompts [12]. XLM-R has improved cross-lingual performance, especially for low-resource languages, marking progress in multilingual capabilities [13]. Fine-tuning approaches, including InstructGPT, use human feedback to align model outputs with user instructions more effectively [14]. AdapterFusion optimizes transfer learning by integrating task-specific parameters through a two-stage learning algorithm [15]. Definitions of Bias and Fairness Bias in large language models (LLMs) is a significant issue, manifesting as systematic disparities that lead to unequal treatment across demographic groups. These biases often originate from training datasets, which neural models learn and replicate, potentially causing representational harms and reinforcing stereotypes [16]. The challenge of rewriting text to be gender-neutral remains, highlighting the need for inclusivity in language processing [17]. Bias quantification in LLMs involves methodologies such as prompting datasets, metrics, and sampling strategies [18]. Gender bias is notable in pre-trained models, affecting gender-neutral professions and perpetuating stereotypes [19]. Predicted probability distributions can reflect societal biases, distorting nationality representations and affecting content fairness [20]. Fairness in AI seeks equitable treatment across demographic groups, free from biased norms or stereotypes [21]. Many fairness frameworks overlook the socially constructed nature of race, minimizing structural algorithmic unfairness [22]. Defining sensitive attributes like gender and race complicates fairness efforts [23]. Data diversity and accuracy during text generation significantly impact AI bias and fairness [24]. Comprehensive measurement tools are essential for capturing bias and fairness effectively [21]. A proposed fairness taxonomy offers a framework for counteracting AI system bias [22]. Bias-measuring datasets are crucial for identifying biased behavior in language models and assessing mitigation methods [21]. Natural Language Processing and Transfer Learning Natural Language Processing (NLP) is crucial for large language models (LLMs), enabling them to understand and generate human-like text across applications. Transfer learning is key in NLP, allowing pre-trained models to adapt to specific tasks, enhancing performance and efficiency. The BOLD dataset illustrates the diversity of prompts used to evaluate biases in domains like profession, gender, race, religion, and political ideology, emphasizing comprehensive evaluation frameworks in NLP [25]. Transfer learning methods, such as diff pruning, offer parameter-efficient solutions by learning task-specific diff vectors that extend pre-trained parameters, adaptively pruned during training to optimize resources [26]. The HELM benchmark promotes language model transparency by addressing evaluation gaps and encouraging holistic assessments [27]. The SQuAD dataset challenges models with questions tied to specific text segments, advancing NLP reading comprehension capabilities [6]. Movement pruning exemplifies the adaptation of pre-trained models during fine-tuning, facilitating efficient model deployment [10]. NLP continues to face bias mitigation challenges, especially in texts aiming for objectivity. The need for benchmarks to neutralize inappropriate subjectivity underscores ongoing efforts to enhance fairness and accuracy in language processing [28]. Transfer learning is evolving, providing innovative approaches to optimize LLM performance while considering ethical and societal implications. Algorithmic Bias in Large Language Models Algorithmic bias in large language models (LLMs) arises primarily from training data and architectural frameworks. Training datasets, often sourced from extensive internet corpora, inherently reflect societal biases, including entrenched gender stereotypes, which LLMs replicate [29]. These biases are evident in the portrayal of marginalized groups, such as queer individuals, perpetuating harmful stereotypes [30]. Additionally, biased portrayals in narrative datasets underscore the need for algorithms designed for bias correction [31]. The challenge is compounded by LLMs’ frequent failure to meet user expectations, often reinforcing societal stereotypes. The architectural design of LLMs significantly influences bias propagation. Debiasing methods that modify all parameters of pre-trained language models (PLMs) are computationally demanding and risk losing valuable linguistic knowledge [32]. These methods often treat detoxifying and debiasing as distinct issues, neglecting the complex interplay of biases in language generation outputs [21]. Structured prediction models exacerbate this issue by amplifying gender biases in training datasets, leading to persistent bias amplification across probability distributions [19]. Existing evaluation benchmarks, such as GLUE and SuperGLUE, fail to account for dialectal variations, resulting in inadequate model performance on non-standard dialects, highlighting algorithmic bias sources [33]. This gap underscores the necessity for robust strategies to identify and mitigate biases at various levels of language representation [24]. Catastrophic forgetting during second-phase pre-training further complicates bias mitigation, as models lose critical information from original training data, degrading overall performance. Addressing entrenched social biases in training data requires innovative approaches to ensure equitable AI systems. Comprehensive measurement tools are essential to capture and address stereotypes embedded in word and sentence representations. Additionally, variability in results based on prompt choices, metrics, and tools complicates the understanding of biases in language models, necessitating standardized evaluation frameworks [18]. Sources of Algorithmic Bias Algorithmic bias in LLMs originates mainly from training data and model architecture. Training datasets, often compiled from extensive internet sources, inherently carry societal biases, including entrenched gender stereotypes that LLMs learn and replicate [29]. This bias is evident in the portrayal of marginalized groups, such as queer individuals, where stereotypical representations are perpetuated [30]. Biased character portrayals in narrative datasets necessitate algorithms specifically aimed at bias correction [31]. The challenges are exacerbated by LLMs' inability to generate outputs aligning with user expectations, often reinforcing societal stereotypes. As illustrated in , the primary sources of algorithmic bias in large language models can be categorized into biases originating from training data, model architecture, and evaluation benchmarks. Each category highlights specific issues, such as gender stereotypes, challenges in detoxifying model outputs, and the impact of dialectal variations on model performance. LLM architecture significantly contributes to bias propagation. Debiasing methods involving the modification of all PLM parameters are computationally intensive and risk losing valuable language knowledge [32]. These methods often treat detoxifying and debiasing as separate challenges, neglecting the complexities of bias in language generation outputs [21]. Structured prediction models exacerbate the issue by amplifying gender biases in training datasets, leading to persistent bias amplification across probability distributions [19]. Existing benchmarks like GLUE and SuperGLUE do not account for dialectal variations, resulting in poor model performance on non-standard dialects, highlighting sources of algorithmic bias [33]. This gap underscores the need for robust strategies to identify and mitigate biases at multiple levels of language representation [24]. Catastrophic forgetting during second-phase pre-training complicates bias mitigation, as models lose important information from original training data, degrading performance. Entrenched social biases within training data necessitate innovative approaches to ensure equitable AI systems. Comprehensive measurement tools are crucial for capturing and addressing stereotypes embedded in word and sentence representations. Variability in results based on prompt choices, metrics, and tools complicates understanding biases in language models, necessitating standardized evaluation frameworks [18]. Manifestations of Bias in NLP Tasks Bias in NLP tasks manifests in various forms, impacting the fairness and efficacy of language model outputs. Gender bias is notably prevalent, as demonstrated in conversational NLP tasks where models trained on biased datasets produce unbalanced representations [29]. This issue extends to storytelling, where female characters are often depicted as passive compared to their male counterparts [31]. Visual recognition tasks reveal skewed interpretations of gender roles due to training on biased datasets, highlighting the pervasive nature of bias across NLP applications [34]. Sentiment bias is another critical concern, with models exhibiting statistically significant biases by providing higher sentiment predictions for certain races and genders [35]. This bias is evident in text generation models like GPT-2, which may amplify societal biases based on nationality, affecting the neutrality and fairness of generated content [20]. Dialectal features introduced in NLU models result in a performance drop, illustrating challenges in addressing bias in diverse linguistic contexts [33]. Efforts to mitigate bias in NLP tasks include debiasing techniques such as FairFil, which effectively debias sentence-level outputs while preserving semantic information [22]. The GEnder Equality Prompt (GEEP) offers advantages in enhancing gender fairness without the detrimental effects of catastrophic forgetting [23]. These manifestations of bias underscore the necessity for ongoing research and innovative approaches to enhance fairness and accuracy in NLP tasks, ensuring equitable treatment across diverse applications. Impact on Model Performance Bias significantly impacts the performance and reliability of LLMs, influencing their ability to produce equitable and accurate outputs. The ADELE framework exemplifies advancements in debiasing PLMs without risking catastrophic forgetting, maintaining the original model's knowledge integrity [32]. Such approaches are crucial for preserving LLMs' foundational capabilities while addressing embedded biases. The Unified Detoxifying and Debiasing Inference-time Adaptive Optimization (UDDIA) framework demonstrates superior performance, maintaining generation quality and efficiency [21]. The proposed filtering method effectively reduces gender bias in language models without significantly affecting their capabilities [19]. This balance ensures debiasing efforts do not deteriorate model performance, a central challenge in bias mitigation. Disparities in outputs, observed in experiments with ChatGPT, underscore ongoing bias issues, necessitating robust evaluation and intervention strategies [24]. AdapterFusion showcases the advantages of retaining knowledge from multiple tasks without interference, improving performance across diverse applications [15]. This capability enhances LLM adaptability and reliability, ensuring effective performance across different contexts without perpetuating biases. Comparative analysis of prompting strategies and metrics reveals significant variations in bias results, indicating a lack of consensus and underscoring the need for standardized evaluation frameworks [18]. These findings emphasize the critical need for continued research and development in bias mitigation techniques to improve LLM reliability and fairness. The ongoing challenge in AI development involves navigating the trade-off between reducing bias and maintaining model performance. This requires innovative strategies that integrate fairness theory with practical model selection, addressing systemic fairness research issues. As AI systems are increasingly used in sensitive environments, ensuring decisions do not reflect discriminatory behavior is crucial. Researchers are exploring debiasing algorithms that manage sensitive information fairly, ensuring minimal but necessary use for predictions while penalizing excessive reliance on such information. This balance is essential for creating equitable AI systems capable of making important decisions without compromising accuracy [36,37,38]. The examination of ethical considerations in artificial intelligence (AI) is crucial for the development of responsible technologies. A comprehensive understanding of these ethical implications necessitates a framework that encompasses various dimensions, including guidelines and strategies for implementation. illustrates the hierarchical structure of these ethical considerations, focusing on the interrelated aspects of ethical implications, guidelines, frameworks, and the importance of intersectionality and inclusivity. This figure highlights not only the challenges faced within each category but also the strategies that can be employed to address them, thereby underscoring the imperative for equitable AI systems and comprehensive ethical standards. Ethical Considerations in AI Ethical Implications in AI Biased AI systems pose significant ethical concerns, affecting fairness and societal outcomes across various applications. In NLP, addressing biases is crucial as they can reinforce gender stereotypes and hinder inclusivity [29]. Dialogue systems particularly require equitable decision-making to ensure user engagement and satisfaction [39]. Gender bias in visual recognition tasks further underscores the societal impact of biased AI systems [34]. Language models generating biased job advertisements exacerbate job market inequalities, highlighting broader societal implications. Additionally, inadequate representation of queer identities in AI outputs calls for enhanced inclusivity [30]. NLU models' struggles with dialectal understanding present ethical dilemmas, emphasizing the importance of fairness [33]. To visualize these critical issues, illustrates the ethical implications in AI by categorizing key areas such as bias in AI systems, inclusivity and representation, and ethical evaluation frameworks. Each category is supported by relevant research papers, highlighting the need for fairness, inclusivity, and responsible AI development. Frameworks like TrustGPT are vital for evaluating the ethical performance of LLMs, advocating responsible AI development [40]. The PALMS approach effectively guides models towards outputs that reflect cultural and ethical values [41]. A unified strategy for detoxifying and debiasing is essential to mitigate harmful content and ensure ethical practices [21]. Addressing these implications requires robust strategies to mitigate bias and promote fairness, ensuring responsible deployment and societal inclusivity [24]. Establishing Ethical Guidelines and Frameworks Ethical guidelines and frameworks are crucial for governing AI development to ensure fairness and reliability. Integrating fairness-oriented concepts of construct reliability and validity from diverse disciplines enhances the robustness of ethical frameworks [42]. Practical recommendations for dataset developers emphasize considering annotator identities to address biases in data collection and annotation [43]. Implementing these guidelines promotes responsible AI development, prioritizing fairness and inclusivity. As AI systems increasingly influence societal structures, comprehensive ethical guidelines are essential to mitigate biases that lead to discriminatory outcomes. These guidelines ensure equitable AI technologies across demographic groups, especially in sensitive environments where pivotal decisions are made. Recent research identifies biases in AI applications like sentiment analysis and dialogue systems, reflecting inappropriate human biases related to race and gender. Efforts to standardize fairness research in machine learning and NLP focus on developing benchmark datasets and debiasing methods to counteract these biases, highlighting the need for a unified approach to fairness definitions and model selection [35,37,36,44]. Intersectionality and Inclusivity in AI Intersectionality and inclusivity are critical for ensuring equitable AI systems across diverse demographic groups. Current studies often overlook cultural variability and moral judgments across different populations [45]. This limitation highlights the need for AI models to incorporate a broader understanding of cultural diversity and intersectional identities. Categorizing existing research by the explicitness of gender theorization reveals a gap in integrating intersectionality within AI frameworks [46]. Many models lack depth in capturing the multifaceted nature of identity, encompassing gender, race, ethnicity, and socio-economic status. Addressing this gap is crucial for developing genuinely inclusive AI systems that mitigate biases affecting marginalized communities. Enhancing intersectionality and inclusivity involves refining algorithms, data collection processes, and adopting ethical guidelines that prioritize diverse perspectives. By embracing intersectionality, AI systems can better represent social identities' complex interplay, leading to more accurate and fair outcomes. These efforts are essential for advancing AI technologies that equitably serve all individuals, respecting human diversity's rich tapestry. Challenges in Natural Language Processing In the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP), various challenges arise that significantly impact the effectiveness and fairness of language models. One of the most pressing issues is the presence of societal and cultural biases, which can be inadvertently encoded in the training data and subsequently reflected in the outputs of these models. As large-scale pretrained language models are increasingly integrated into sensitive real-world applications like healthcare, legal systems, and social sciences, understanding the social biases they may propagate becomes crucial for ensuring equitable outcomes. These biases, which can manifest as harmful stereotypes related to gender, race, religion, and other social constructs, risk amplifying negative generalizations and perpetuating systemic inequalities. To address these challenges, researchers have developed new benchmarks and metrics to measure representational biases and proposed methods to mitigate them during text generation. Effective techniques, such as regularization loss terms, have been shown to reduce gender bias in language models, although they require careful calibration to maintain model stability. Furthermore, assessing biases at the contextual word level, as demonstrated with models like BERT and GPT-2, provides insights into intersectional biases that are often overlooked in sentence-level analyses. By standardizing evaluation methods and aligning debiasing algorithms with fairness theory, the field aims to balance the trade-off between fairness and accuracy, thereby advancing the performance-fairness Pareto frontier and fostering more equitable language model outcomes. [36,47,48,49,50]. This leads us to examine the first critical aspect of this issue: the interplay between societal and cultural biases and their implications for language model development. Societal and Cultural Biases Societal and Cultural Biases Societal and cultural biases present significant challenges in the development and deployment of language models, as they are often reflected and perpetuated within the outputs of these systems. The complexity and variability of social norms across different cultures make it difficult to create a unified model that accurately represents diverse contexts [45]. This challenge is compounded by the historical and social contexts that influence dataset creation, which are frequently overlooked, leading to an incomplete understanding of their impact [51]. Research has highlighted the presence of societal biases in languages such as Hindi, contributing to the understanding of language representation in non-Western contexts [52]. However, existing studies often fail to adequately address the negative consequences of detoxification techniques on marginalized language users, resulting in a loss of utility and effectiveness [53]. This underscores the necessity for benchmarks that emphasize inclusive language in technology applications, ensuring that diverse user groups are represented fairly [54]. The survey of social disparities in India, including biases based on region and religion, further illustrates the pervasive nature of societal biases [55]. Additionally, unanswered questions remain regarding the full impact of individual and collective identities on dataset quality and the ethical responsibilities of dataset developers [43]. The BBQ dataset focuses on real-world social biases relevant to U.S. English-speaking contexts, highlighting biases against protected classes across nine social dimensions [56]. These findings underscore the urgent need for comprehensive evaluation frameworks that can effectively capture and address societal and cultural biases, particularly in the context of machine learning systems. Such frameworks should incorporate benchmark datasets like the Equity Evaluation Corpus (EEC) to assess biases in sentiment analysis systems, utilize novel approaches to evaluate biases at the contextual word level in models like BERT and GPT-2, and employ extrinsic bias metrics to measure the impact of gender bias on model performance. Additionally, it is crucial to decouple datasets and metrics to ensure reliable conclusions and consider the composition of datasets and choice of metrics for accurate bias measurement. [49,35,57]. By acknowledging and analyzing the historical and social contexts that shape dataset creation, developers can better understand and mitigate the biases embedded within language models, promoting fairness and inclusivity in AI systems. Language Nuances and Contextual Challenges The intricacies of language, encompassing its nuances and contextual dependencies, pose significant challenges in mitigating bias within Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems. Language models often struggle to accurately interpret and generate text that reflects the subtleties of human communication, leading to biased outputs that fail to account for the diversity of linguistic expressions. The complexity of language is evident in the varying interpretations of the same text across different cultural and social contexts, which can result in unintended biases when models are trained on datasets lacking representational diversity [45]. As illustrated in , the primary challenges in language processing are highlighted, focusing on the complexity and contextual dependencies of language alongside strategies for bias mitigation. The hierarchical structure of the figure emphasizes key aspects such as interpretation issues, cultural diversity, idiomatic expressions, and challenges related to sarcasm. This visual representation complements the discussion by providing a framework through which these challenges can be understood. The contextual nature of language further complicates bias mitigation efforts, as models must navigate the intricacies of meaning that change based on situational factors. This challenge is particularly pronounced in tasks that require a deep understanding of idiomatic expressions, sarcasm, and other forms of non-literal language, which are often underrepresented in training datasets [51]. The failure to capture these nuances can lead to models that reinforce stereotypes and propagate societal biases, as they lack the sophistication to differentiate between contextually appropriate and inappropriate language use. Efforts to address these challenges must focus on developing robust evaluation frameworks that account for the dynamic nature of language and its contextual dependencies. This involves creating diverse and inclusive datasets that reflect the full spectrum of linguistic expressions and cultural contexts. Additionally, innovative approaches to model training and evaluation are necessary to enhance the ability of language models to understand and generate nuanced text, thereby reducing bias and promoting fairness in NLP applications [54]. By acknowledging and addressing the complexities of language, researchers and developers can work towards creating more equitable and accurate AI systems that respect the diversity of human communication. Bias in Subjective Tasks and Social Norms Bias in subjective Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks presents significant challenges, as these tasks often involve interpreting nuanced human communication that is deeply embedded in social norms. Existing methods struggle to capture and leverage the valuable information inherent in disagreements among annotators, which is crucial for understanding the diverse perspectives reflected in subjective tasks [58]. This failure to effectively utilize annotator insights can lead to biased interpretations and reinforce prevailing social norms, thus impacting the fairness and accuracy of language model outputs. The reinforcement of social norms in NLP tasks is further complicated by the lack of nuanced understanding of annotator perspectives, which can perpetuate biases in model training and evaluation. Addressing this issue requires methodologies that provide a comprehensive analysis of annotator viewpoints, thereby mitigating bias in subjective tasks [59]. By incorporating diverse perspectives and acknowledging the complexity of social norms, researchers can develop more equitable NLP systems that accurately reflect the diversity of human communication. Efforts to mitigate bias in subjective tasks must prioritize enhancing the interpretative capabilities of language models to ensure they can adeptly navigate the complexities of social norms and subjective language use. This involves addressing representational biases that manifest through stereotypes related to gender, race, religion, and other social constructs, which can be harmful in sensitive decision-making contexts like healthcare and legal systems. Strategies include defining sources of bias, developing benchmarks and metrics for measurement, and implementing algorithms that neutralize subjective bias by transforming biased text into a neutral point of view. Additionally, counterfactual evaluations can be used to quantify and reduce sentiment bias, ensuring that sensitive attributes do not unduly influence the sentiment of generated text. Furthermore, debiasing approaches should aim for a balanced trade-off between task performance and bias mitigation, using sensitive information fairly and minimally necessary for accurate predictions. Empirical results and large-scale human evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches in improving fairness while maintaining high-fidelity text generation. [28,60,38,48]. This involves creating inclusive datasets that capture the full range of human expressions and developing innovative evaluation frameworks that account for the dynamic nature of subjective tasks. By addressing these challenges, researchers can work towards creating more fair and unbiased AI systems that respect the intricacies of human communication and social norms.

Despite these advancements, challenges such as scalability, computational demands, and integration with existing models persist. The systematic evaluation of group and individual fairness metrics in LLMs offers insights into model performance and highlights the need for robust evaluation frameworks [24]. Leveraging human feedback to guide model outputs ensures alignment with user intent [14]. The VALUE benchmark contributes lexical and morphosyntactic transformation rules for AAVE, aiding bias mitigation techniques [33]. GEEP freezes the pre-trained model while learning gender-related prompts from gender-neutral data, improving fairness while minimizing forgetting [23]. AdapterFusion proposes a two-stage learning algorithm to exploit learned representations without destructive interference [15]. The Gender-equalizing loss function (GELF) modifies the loss function to equalize output probabilities of male and female words [16]. A dual approach combining rule-based techniques and neural networks enhances performance [17]. A framework categorizing the impact of experimental choices on bias measurement outcomes emphasizes the need for standardized approaches [18]. Developing methods that balance fairness, model performance, and generalizability is crucial. Establishing comprehensive benchmarks and adopting innovative approaches to address diverse definitions and quantifications of bias will facilitate fair model selection and leverage datasets like the Equity Evaluation Corpus to systematically evaluate and reduce race and gender biases across various machine learning applications [36,37,35]. Data Augmentation and Substitution Methods Data augmentation and substitution methods are vital for mitigating bias in large language models (LLMs), offering strategies to enhance fairness and accuracy. Techniques like Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA) and Counterfactual Data Substitution (CDS) transform sentences into counterfactual forms to reduce gender bias and promote inclusivity. CDA augments corpora by swapping inherently gendered words, while CDS substitutes potentially biased text to avoid duplication. Combined with the Names Intervention, these methods effectively reduce direct and indirect gender bias in language models, improving word embeddings and reducing gender clustering. They outperform projection-based methods in generating non-biased gender analogies while maintaining grammatical accuracy across morphologically rich languages like Spanish and Hebrew. However, debiasing techniques can sometimes compromise language modeling ability, illustrating the complexity of balancing bias mitigation with performance [62,60,63,64]. The prefix-tuning method achieves performance comparable to full fine-tuning while learning only 0.1 Comprehensive evaluation of bias mitigation techniques is underscored by extensive benchmarks assessing various application scenarios, emphasizing the need for robust evaluation frameworks. Table provides a detailed comparison of different bias mitigation techniques for large language models, emphasizing their effectiveness and the frameworks used for evaluation. These frameworks are crucial for addressing representational biases—related to gender, race, and religion—in sensitive areas like healthcare, legal systems, and social sciences. New tools, including benchmarks and metrics, have been developed to measure and mitigate biases, exemplified by the HolisticBias dataset, which encompasses nearly 600 descriptor terms across 13 demographic axes. This dataset facilitates the identification and reduction of novel biases, advancing the balance of performance and fairness in language model applications [65,48]. By leveraging innovative data augmentation and substitution methods, researchers can enhance bias mitigation efforts in LLMs, ensuring equitable and reliable AI systems that respect human communication diversity and social norms. PowerTransformer employs an unsupervised approach to rewrite biased text, utilizing auxiliary tasks and pretrained language models to effectively address bias [31]. This method refines output distributions to mitigate gender bias while preserving performance [61]. SCTP analyzes LLM-generated text using SHAP to assess bias and applies targeted prompts for more favorable representations [30]. FairFil applies a fair filter network to debias sentence encodings while maintaining semantic integrity [22]. GEEP retains knowledge from the original training while incorporating new gender-related information, thus minimizing catastrophic forgetting [23]. The method adjusts the loss function during training to reduce gender bias in language model outputs [16]. Adversarial and Reinforcement Learning Approaches Adversarial and reinforcement learning approaches present innovative strategies for mitigating bias in large language models (LLMs), emphasizing competitive dynamics and iterative refinement to enhance fairness and accuracy. As illustrated in , which depicts the hierarchical categorization of bias mitigation strategies in LLMs, adversarial methods and reinforcement learning are central to this framework. Adversarial triggering, as proposed by [20], serves as a debiasing technique to address nationality bias in generated narratives, showcasing the effectiveness of adversarial methods in tackling specific biases. This approach leverages competitive dynamics between predictors and adversaries to navigate the complexities of bias mitigation while preserving performance. Reinforcement learning techniques further demonstrate efficacy in bias reduction, illustrated by experiments utilizing various bias evaluation metrics [16]. These experiments compare proposed methods against existing debiasing strategies, successfully reducing gender bias without increasing perplexity. The iterative nature of reinforcement learning allows models to continuously refine outputs, promoting self-awareness and adaptability in addressing biases. The integration of adversarial and reinforcement learning principles creates a comprehensive framework for bias mitigation in LLMs. This approach highlights the significance of competitive interactions and iterative refinement, employing adversarial learning to optimize predictions while minimizing bias related to protected attributes. It effectively addresses societal biases in LLMs, ensuring equal opportunity and fairness across applications, from analogy completion to information retrieval systems, without significantly compromising model accuracy [36,66,67,68,48]. These approaches are crucial for advancing the development of equitable AI systems that respect the diversity of human communication and social norms, ensuring fair and accurate outputs across diverse NLP tasks. Future Directions and Research Opportunities Innovative Techniques for Bias Mitigation Advancements in bias mitigation techniques for large language models (LLMs) are crucial for ensuring fairness and accuracy across diverse applications. Future research should enhance current methods and explore new strategies to address various biases. The Generative Adversarial Mitigation (GAM) method could be expanded to include more languages and contexts, increasing its utility in natural language processing (NLP) [29]. Similarly, frameworks like ADELE could be adapted to tackle a broader range of biases and languages, promoting inclusivity in AI systems [32]. Improving bias mitigation models involves integrating diverse datasets and extending methods like PowerTransformer to address biases beyond gender, enhancing effectiveness across contexts [31].

Nonetheless, biases in educational content and assessment criteria can reinforce existing inequalities, emphasizing the need for fair and unbiased educational AI systems [23]. These real-world applications and case studies reveal the dual potential and pitfalls of AI technologies, necessitating ongoing research and development to effectively address bias and fairness issues. By examining these applications, researchers and practitioners can gain insights into the complexities of bias in LLMs and develop strategies to promote fairness and inclusivity across diverse AI applications. Marginalized Language Users Bias impact on marginalized language users is a critical concern in deploying LLMs. Models trained on datasets lacking diversity or reflecting societal biases may produce outputs that disadvantage marginalized groups, including racial minorities, non-native speakers, and individuals using non-standard dialects. These biases manifest across applications, from language models to sentiment classifiers and hate speech detection systems, often perpetuating negative stereotypes and harmful generalizations in high-stakes areas like healthcare and legal systems. Such biases can affect text generation and downstream tasks, amplifying societal prejudices and stigmas associated with dialects like African-American English or groups linked to mental illness or lower educational attainment. Addressing these issues involves developing metrics for bias measurement and implementing strategies such as regularization methods to enhance fairness without compromising model performance [69,70,48,50,71]. Challenges faced by marginalized language users are compounded by inherent biases in language models, leading to misrepresentation and exclusion in various applications. A multifaceted approach is required to address these biases, including enhancing the diversity of training datasets, developing robust frameworks for bias measurement, and implementing inclusive design principles in AI systems. Unanswered questions regarding best practices for bias measurement and the implications of these biases in real-world applications highlight the need for ongoing research to refine detection and mitigation strategies, ensuring equitable service for all language users [18]. Inclusive solutions should prioritize representing marginalized language users in training datasets, incorporating diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. This approach aims to mitigate social biases related to gender, race, and intersectional identities often encoded in language models. By enhancing the fairness and accuracy of language model outputs, particularly in sensitive applications like healthcare and legal systems, these solutions can foster equitable and human-like text generation in dialogue systems, improving user engagement and satisfaction [39,55,48,49,50]. Moreover, developing evaluation frameworks that prioritize inclusivity and fairness in language processing is essential for identifying and mitigating biases affecting marginalized groups. By adopting these strategies, researchers and developers can work toward creating AI systems that respect the diversity of human communication and promote equitable treatment for all language users. Conclusion This survey underscores the widespread presence of bias in large language models (LLMs), particularly its impact on various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It identifies significant racial biases within contextual word models, with intersectional minorities facing heightened adverse effects. Dialogue generation techniques have shown promise in mitigating gender bias, leading to more equitable outputs. While self-debiasing methods do not fully eradicate biased text generation, they substantially decrease its occurrence, marking a critical step forward in tackling bias in NLP. The necessity for specialized approaches in multilingual settings is apparent, particularly for languages with complex gender marking, signaling a need for continued research to develop effective methodologies for diverse linguistic contexts. The survey stresses the importance of elucidating the relationships among different methods and addressing model selection challenges to improve fairness in NLP. It cautions researchers against presuming a direct link between association bias and empirical fairness, advocating for separate assessments of these metrics. Aligning language models with human feedback through fine-tuning significantly improves their alignment with user intent, enhancing truthfulness and reducing toxicity. The feasibility of measuring and mitigating gendered correlations in pre-trained models is established, with implications for developing fairer AI systems. Proposed methods can significantly reduce gender bias amplification in predicted distributions with minimal performance impact, contributing to a deeper understanding of bias in machine learning. Despite growing awareness of gender complexities, few approaches effectively incorporate this understanding, highlighting the need for ongoing exploration and integration of intersectional perspectives. The survey reinforces the crucial importance of addressing bias and fairness in LLMs and the necessity for continuous research and ethical considerations in AI development. By advancing bias mitigation strategies and promoting inclusivity, researchers can contribute to the creation of equitable AI systems that respect the diversity and intricacy of human communication.",
