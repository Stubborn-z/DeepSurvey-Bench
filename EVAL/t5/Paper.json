  "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are gaining increasing popularity in both\nacademia and industry, owing to their unprecedented performance in various\napplications. As LLMs continue to play a vital role in both research and daily\nuse, their evaluation becomes increasingly critical, not only at the task\nlevel, but also at the society level for better understanding of their\npotential risks. Over the past years, significant efforts have been made to\nexamine LLMs from various perspectives. This paper presents a comprehensive\nreview of these evaluation methods for LLMs, focusing on three key dimensions:\nwhat to evaluate, where to evaluate, and how to evaluate. Firstly, we provide\nan overview from the perspective of evaluation tasks, encompassing general\nnatural language processing tasks, reasoning, medical usage, ethics,\neducations, natural and social sciences, agent applications, and other areas.\nSecondly, we answer the `where' and `how' questions by diving into the\nevaluation methods and benchmarks, which serve as crucial components in\nassessing performance of LLMs. Then, we summarize the success and failure cases\nof LLMs in different tasks. Finally, we shed light on several future challenges\nthat lie ahead in LLMs evaluation. Our aim is to offer invaluable insights to\nresearchers in the realm of LLMs evaluation, thereby aiding the development of\nmore proficient LLMs. Our key point is that evaluation should be treated as an\nessential discipline to better assist the development of LLMs. We consistently\nmaintain the related open-source materials at:\nhttps://github.com/MLGroupJLU/LLM-eval-survey.",

figure* Within the scope of AI, the Turing Test~turing2009computing, a widely recognized test for assessing intelligence by discerning if responses are of human or machine origin, has been a longstanding objective in AI evolution. It is generally believed among researchers that a computing machine that successfully passes the Turing Test can be considered as intelligent. Consequently, when viewed from a wider lens, the chronicle of AI can be depicted as the timeline of creation and evaluation of intelligent models and algorithms. With each emergence of a novel AI model or algorithm, researchers invariably scrutinize its capabilities in real-world scenarios through evaluation using specific and challenging tasks. For instance, the Perceptron algorithm~gallant1990perceptron, touted as an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) approach in the 1950s, was later revealed as inadequate due to its inability to resolve the XOR problem. The subsequent rise and application of Support Vector Machines (SVMs)~cortes1995support and deep learning~lecun2015deep have marked both progress and setbacks in the AI landscape. A significant takeaway from previous attempts is the paramount importance of AI evaluation, which serves as a critical tool to identify current system limitations and inform the design of more powerful models. Recently, large language models (\\llms) have incited substantial interest across both academic and industrial domains~wei2022emergent,bommasani2021opportunities,zhao2023survey. As demonstrated by existing work~bubeck2023sparks, the great performance of \\llms has raised promise that they could be AGI in this era. \\llms possess the capabilities to solve diverse tasks, contrasting with prior models confined to solving specific tasks. Due to its great performance in handling different applications such as general natural language tasks and domain-specific ones, \\llms are increasingly used by individuals with critical information needs, such as students or patients. Evaluation is of paramount prominence to the success of \\llms due to several reasons. First, evaluating \\llms helps us better understand the strengths and weakness of \\llms. For instance, the PromptBench~zhu2023promptbench benchmark illustrates that current \\llms are sensitive to adversarial prompts, thus a careful prompt engineering is necessary for better performance. Second, better evaluations can provide better guidance for human-\\llms interaction, which could inspire future interaction design and implementation. Third, the broad applicability of \\llms underscores the paramount importance of ensuring their safety and reliability, particularly in safety-sensitive sectors such as financial institutions and healthcare facilities. Finally, as \\llms are becoming larger with more emergent abilities, existing evaluation protocols may not be enough to evaluate their capabilities and potential risks. Therefore, we aim to raise awareness in the community of the importance to \\llms evaluations by reviewing the current evaluation protocols and most importantly, shed light on future research about designing new \\llms evaluation protocols. With the introduction of ChatGPT~chatgpt and GPT-4~openai2023gpt4, there have been a number of research efforts aiming at evaluating ChatGPT and other \\llms from different aspects (\\figurename~fig-numbers), encompassing a range of factors such as natural language tasks, reasoning, robustness, trustworthiness, medical applications, and ethical considerations. Despite these efforts, a comprehensive overview capturing the entire gamut of evaluations is still lacking. Furthermore, the ongoing evolution of \\llms has also presented novel aspects for evaluation, thereby challenging existing evaluation protocols and reinforcing the need for thorough, multifaceted evaluation techniques. While existing research such as bubeck2023sparks claimed that GPT-4 can be seen as sparks of AGI, others contest this claim due to the human-crafted nature of its evaluation approach. This paper serves as the first comprehensive survey on the evaluation of large language models. As depicted in \\figurename~fig-main, we explore existing work in three dimensions: 1) What to evaluate, 2) Where to evaluate, and 3) How to evaluate. Specifically, ``what to evaluate\" encapsulates existing evaluation tasks for \\llms, ``where to evaluate\" involves selecting appropriate datasets and benchmarks for evaluation, while ``how to evaluate\" is concerned with the evaluation process given appropriate tasks and datasets. These three dimensions are integral to the evaluation of \\llms. We subsequently discuss potential future challenges in the realm of \\llms evaluation. The contributions of this paper are as follows: enumerate \\item We provide a comprehensive overview of \\llms evaluations from three aspects: what to evaluate, where to evaluate, and how to evaluate. Our categorization is general and encompasses the entire life cycle of \\llms evaluation. \\item Regarding what to evaluate, we summarize existing tasks in various areas and obtain insightful conclusions on the success and failure case of \\llms (Sec.~sec-summary), providing experience for future research. \\item As for where to evaluate, we summarize evaluation metrics, datasets, and benchmarks to provide a profound understanding of current \\llms evaluations. In terms of how to evaluate, we explore current protocols and summarize novel evaluation approaches. \\item We further discuss future challenges in evaluating \\llms. We open-source and maintain the related materials of \\llms evaluation at https://github.com/MLGroupJLU/LLM-eval-survey to foster a collaborative community for better evaluations. enumerate The paper is organized as follows. In Sec.~sec-back, we provide the basic information of \\llms and AI model evaluation. Then, Sec.~sec-what reviews existing work from the aspects of ``what to evaluate''. After that, Sec.~sec-where is the ``where to evaluate'' part, which summarizes existing datasets and benchmarks. Sec.~sec-how discusses how to perform the evaluation. In Sec.~sec-summary, we summarize the key findings of this paper. We discuss grand future challenges in Sec.~sec-challenge and Sec.~sec-con concludes the paper.",

      "content": "Language models (LMs) gao2004introduction,kombrink2011recurrent,devlin2018bert are computational models that have the capability to understand and generate human language. LMs have the transformative ability to predict the likelihood of word sequences or generate new text based on a given input. N-gram models brown1992class, the most common type of LM, estimate word probabilities based on the preceding context. However, LMs also face challenges, such as the issue of rare or unseen words, the problem of overfitting, and the difficulty in capturing complex linguistic phenomena. Researchers are continuously working on improving LM architectures and training methods to address these challenges. Large Language Models (LLMs) kasneci2023chatgpt,zhao2023survey,chen2021evaluating are advanced language models with massive parameter sizes and exceptional learning capabilities. The core module behind many LLMs such as GPT-3 floridi2020gpt, InstructGPT ouyang2022training, and GPT-4 openai2023gpt4 is the self-attention module in Transformer vaswani2017attention that serves as the fundamental building block for language modeling tasks. Transformers have revolutionized the field of NLP with their ability to handle sequential data efficiently, allowing for parallelization and capturing long-range dependencies in text. One key feature of \\llms is in-context learning brown2020language, where the model is trained to generate text based on a given context or prompt. This enables LLMs to generate more coherent and contextually relevant responses, making them suitable for interactive and conversational applications. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) ziegler2019fine,christiano2017deep is another crucial aspect of \\llms. This technique involves fine-tuning the model using human-generated responses as rewards, allowing the model to learn from its mistakes and improve its performance over time. In an autoregressive language model, such as GPT-3 and PaLM chowdhery2022palm, given a context sequence \\(X\\), the LM tasks aim to predict the next token \\(y\\). The model is trained by maximizing the probability of the given token sequence conditioned on the context, i.e., $P(y | X) = P(y | x_1, x_2, ..., x_{t-1})$, where \\(x_1, x_2, ..., x_{t-1}\\) are the tokens in the context sequence, and \\(t\\) is the current position. By using the chain rule, the conditional probability can be decomposed into a product of probabilities at each position: equation* P(y | X) = \\prod_{t=1}^{T} P(y_t | x_1, x_2, ..., x_{t-1}), equation* where \\(T\\) is sequence length. In this way, the model predicts each token at each position in an autoregressive manner, generating a complete text sequence. One common approach to interacting with \\llms is prompt engineering zhou2022large,white2023prompt,clavie2023large, where users design and provide specific prompt texts to guide LLMs in generating desired responses or completing specific tasks. This is widely adopted in existing evaluation efforts. People can also engage in question-and-answer interactions jansson2021online, where they pose questions to the model and receive answers, or engage in dialogue interactions, having natural language conversations with LLMs. In conclusion, \\llms, with their Transformer architecture, in-context learning, and RLHF capabilities, have revolutionized NLP and hold promise in various applications. \\tablename~tb-compare provides a brief comparison of traditional ML, deep learning, and \\llms.",

      "content": "AI model evaluation is an essential step in assessing the performance of a model. There are some standard model evaluation protocols, including \\(k\\)-fold cross-validation, holdout validation, leave one out cross-validation (LOOCV), bootstrap, and reduced set kohavi1995study,berrar2019cross. For instance, \\(k\\)-fold cross-validation divides the dataset into \\(k\\) parts, with one part used as a test set and the rest as training sets, which can reduce training data loss and obtain relatively more accurate model performance evaluation~fushiki2011estimation; Holdout validation divides the dataset into training and test sets, with a smaller calculation amount but potentially more significant bias; LOOCV is a unique \\(k\\)-fold cross-validation method where only one data point is used as the test set~wong2015performance; Reduced set trains the model with one dataset and tests it with the remaining data, which is computationally simple, but the applicability is limited. The appropriate evaluation method should be chosen according to the specific problem and data characteristics for more reliable performance indicators. \\figurename~fig-eval-proc illustrates the evaluation process of AI models, including \\llms. Some evaluation protocols may not be feasible to evaluate deep learning models due to the extensive training size. Thus, evaluation on a static validation set has long been the standard choice for deep learning models. For instance, computer vision models leverage static test sets such as ImageNet~deng2009imagenet and MS COCO~lin2014microsoft for evaluation. \\llms also use GLUE~wang2018glue or SuperGLUE~wang2019superglue as the common test sets. As \\llms are becoming more popular with even poorer interpretability, existing evaluation protocols may not be enough to evaluate the true capabilities of \\llms thoroughly.

      "content": "Natural language understanding represents a wide spectrum of tasks that aims to obtain a better understanding of the input sequence. We summarize recent efforts in \\llms evaluation from several aspects. Sentiment analysis is a task that analyzes and interprets the text to determine the emotional inclination. It is typically a binary (positive and negative) or triple (positive, neutral, and negative) class classification problem. Evaluating sentiment analysis tasks is a popular direction. liang2022holistic and zeng2022glm showed that the performance of the models on this task is usually high. ChatGPT's sentiment analysis prediction performance is superior to traditional sentiment analysis methods lopez2023can and comes close to that of GPT-3.5 qin2023chatgpt. In fine-grained sentiment and emotion cause analysis, ChatGPT also exhibits exceptional performance wang2023chatgpt1. In low-resource learning environments, \\llms exhibit significant advantages over small language models zhang2023sentiment, but the ability of ChatGPT to understand low-resource languages is limited bang2023multitask. In conclusion, \\llms have demonstrated commendable performance in sentiment analysis tasks. Future work should focus on enhancing their capability to understand emotions in under-resourced languages. Text classification and sentiment analysis are related fields, text classification not only focuses on sentiment, but also includes the processing of all texts and tasks. The work of liang2022holistic showed that GLM-130B was the best-performed model, with an overall accuracy of 85.8\\% for miscellaneous text classification. yang2023large found that ChatGPT can produce credibility ratings for a wide range of news outlets, and these ratings have a moderate correlation with those from human experts. Furthermore, ChatGPT achieves acceptable accuracy in a binary classification scenario (AUC=0.89). pena2023leveraging discussed the problem of topic classification for public affairs documents and showed that using an LLM backbone in combination with SVM classifiers is a useful strategy to conduct the multi-label topic classification task in the domain of public affairs with accuracies over 85\\%. Overall, \\llms perform well on text classification and can even handle text classification tasks in unconventional problem settings as well. Natural language inference (NLI) is the task of determining whether the given ``hypothesis'' logically follows from the ``premise''. qin2023chatgpt showed that ChatGPT outperforms GPT-3.5 for NLI tasks. They also found that ChatGPT excels in handling factual input that could be attributed to its RLHF training process in favoring human feedback. However, lee2023can observed \\llms perform poorly in the scope of NLI and further fail in representing human disagreement, which indicates that \\llms still have a large room for improvement in this field. Semantic understanding refers to the meaning or understanding of language and its associated concepts. It involves the interpretation and comprehension of words, phrases, sentences, and the relationships between them. Semantic processing goes beyond the surface level and focuses on understanding the underlying meaning and intent. tao2023eveval comprehensively evaluated the event semantic processing abilities of \\llms covering understanding, reasoning, and prediction about the event semantics. Results indicated that \\llms possess an understanding of individual events, but their capacity to perceive the semantic similarity among events is constrained. In reasoning tasks, \\llms exhibit robust reasoning abilities in causal and intentional relations, yet their performance in other relation types is comparatively weaker. In prediction tasks, \\llms exhibit enhanced predictive capabilities for future events with increased contextual information. riccardi2023two explored the semantic proficiency of \\llms and showed that these models perform poorly in evaluating basic phrases. Furthermore, GPT-3.5 and Bard cannot distinguish between meaningful and nonsense phrases, consistently classifying highly nonsense phrases as meaningful. GPT-4 shows significant improvements, but its performance is still significantly lower than that of humans. In summary, the performance of \\llms in semantic understanding tasks is poor. In the future, we can start from this aspect and focus on improving its performance on this application. In social knowledge understanding, choi2023llms evaluated how well models perform at learning and recognizing concepts of social knowledge and the results revealed that despite being much smaller in the number of parameters, finetuning supervised models such as BERT lead to much better performance than zero-shot models using state-of-the-art \\llms, such as GPT radford2018improving, GPT-J-6B wang2021gpt and so on. This statement demonstrates that supervised models significantly outperform zero-shot models in terms of performance, highlighting that an increase in parameters does not necessarily guarantee a higher level of social knowledge in this particular scenario.",

      "content": "The task of reasoning poses significant challenges for an intelligent AI model. To effectively tackle reasoning tasks, the models need to not only comprehend the provided information but also utilize reasoning and inference to deduce answers when explicit responses are absent. \\tablename~tb-what-nlptask reveals that there is a growing interest in evaluating the reasoning ability of \\llms, as evidenced by the increasing number of articles focusing on exploring this aspect. Currently, the evaluation of reasoning tasks can be broadly categorized into mathematical reasoning, commonsense reasoning, logical reasoning, and domain-specific reasoning. ChatGPT exhibits a strong capability for arithmetic reasoning by outperforming GPT-3.5 in the majority of tasks qin2023chatgpt. However, its proficiency in mathematical reasoning still requires improvement bang2023multitask,frieder2023mathematical, zhuang2023efficiently. On symbolic reasoning tasks, ChatGPT is mostly worse than GPT-3.5, which may be because ChatGPT is prone to uncertain responses, leading to poor performance bang2023multitask. Through the poor performance of \\llms on task variants of counterfactual conditions, wu2023reasoning showed that the current \\llms have certain limitations in abstract reasoning ability. On abstract reasoning, gendron2023large found that existing \\llms have very limited ability. In logical reasoning, liu2023evaluating indicated that ChatGPT and GPT-4 outperform traditional fine-tuning methods on most benchmarks, demonstrating their superiority in logical reasoning. However, both models face challenges when handling new and out-of-distribution data. ChatGPT does not perform as well as other \\llms, including GPT-3.5 and BARD xu2023large,qin2023chatgpt. This is because ChatGPT is designed explicitly for chatting, so it does an excellent job of maintaining rationality. FLAN-T5, LLaMA, GPT-3.5, and PaLM perform well in general deductive reasoning tasks saparov2023testing. GPT-3.5 is not good at keeping oriented for reasoning in the inductive setting xu2023large. For multi-step reasoning, fu2023chain showed PaLM and Claude2 are the only two model families that achieve similar performance (but still worse than the GPT model family). Moreover, LLaMA-65B is the most robust open-source \\llms to date, which performs closely to code-davinci-002. Some papers separately evaluate the performance of ChatGPT on some reasoning tasks: ChatGPT generally performs poorly on commonsense reasoning tasks, but relatively better than non-text semantic reasoning bang2023multitask. Meanwhile, ChatGPT also lacks spatial reasoning ability, but exhibits better temporal reasoning. Finally, while the performance of ChatGPT is acceptable on causal and analogical reasoning, it performs poorly on multi-hop reasoning ability, which is similar to the weakness of other \\llms on complex reasoning ott2023thoughtsource. In professional domain reasoning tasks, zero-shot InstructGPT and Codex are capable of complex medical reasoning tasks, but still need to be further improved lievin2022can. In terms of language insight issues, orru2023human demonstrated the potential of ChatGPT for solving verbal insight problems, as ChatGPT's performance was comparable to that of human participants. It should be noted that most of the above conclusions are obtained for specific data sets. In contrast, more complex tasks have become the mainstream benchmarks for assessing the capabilities of \\llms. These include tasks such as mathematical reasoning zhang2023evaluating1,wu2022autoformalization,yu2023metamath and structured data inference pan2023unifying,jiang2023structgpt. Overall, \\llms show great potential in reasoning and show a continuous improvement trend, but still face many challenges and limitations, requiring more in-depth research and optimization.",

      "content": "NLG evaluates the capabilities of \\llms in generating specific texts, which consists of several tasks, including summarization, dialogue generation, machine translation, question answering, and other open-ended generation tasks. Summarization is a generation task that aims to learn a concise abstract for the given sentence. In this evaluation, liang2022holistic found that TNLG v2 (530B) smith2022using achieved the highest score in both scenarios, followed by OPT (175B) zhang2022opt in second place. The fine-tuned Bart lewis2019bart is still better than zero-shot ChatGPT. Specifically, ChatGPT demonstrates comparable zero-shot performance to the text-davinci-002 bang2023multitask, but performs worse than GPT-3.5 qin2023chatgpt. These findings indicate that \\llms, particularly ChatGPT, have a general performance in summarization tasks. Evaluating the performance of \\llms on dialogue tasks is crucial to the development of dialogue systems and improving human-computer interaction. Through such evaluation, the natural language processing ability, context understanding ability and generation ability of the model can be improved, so as to realize a more intelligent and more natural dialogue system. Both Claude and ChatGPT generally achieve better performance across all dimensions when compared to GPT-3.5 qin2023chatgpt,lin2023llm. When comparing the Claude and ChatGPT models, both models demonstrate competitive performance across different evaluation dimensions, with Claude slightly outperforming ChatGPT in specific configurations. Research by bang2023multitask underscores that fully fine-tuned models tailored for specific tasks surpass ChatGPT in both task-oriented and knowledge-based dialogue contexts. Additionally, zheng2023lmsys have curated a comprehensive LLMs conversation dataset, LMSYS-Chat-1M, encompassing up to one million samples. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for evaluating and advancing dialogue systems. While \\llms are not explicitly trained for translation tasks, they can still demonstrate strong performance. wang2023document demonstrated that ChatGPT and GPT-4 exhibit superior performance in comparison to commercial machine translation (MT) systems, as evaluated by humans. Additionally, they outperform most document-level NMT methods in terms of sacreBLEU scores. During contrastive testing, ChatGPT shows lower accuracy in comparison to traditional translation models. However, GPT-4 demonstrates a robust capability in explaining discourse knowledge, even though it may occasionally select incorrect translation candidates. The findings from bang2023multitask indicated that ChatGPT performs X $\\to$ Eng translation well, but it still lacks the ability to perform Eng $\\to$ X translation. lyu2023new investigated several research directions in MT utilizing \\llms. This study significantly contributes to the advancement of MT research and highlights the potential of LLMs in enhancing translation capabilities. In summary, while \\llms perform satisfactorily in several translation tasks, there is still room for improvement, e.g., enhancing the translation capability from English to non-English languages. Question answering is a crucial technology in the field of human-computer interaction, and it has found wide application in scenarios like search engines, intelligent customer service, and QA systems. The measurement of accuracy and efficiency in QA models will have significant implications for these applications. According to liang2022holistic, among all the evaluated models, InstructGPT davinci v2 (175B) exhibited the highest performance in terms of accuracy, robustness, and fairness across the 9 QA scenarios. Both GPT-3.5 and ChatGPT demonstrate significant advancements compared to GPT-3 in their ability to answer general knowledge questions. In most domains, ChatGPT surpasses GPT-3.5 by more than 2\\% in terms of performance bian2023chatgpt,qin2023chatgpt. However, ChatGPT performs slightly weaker than GPT-3.5 on the CommonsenseQA and Social IQA benchmarks. This can be attributed to ChatGPT’s cautious nature, as it tends to decline to provide an answer when there is insufficient information available. Fine-tuned models, such as Vícuna and ChatGPT, exhibit exceptional performance with near-perfect scores, surpassing models that lack supervised fine-tuning by a significant margin bang2023multitask,bai2023benchmarking. laskar2023systematic evaluated the effectiveness of ChatGPT on a range of academic datasets, including various tasks such as answering questions, summarizing text, generating code, reasoning with commonsense, solving math problems, translating languages, detecting bias, and addressing ethical issues. Overall, \\llms showcase flawless performance on QA tasks and hold the potential for further enhancing their proficiency in social, event, and temporal commonsense knowledge in the future. There are also other generation tasks to explore. In the field of sentence style transfer, pu2023chatgpt demonstrated that ChatGPT surpasses the previous SOTA supervised model through training on the same subset for few-shot learning, as evident from the higher BLEU score. However, when it comes to controlling the formality of sentence style, ChatGPT’s performance still differs significantly from human behavior. In writing tasks, chia2023instructeval discovered that \\llms exhibit consistent performance across various categories such as informative, professional, argumentative, and creative writing. This finding implies that \\llms possess a general proficiency in writing capabilities. In text generation quality, chen2023exploring revealed that ChatGPT excels in assessing text quality from multiple angles, even in the absence of reference texts, surpassing the performance of most existing automated metrics. Employing ChatGPT to generate numerical scores for text quality emerged as the most reliable and effective approach among the various testing methods studied.",

      "content": "While English is the predominant language, many \\llms are trained on mixed-language training data. The combination of multilingual data indeed helps \\llms gain the ability to process inputs and generate responses in different languages, making them widely adopted and accepted across the globe. However, due to the relatively recent emergence of this technology, \\llms are primarily evaluated on English data, leading to a potential oversight of evaluating their multilingual performance. To address this, several articles have provided comprehensive, open, and independent evaluations of \\llms' performance on various NLP tasks in different non-English languages. These evaluations offer valuable insights for future research and applications. abdelali2023benchmarking evaluated the performance of ChatGPT in standard Arabic NLP tasks and observed that ChatGPT exhibits lower performance compared to SOTA models in the zero-shot setting for most tasks. bang2023multitask,zhang2023m3exam,lai2023chatgpt, ahuja2023mega utilized a greater number of languages across multiple datasets, encompassing a wider range of tasks, and conducted a more comprehensive evaluation of \\llms, including BLOOM, Vicuna, Claude, ChatGPT, and GPT-4. The results indicated that these \\llms perform poorly when it came to non-Latin languages and languages with limited resources. Despite translating the input to English and using it as the query, generative \\llms still displays subpar performance across tasks and languages compared to SOTA models ahuja2023mega. Furthermore, bang2023multitask highlighted that ChatGPT still faces a limitation in translating sentences written in non-Latin script languages with rich linguistic resources. The aforementioned demonstrates that there are numerous challenges and ample opportunities for enhancement in multilingual tasks for \\llms. Future research should prioritize achieving multilingual balance and addressing the challenges faced by non-Latin languages and low-resource languages, with the aim of better supporting users worldwide. At the same time, attention should be paid to the impartiality and neutrality of the language in order to mitigate any potential biases, including English bias or other biases, that could impact multilingual applications.",

      "section_title": "Factuality",
      "level": "3",
      "content": "Factuality in the context of \\llms refers to the extent to which the information or answers provided by the model align with real-world truths and verifiable facts. Factuality in \\llms significantly impacts a variety of tasks and downstream applications, such as QA systems, information extraction, text summarization, dialogue systems, and automated fact-checking, where incorrect or inconsistent information could lead to substantial misunderstandings and misinterpretations. Evaluating factuality is of great importance in order to trust and efficiently use these models. This includes the ability of these models to maintain consistency with known facts, avoid generating misleading or false information (known as ``factual hallucination\"), and effectively learn and recall factual knowledge. A range of methodologies have been proposed to measure and improve the factuality of \\llms. wang2023evaluating assessed the internal knowledge capabilities of several large models, namely InstructGPT, ChatGPT-3.5, GPT-4, and BingChat BingChat, by examining their ability to answer open questions based on the Natural Questions NQ and TriviaQA TQ datasets. The evaluation process involved human assessment. The results of the study indicated that while GPT-4 and BingChat can provide correct answers for more than 80\\% of the questions, there is still a remaining gap of over 15\\% to achieve complete accuracy. In the work of honovich2022true, they conducted a review of current factual consistency evaluation methods and highlighted the absence of a unified comparison framework and the limited reference value of related scores compared to binary labels. To address this, they transformed existing fact consistency tasks into binary labels, specifically considering only whether there is a factual conflict with the input text, without factoring in external knowledge. The research discovered that fact evaluation methods founded on natural language inference and question generation answering exhibit superior performance and can complement each other. pezeshkpour2023measuring proposed a novel metric, based on information theory, to assess the inclusion of specific knowledge in \\llms. The metric utilized the concept of uncertainty in knowledge to measure factualness, calculated by \\llms filling in prompts and examining the probability distribution of the answer. The paper discussed two methods for injecting knowledge into \\llms: explicit inclusion of knowledge in the prompts and implicit fine-tuning of the \\llms using knowledge-related data. The study demonstrated that this approach surpasses traditional ranking methods by achieving an accuracy improvement of over 30\\%. gekhman2023trueteacher improved the method for evaluating fact consistency in summarization tasks. It proposed a novel approach that involved training student NLI models using summaries generated by multiple models and annotated by \\llms to ensure fact consistency. The trained student model was then used for summarization fact consistency evaluation. manakul2023selfcheckgpt operated on two hypotheses regarding how \\llms generate factual or hallucinated responses. It proposed the use of three formulas (BERTScore zhang2019bertscore, MQAG manakul2023mqag and n-gram) to evaluate factuality and employed alternative \\llms to gather token probabilities for black-box language models. The study discovered that simply computing sentence likelihood or entropy helped validate the factuality of the responses. min2023factscore broke down text generated by \\llms into individual ``atomic\" facts, which were then evaluated for their correctness. The FActScore is used to measure the performance of estimators through the calculation of F1 scores. The paper tested various estimators and revealed that current estimators still have some way to go in effectively addressing the task. lin2021truthfulqa introduced the TruthfulQA dataset, designed to cause models to make mistakes. Multiple language models were tested by providing factual answers. The findings from these experiments suggest that simply scaling up model sizes may not necessarily improve their truthfulness, and recommendations are provided for the training approach.

The results of this study emphasize the potential risks to the overall system security when manipulating visual input. For vision-language models, zhao2023evaluating evaluated \\llms on visual input and transferred them to other visual-linguistic models, revealing the vulnerability of visual input. li2023survey provided an overview of OOD evaluation for language models: adversarial robustness, domain generalization, and dataset biases. Bridging these lines of research, the authors conducted a comparative analysis, unifying the three approaches. They succinctly outlined the data-generation processes and evaluation protocols for each line of study, all while emphasizing the prevailing challenges and future research prospects. Additionally, liu2023mitigating introduced a large-scale robust visual instruction dataset to enhance the performance of large-scale multi-modal models in handling relevant images and human instructions. For adversarial robustness, zhu2023promptbench evaluated the robustness of \\llms to prompts by proposing a unified benchmark called PromptBench. They comprehensively evaluated adversarial text attacks at multiple levels (character, word, sentence, and semantics). The results showed that contemporary \\llms are vulnerable to adversarial prompts, highlighting the importance of the models' robustness when facing adversarial inputs.

More recently, zhuo2023exploring used conventional testing sets and metrics~gehman2020realtoxicityprompts,dhamala2021bold,parrish2022bbq to perform a systematic evaluation of ChatGPT's toxicity and social bias, finding that it still exhibits noxious content to some extend. Taking a further step, deshpande2023toxicity introduced role-playing into the model and observed an increase in generated toxicity up to 6x. Furthermore, such role-playing also caused biased toxicity towards specific entities. Different from simply measuring social biases, ferrara2023should investigated the sources, underlying mechanisms, and corresponding ethical consequences of these biases potentially produced by ChatGPT. Beyond social biases, LLMs have also been assessed by political tendency and personality traits~rutinowski2023self,hartmann2023political based questionnaires like the Political Compass Test and MBTI test, demonstrating a propensity for progressive views and an ENFJ personality type. In addition, LLMs like GPT-3 were found to have moral biases~simmons2022moral in terms of the Moral Foundation theory~graham2013moral; The study conducted by~hendrycks2020aligning~reveals that existing LMs have potential in ethical judgment, but still need improvement. zhao2023chbias proposes a Chinese conversational bias evaluation dataset CHBias, discovers bias risks in pre-trained models, and explores debiasing methods.

In their 2023 study, DecodingTrust, wang2023decodingtrust offered a multifaceted exploration of trustworthiness vulnerabilities in the GPT models, especially GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Their evaluation expanded beyond the typical trustworthiness concerns to include eight critical aspects: toxicity, stereotype bias, adversarial and out-of-distribution robustness, robustness to adversarial demonstrations, privacy, machine ethics, and fairness. DecodingTrust's investigation employs an array of newly constructed scenarios, tasks, and metrics. They revealed that while GPT-4 often showcases improved trustworthiness over GPT-3.5 in standard evaluations, it is simultaneously more susceptible to attacks. In another study by hagendorff2023humanlike, \\llms with enhanced cognitive abilities were evaluated. They found that these models can avoid common human intuitions and cognitive errors, demonstrating super-rational performance. By utilizing cognitive reflection tests and semantic illusion experiments, the researchers gained insights into the psychological aspects of \\llms. This method offers new perspectives for evaluating model biases and ethical issues that may not have been previously identified. Furthermore, a study by xie2023ask brings attention to a significant concern: the consistency of judgment in \\llms diminishes notably when faced with disruptions such as questioning, negation, or misleading cues, even if their initial judgments were accurate. The research delves into various prompting methods designed to mitigate this issue and successfully demonstrates their efficacy. \\llms are capable of generating coherent and seemingly factual text. However, the information generated can include factual inaccuracies or statements ungrounded in reality, a phenomenon known as hallucination rawte2023survey,zhang2023sirens.

      "content": "Automated evaluation is a common, and perhaps the most popular, evaluation method that typically uses standard metrics and evaluation tools to evaluate model performance. Compared with human evaluation, automatic evaluation does not require intensive human participation, which not only saves time, but also reduces the impact of human subjective factors and makes the evaluation process more standardized. For example, both qin2023chatgpt and bang2023multitask use automated evaluation methods to evaluate a large number of tasks. Recently, with the development of \\llms, some advanced automatic evaluation techniques are also designed to help evaluate. lin2023llm proposed LLM-EVAL, a unified multidimensional automatic evaluation method for open-domain conversations with \\llms. PandaLM~wang2023pandalm can achieve reproducible and automated language model assessment by training an LLM that serves as the ``judge'' to evaluate different models. Proposing a self-supervised evaluation framework, jain2023bring enabled a more efficient form of evaluating models in real-world deployment by eliminating the need for laborious labeling of new data.

The key metrics include the following four aspects: enumerate[leftmargin=2em] \\setlength0em \\item Accuracy is a measure of how correct a model is on a given task. The concept of accuracy may vary in different scenarios and is dependent on the specific task and problem definition. It can be measured using various metrics such as Exact Match, F1 score, and ROUGE score. itemize \\item Exact Match (EM) is a metric used to evaluate whether the model's output in text generation tasks precisely matches the reference answer. In question answering tasks, if the model's generated answer is an exact match with the manually provided answer, the EM is 1; otherwise, it is 0. \\item The F1 score is a metric for evaluating the performance of binary classification models, combining the model's precision and recall. The formula for calculation is as follows: \\(F1=2\\times Precision \\times Recall {Precision + Recall} \\). \\item ROUGE is primarily employed to assess the performance of tasks such as text summarization and machine translation, involving considerations of overlap and matching between texts. itemize \\item Calibrations pertains to the degree of agreement between the confidence level of the model output and the actual prediction accuracy. itemize \\item Expected Calibration Error (ECE) is one of the commonly used metrics to evaluate model calibration performance~guo2017calibration. tian2023just utilized ECE to study the calibration of RLHF-LMs, including ChatGPT, GPT-4, Claude 1, Claude 2 and Llama2. For the calculation of ECE, they categorize model predictions based on confidence and measure the average accuracy of the predictions within each confidence interval. \\item Area Under the Curve of selective accuracy and coverage (AUC)~geifman2017selective is another commonly used metric. itemize \\item Fairness refers to whether the model treats different groups consistently, that is, whether the model's performance is equal across different groups. This can include attributes such as gender, race, age, and more. DecodingTrust~wang2023decodingtrust employs the following two metrics for measuring fairness: itemize \\item Demographic Parity Pifference (DPD) measures whether the model's predictions are distributed equally across different population groups. If predictions differ significantly between groups, the DPD is high, indicating that the model may be unfairly biased against different groups. The calculation of DPD involves the prediction of the model and the true label, and the following formula can be used: \\(DPD=P(y|Z=1)-P(y|Z=0)\\), where \\(y\\) is the binary classification prediction of the model, Z is the identifier of the population group (usually binary, indicating two different groups, such as men and women), \\(P(y|Z=1)\\) and \\(P(y|Z=0)\\) respectively represent the probabilities of predicting the positive class in population \\(Z=1\\) and \\(Z=0\\). \\item Equalized Odds Difference (EOD) aims to ensure that the model provides equal error rates across different populations, that is, the model's prediction error probability distribution is similar for different populations. The calculation of EOD involves probabilities related to true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN) predictions. The formula for EOD is as follows: \\(max \\{ P(y=1|Y=1,Z=1) - P(y=1|Y=1,Z=0), P(y=1|Y=0,Z=1) - P(y=1|Y=0,Z=0)\\} \\) where \\(y\\) is the binary classification prediction of the model, \\(Y\\) is the true label, \\(Z\\) is the demographic group identifier (typically binary, representing two different groups), and \\(P(y=1|Y=1,Z=1)\\) denotes the probability of the model predicting a positive class when the true label is positive and belongs to group \\(Z=1\\). itemize \\item Robustness evaluates the performance of a model in the face of various challenging inputs, including adversarial attacks, changes in data distribution, noise, etc. itemize \\item Attack Success Rate (ASR) serves as a metric for evaluating the adversarial robustness of \\llms~wang2023robustness. Specifically, consider a dataset \\(D =\\left \\{ (x_{i},y_{i} ) \\right \\}_{i=1}^{N} \\) containing \\(N\\) pairs of samples \\(x_{i}\\) and ground truth \\(y_{i}\\). For an adversarial attack method \\(A\\), given an input \\(x\\), this method can produce adversarial examples \\(A(x)\\) to attack surrogate model \\(f\\), with the success rate is calculated as: \\(ASR=\\sum_{(x,y \\in D )} \\mathcal{I\\left [ f(A(x) )\\ne y \\right ] }{I \\left [ f(x)=y \\right ] } \\), where \\(I\\) is the indicator function ~wang2021adversarial. \\item Performance Drop Rate (PDR), a new unified metric, effectively assesses the robustness of prompt in \\llms~zhu2023promptbench. PDR quantifies the relative performance degradation after a prompt attack, and the formula is as follows: \\(PDR=1-\\sum_{(x,y)\\in D M\\left [ f(\\left [ A(P),x \\right ] ),y\\right ] }{\\sum_{(x,y)\\in D }M\\left [ f(\\left [ P,x \\right ] ),y\\right ] } \\), where \\(A\\) represents the adversarial attack applied to prompt \\(P\\), and \\(M\\) denotes the evaluation function, which varies across different tasks~zhu2023promptbench. itemize enumerate",

      "content": "The increasingly strengthened capabilities of \\llms have certainly gone beyond standard evaluation metrics on general natural language tasks. Therefore, human evaluation becomes a natural choice in some non-standard cases where automatic evaluation is not suitable. For instance, in open-generation tasks where embedded similarity metrics (such as BERTScore) are not enough, human evaluation is more reliable novikova2017we. While some generation tasks can adopt certain automatic evaluation protocols, human evaluation in these tasks is more favorable as generation can always go better than standard answers. Human evaluation is a way to evaluate the quality and accuracy of model-generated results through human participation. Compared with automatic evaluation, manual evaluation is closer to the actual application scenario and can provide more comprehensive and accurate feedback. In the manual evaluation of \\llms, evaluators (such as experts, researchers, or ordinary users) are usually invited to evaluate the results generated by the model. For example, ziems2023can used the annotations from experts for generation. By human evaluation, liang2022holistic assessed on summarization and disinformation scenarios on 6 models and bang2023multitask evaluated analogical reasoning tasks. bubeck2023sparks did a series of human-crafted tests using GPT-4 and they found that GPT-4 performs close to or even exceeds human performance on multiple tasks. This evaluation requires human evaluators to actually test and compare the performance of the models, not just evaluate the models through automated evaluation metrics. Note that even human evaluations can have high variance and instability, which could be due to cultural and individual differences peng1997validity. In practical applications, these two evaluation methods are considered and weighed in combination with the actual situation. Exploring the human evaluation methods of \\llms requires thoughtful attention to various crucial factors to guarantee the dependability and precision of assessments singhal2023large. Table tb-human provides a concise overview of the essential aspects of human evaluation, including the number of evaluators, evaluation criteria, and evaluator's expertise level. Primarily, the number of evaluators emerges as a crucial factor intricately intertwined with adequate representation and statistical significance. A judiciously chosen number of evaluators contributes to a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of the \\llms under scrutiny, enabling a more reliable extrapolation of the results to a broader context. Furthermore, evaluation criteria are fundamental components of the human assessment process. Expanding upon the principles of the 3H rule (Helpfulness, Honesty, and Harmlessness) askell2021general, we have elaborated them into the following 6 human assessment criteria. These criteria include accuracy, relevance, fluency, transparency, safety, and human alignment. Through the application of these standards, a thorough analysis of LLMs' performance in syntax, semantics, and context is achieved, allowing for a more comprehensive evaluation of the quality of generated text. table*[t!] \\centering Summary of key factors in human evaluation \\textwidth{!}{ tabular{|p{0.28\\linewidth}|m{0.85\\linewidth}|} \\hline Evaluation Criteria & Key Factor \\\\ \\hline\\hline Number of evaluators & Adequate representation belz2006comparing, Statistical significance \\\\ \\hline Evaluation rubrics & Accuracy singhal2023large, Relevance zhong2022towards, Fluency van2019best, Transparency, Safety ji2023beavertails, Human alignment \\\\ \\hline Evaluator's expertise level & Relevant domain expertise olney2023generating, Task familiarity, Methodological training \\\\ \\hline tabular } table* enumerate[leftmargin=2em] \\setlength0em \\item Accuracy singhal2023large stands out as a pivotal criterion that assesses the precision and correctness of the generated text.

This criterion examines how well the text addresses the given context or query, ensuring that the information provided is pertinent and directly applicable. \\item Fluency van2019best assesses the language model's ability to produce content that flows smoothly, maintaining a consistent tone and style. A fluent text is not only grammatically correct but also ensures readability and a seamless user experience. Analysts evaluate how well the model avoids awkward expressions and abrupt shifts in language or topic, contributing to effective communication with users. \\item Transparency delves into the clarity and openness of the language model's decision-making process. It involves assessing how well the model communicates its thought processes, enabling users to understand how and why certain responses are generated. A transparent model provides insights into its inner workings. \\item Safety ji2023beavertails emerges as a critical criterion concerned with the potential harm or unintended consequences arising from the generated text. It examines the language model's ability to avoid producing content that may be inappropriate, offensive, or harmful, ensuring the well-being of users and avoiding misinformation. \\item Human alignment assesses the degree to which the language model's output aligns with human values, preferences, and expectations. It considers the ethical implications of the generated content, ensuring that the language model produces text that respects societal norms and user expectations, promoting a positive interaction with human users. enumerate Lastly, the expertise level of evaluators is a critical consideration, encompassing relevant domain knowledge, task familiarity, and methodological training. Delineating the requisite expertise level for evaluators ensures that they possess the necessary background knowledge to accurately comprehend and assess the domain-specific text generated by \\llms.

      "level": "2",
      "content": "With the rapid development and widespread use of \\llms, the importance of evaluating them in practical applications and research has become crucial. This evaluation process should include not only task-level evaluation but also a deep understanding of the potential risks they pose from a societal perspective. In this section, we summarize existing benchmarks and protocols in \\tablename~tb-llm-eval. First, a shift from objective calculation to human-in-the-loop testing, allowing for greater human feedback during the evaluation process. AdaVision gao2022adaptive, an interactive process for testing vision models, enables users to label a small amount of data for model correctness, which helps users identify and fix coherent failure modes. In AdaTest ribeiro2022adaptive, the user filters test samples by only selecting high-quality tests and organizing them into semantically related topics. Second, a move from static to crowd-sourcing test sets is becoming more common. Tools like DynaBench kiela2021dynabench, DynaBoard ma2021dynaboard, and DynaTask thrush2022dynatask rely on crowdworkers to create and test hard samples. Additionally, DynamicTempLAMA margatina2023dynamic allows for dynamically constructed time-related tests. Third, a shift from a unified to a challenging setting in evaluating machine learning models. While unified settings involve a test set with no preference for any specific task, challenging settings create test sets for specific tasks. Tools like DeepTest tian2018deeptest use seeds to generate input transformations for testing, CheckList ribeiro2020beyond builds test sets based on templates, and AdaFilter phang2021adversarially adversarially constructs tests. However, it is worth noting that AdaFilter may not be entirely fair as it relies on adversarial examples. HELM liang2022holistic evaluates LLMs from different aspects, while the Big-Bench srivastava2022beyond platform is used to design hard tasks for machine learning models to tackle. PromptBench~zhu2023promptbench aims to evaluate the adversarial robustness of \\llms by creating adversarial prompts, which is more challenging and the results demonstrated that current \\llms are not robust to adversarial prompts.",

As we expect \\llms to demonstrate AGI abilities, a comprehensive understanding of the differences between human and AGI capacities becomes crucial in the creation of AGI benchmarks. The prevailing trend seems to conceptualize AGI as a superhuman entity, thereby utilizing cross-disciplinary knowledge from fields such as education, psychology, and social sciences to design innovative benchmarks. Nonetheless, there remains a plethora of unresolved issues. For instance, does it make sense to use human values as a starting point for test construction, or should alternative perspectives be considered?

By treating \\llms as a completely intelligent machine, the evaluations of its multi-modal dimensions should also be considered.

While there are some prior work on robustness evaluation~wang2023robustness,zhu2023promptbench, there are much room for advancement, such as including more diverse evaluation sets, examining more evaluation aspects, and developing more efficient evaluations to generate robustness tasks. Concurrently, the concept and definition of robustness are constantly evolving.

While this facilitates rapid and convenient evaluation within the community, it is unable to accurately assess the evolving abilities of \\llms, given their rapid rate of development. The capabilities of \\llms may enhance over time which cannot be consistently evaluated by existing static benchmarks. On the other hand, as \\llms grow increasingly powerful with larger model sizes and training set sizes, static and public benchmarks are likely to be memorized by \\llms, resulting in potential training data contamination. Therefore, developing dynamic and evolving evaluation systems is the key to providing a fair evaluation of \\llms.",

Following the evaluation, there are undoubtedly conclusions to be drawn regarding performance, robustness, stability, and other factors. A proficient evaluation system should not only offer benchmark results but should also deliver an insightful analysis, recommendations, and guidance for future research and development. For instance, PromptBench~zhu2023promptbench provides not only robustness evaluation results on adversarial prompts but also a comprehensive analysis through attention visualization, elucidating how adversarial texts can result in erroneous responses. The system further offers a word frequency analysis to identify robust and non-robust words in the test sets, thus providing prompt engineering guidance for end users. Subsequent research can leverage these findings to enhance \\llms. Another example is that wang2023exploring first explored the performance of large vision-language models on imbalanced (long-tailed) tasks, which demonstrates the limitation of current large models. Then, they explored different methodologies to enhance the performance on these tasks. In summary, enhancement after evaluation helps to build better \\llms and much can be done in the future.",
