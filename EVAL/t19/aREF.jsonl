However, such success remains modest compared to human intelligence that can learn and perform an unlimited number of tasks. Humans' ability of learning and accumulating knowledge over their lifetime is an essential aspect of their intelligence. Continual machine learning aims at a higher level of machine intelligence through providing the artificial agents with the ability to learn online from a non-stationary and never-ending stream of data. A key component of such a never-ending learning process is to overcome the catastrophic forgetting of previously seen data, a problem that neural networks are well known to suffer from. The work described in this thesis has been dedicated to the investigation of continual learning and solutions to mitigate the forgetting phenomena in neural networks. To approach the continual learning problem, we first assume a task incremental setting where tasks are received one at a time and data from previous tasks are not stored. Since the task incremental setting can't be assumed in all continual learning scenarios, we also study the more general online continual setting. We consider an infinite stream of data drawn from a non-stationary distribution with a supervisory or self-supervisory training signal. The proposed methods in this thesis have tackled important aspects of continual learning. They were evaluated on different benchmarks and over various learning sequences. Advances in the state of the art of continual learning have been shown and challenges for bringing continual learning into application were critically identified."}

Although continual learning is a natural skill for the human brain, it is very challenging for artificial neural networks. An important reason is that, when learning something new, these networks tend to quickly and drastically forget what they had learned before, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Especially in the last decade, continual learning has become an extensively studied topic in deep learning. This book chapter reviews the insights that this field has generated."}

Our primary emphasis is on continual domain-adaptive pretraining, a process designed to equip LLMs with the ability to integrate new information from various domains while retaining previously learned knowledge. Since existing works concentrate mostly on continual fine-tuning for a limited selection of downstream tasks or training domains, we introduce a new benchmark designed to measure the adaptability of LLMs to changing pretraining data landscapes. We further examine the impact of model size on learning efficacy and forgetting, as well as how the progression and similarity of emerging domains affect the knowledge transfer within these models. Our findings uncover several key insights: (i) continual pretraining consistently improves <1.5B models studied in this work and is also superior to domain adaptation, (ii) larger models always achieve better perplexity than smaller ones when continually pretrained on the same corpus, (iii) smaller models are particularly sensitive to continual pretraining, showing the most significant rates of both learning and forgetting, (iv) continual pretraining boosts downstream task performance of GPT-2 family, (v) continual pretraining enables LLMs to specialize better when the sequence of domains shows semantic similarity while randomizing training domains leads to better transfer and final performance otherwise.

Specifically, we propose the Joint Adaptive Re-Parameterization (JARe), integrated with Dynamic Task-related Knowledge Retrieval (DTKR), to enable adaptive adjustment of language models based on specific downstream tasks. This approach leverages the task distribution within the vector space, aiming to achieve a smooth and effortless continual learning process. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on diverse backbones and benchmarks, achieving effective continual learning in both full-set and few-shot scenarios with minimal forgetting. Moreover, while prior research primarily focused on a single task type such as classification, our study goes beyond, with the large language model, i.e., LLaMA-2, to explore the effects across diverse domains and task types, such that a single language model can be decently scaled to broader applications."}

Such a trade-off is referred to as the stability-plasticity dilemma and is a more general and challenging problem for continual learning. However, the inherent conflict between these two concepts makes it seemingly impossible to devise a satisfactory solution to both of them simultaneously. Therefore, we ask, \"is it possible to divide them into two separate problems to conquer them independently?\". To this end, we propose a prompt-tuning-based method termed PromptFusion to enable the decoupling of stability and plasticity. Specifically, PromptFusion consists of a carefully designed \\stab module that deals with catastrophic forgetting and a \\boo module to learn new knowledge concurrently. Furthermore, to address the computational overhead brought by the additional architecture, we propose PromptFusion-Lite which improves PromptFusion by dynamically determining whether to activate both modules for each input image. Extensive experiments show that both PromptFusion and PromptFusion-Lite achieve promising results on popular continual learning datasets for class-incremental and domain-incremental settings. Especially on Split-Imagenet-R, one of the most challenging datasets for class-incremental learning, our method can exceed state-of-the-art prompt-based methods by more than 5\\% in accuracy, with PromptFusion-Lite using 14.8\\% less computational resources than PromptFusion."}

There are however other desirable properties of a CL system, such as the ability to transfer knowledge from previous tasks and to scale memory and compute sub-linearly with the number of tasks. Since most current benchmarks focus only on forgetting using short streams of tasks, we first propose a new suite of benchmarks to probe CL algorithms across these new axes. Finally, we introduce a new modular architecture, whose modules represent atomic skills that can be composed to perform a certain task. Learning a task reduces to figuring out which past modules to re-use, and which new modules to instantiate to solve the current task. Our learning algorithm leverages a task-driven prior over the exponential search space of all possible ways to combine modules, enabling efficient learning on long streams of tasks. Our experiments show that this modular architecture and learning algorithm perform competitively on widely used CL benchmarks while yielding superior performance on the more challenging benchmarks we introduce in this work."}

However, the continual learning aspect of these aligned LLMs has been largely overlooked. Existing continual learning benchmarks lack sufficient challenge for leading aligned LLMs, owing to both their simplicity and the models' potential exposure during instruction tuning. In this paper, we introduce TRACE, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate continual learning in LLMs. TRACE consists of 8 distinct datasets spanning challenging tasks including domain-specific tasks, multilingual capabilities, code generation, and mathematical reasoning. All datasets are standardized into a unified format, allowing for effortless automatic evaluation of LLMs. Our experiments show that after training on TRACE, aligned LLMs exhibit significant declines in both general ability and instruction-following capabilities. For example, the accuracy of llama2-chat 13B on gsm8k dataset declined precipitously from 28.8\\% to 2\\% after training on our datasets. This highlights the challenge of finding a suitable tradeoff between achieving performance on specific tasks while preserving the original prowess of LLMs. Empirical findings suggest that tasks inherently equipped with reasoning paths contribute significantly to preserving certain capabilities of LLMs against potential declines.

RCL integrates task-specific cues with meta-rationales, effectively reducing catastrophic forgetting in LLMs while expediting convergence on novel tasks."}

In parallel, the ability of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to learn across a range of tasks and domains, combining and re-using learned representations where required, is a clear goal of artificial intelligence. This capacity, widely described as continual learning, has become a prolific subfield of research in machine learning. Despite the numerous successes of deep learning in recent years, across domains ranging from image recognition to machine translation, such continual task learning has proved challenging. Neural networks trained on multiple tasks in sequence with stochastic gradient descent often suffer from representational interference, whereby the learned weights for a given task effectively overwrite those of previous tasks in a process termed catastrophic forgetting. This represents a major impediment to the development of more generalised artificial learning systems, capable of accumulating knowledge over time and task space, in a manner analogous to humans.

Research has primarily focused on the incremental classification setting, where new tasks/classes are added at discrete time intervals.

In online continual learning, each incoming small batch of data is first used for testing and then added to the training set, making the problem truly online. Trained models are later evaluated on historical data to assess information retention. We introduce a new benchmark for online continual visual learning that exhibits large scale and natural distribution shifts.

Importantly, our approach can operate in a task-agnostic way, i.e., it does not require task-specific knowledge, as is the case with many existing continual learning algorithms. Due to the general formulation based on generic utility functions, we can apply this optimality principle to a large variety of learning problems, including supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and generative modeling. We demonstrate the competitive performance of our method on continual reinforcement learning and variants of the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets."}

Two notable directions among the recent advances in continual learning with neural networks are ($i$) variational Bayes based regularization by learning priors from previous tasks, and, ($ii$) learning the structure of deep networks to adapt to new tasks. So far, these two approaches have been orthogonal. We present a novel Bayesian approach to continual learning based on learning the structure of deep neural networks, addressing the shortcomings of both these approaches. The proposed model learns the deep structure for each task by learning which weights to be used, and supports inter-task transfer through the overlapping of different sparse subsets of weights learned by different tasks. Experimental results on supervised and unsupervised benchmarks shows that our model performs comparably or better than recent advances in continual learning setting."}

However, in other ways, LLMs are a step backward from traditional special-purpose NLP models; they require extensive computational resources for deployment and can be gated behind APIs. In this paper, we propose Prompt2Model, a general-purpose method that takes a natural language task description like the prompts provided to LLMs, and uses it to train a special-purpose model that is conducive to deployment. This is done through a multi-step process of retrieval of existing datasets and pretrained models, dataset generation using LLMs, and supervised fine-tuning on these retrieved and generated datasets. Over three tasks, we demonstrate that given the same few-shot prompt as input, Prompt2Model trains models that outperform the results of a strong LLM, gpt-3.5-turbo, by an average of 20% while being up to 700 times smaller. We also show that this data can be used to obtain reliable performance estimates of model performance, enabling model developers to assess model reliability before deployment.

However, directly applying LLMs to solve sophisticated problems in specific domains meets many hurdles, caused by the heterogeneity of domain data, the sophistication of domain knowledge, the uniqueness of domain objectives, and the diversity of the constraints (e.g., various social norms, cultural conformity, religious beliefs, and ethical standards in the domain applications). Domain specification techniques are key to make large language models disruptive in many applications. Specifically, to solve these hurdles, there has been a notable increase in research and practices conducted in recent years on the domain specialization of LLMs. This emerging field of study, with its substantial potential for impact, necessitates a comprehensive and systematic review to better summarize and guide ongoing work in this area. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey on domain specification techniques for large language models, an emerging direction critical for large language model applications. First, we propose a systematic taxonomy that categorizes the LLM domain-specialization techniques based on the accessibility to LLMs and summarizes the framework for all the subcategories as well as their relations and differences to each other. Second, we present an extensive taxonomy of critical application domains that can benefit dramatically from specialized LLMs, discussing their practical significance and open challenges.

To reduce the cost without sacrificing performance, previous studies have explored various approaches to harness the potential of Small Language Models (SLMs) as cost-effective alternatives to their larger counterparts. Driven by findings that SLMs and LLMs exhibit complementary strengths in a structured knowledge extraction task, this work presents a novel SLM/LLM routing framework designed to improve computational efficiency and enhance task performance. First, exemplar pools are created to represent the types of contexts where each LM provides a more reliable answer, leveraging a sentence embedding fine-tuned so that context similarity is close to dialogue state similarity. Then, during inference, the k-nearest exemplars to the testing instance are retrieved, and the instance is routed according to majority vote. In dialogue state tracking tasks, the proposed routing framework enhances performance substantially compared to relying solely on LLMs, while reducing the computational costs by over 50%."}

It requires the learner to solve a sequence of $k$ different learning tasks, one after the other, while retaining its aptitude for earlier tasks; the continual learner should scale better than the obvious solution of developing and maintaining a separate learner for each of the $k$ tasks. We embark on a complexity-theoretic study of continual learning in the PAC framework. We make novel uses of communication complexity to establish that any continual learner, even an improper one, needs memory that grows linearly with $k$, strongly suggesting that the problem is intractable. When logarithmically many passes over the learning tasks are allowed, we provide an algorithm based on multiplicative weights update whose memory requirement scales well; we also establish that improper learning is necessary for such performance. We conjecture that these results may lead to new promising approaches to continual learning."}

To avoid performance decrease caused by forgetting, prior studies exploit episodic memory (EM), which stores a subset of the past observed samples while learning from new non-i.i.d. data. Despite the promising results, since CL is often assumed to execute on mobile or IoT devices, the EM size is bounded by the small hardware memory capacity and makes it infeasible to meet the accuracy requirements for real-world applications. Specifically, all prior CL methods discard samples overflowed from the EM and can never retrieve them back for subsequent training steps, incurring loss of information that would exacerbate catastrophic forgetting. We explore a novel hierarchical EM management strategy to address the forgetting issue. In particular, in mobile and IoT devices, real-time data can be stored not just in high-speed RAMs but in internal storage devices as well, which offer significantly larger capacity than the RAMs. Based on this insight, we propose to exploit the abundant storage to preserve past experiences and alleviate the forgetting by allowing CL to efficiently migrate samples between memory and storage without being interfered by the slow access speed of the storage. We call it Carousel Memory (CarM). As CarM is complementary to existing CL methods, we conduct extensive evaluations of our method with seven popular CL methods and show that CarM significantly improves the accuracy of the methods across different settings by large margins in final average accuracy (up to 28.4%) while retaining the same training efficiency."}

This technique is applicable to different families of CL methods such as regularization-based (e.g., the Elastic Weight Consolidation) or the rehearsal-based (e.g., the Gradient Episodic Memory) approaches where episodic memory is needed. Empirical results demonstrate remarkable performance gain (in terms of robustness to forgetting) for methods such as EWC and GEM based on our technique, especially when the memory budget is very limited."}

However, the occupied memory size keeps enlarging along with accumulating seen data. Hereby, we propose a memory-efficient CL method by storing a few samples to achieve good performance.

We conduct extensive experiments on text classification and investigate the effect of training set orders on CL model performance.

Previous work has shown that leveraging memory in the form of a replay buffer can reduce performance degradation on prior tasks. We hypothesize that forgetting can be further reduced when the model is encouraged to remember the \\textit{evidence} for previously made decisions. As a first step towards exploring this hypothesis, we propose a simple novel training paradigm, called Remembering for the Right Reasons (RRR), that additionally stores visual model explanations for each example in the buffer and ensures the model has \"the right reasons\" for its predictions by encouraging its explanations to remain consistent with those used to make decisions at training time. Without this constraint, there is a drift in explanations and increase in forgetting as conventional continual learning algorithms learn new tasks. We demonstrate how RRR can be easily added to any memory or regularization-based approach and results in reduced forgetting, and more importantly, improved model explanations. We have evaluated our approach in the standard and few-shot settings and observed a consistent improvement across various CL approaches using different architectures and techniques to generate model explanations and demonstrated our approach showing a promising connection between explainability and continual learning.

Existing CL approaches often keep a buffer of previously-seen samples, perform knowledge distillation, or use regularization techniques towards this goal. Despite their performance, they still suffer from interference across tasks which leads to catastrophic forgetting. To ameliorate this problem, we propose to only activate and select sparse neurons for learning current and past tasks at any stage. More parameters space and model capacity can thus be reserved for the future tasks. This minimizes the interference between parameters for different tasks. To do so, we propose a Sparse neural Network for Continual Learning (SNCL), which employs variational Bayesian sparsity priors on the activations of the neurons in all layers. Full Experience Replay (FER) provides effective supervision in learning the sparse activations of the neurons in different layers. A loss-aware reservoir-sampling strategy is developed to maintain the memory buffer. The proposed method is agnostic as to the network structures and the task boundaries. Experiments on different datasets show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance for mitigating forgetting."}

However, realistic CL solutions must be shaped not only by metrics of catastrophic forgetting but also by computational efficiency and running time. Here, we introduce a novel neural network architecture inspired by neuromodulation in biological nervous systems to economically and efficiently address catastrophic forgetting and provide new avenues for interpreting learned representations. Neuromodulation is a biological mechanism that has received limited attention in machine learning; it dynamically controls and fine tunes synaptic dynamics in real time to track the demands of different behavioral contexts. Inspired by this, our proposed architecture learns a relatively small set of parameters per task context that \\emph{neuromodulates} the activity of unchanging, randomized weights that transform the input. We show that this approach has strong learning performance per task despite the very small number of learnable parameters. Furthermore, because context vectors are so compact, multiple networks can be stored concurrently with no interference and little spatial footprint, thus completely eliminating catastrophic forgetting and accelerating the training process."}

By modeling a robust Drosophila learning system that actively regulates forgetting with multiple learning modules, here we propose a generic approach that appropriately attenuates old memories in parameter distributions to improve learning plasticity, and accordingly coordinates a multi-learner architecture to ensure solution compatibility. Through extensive theoretical and empirical validation, our approach not only clearly enhances the performance of continual learning, especially over synaptic regularization methods in task-incremental settings, but also potentially advances the understanding of neurological adaptive mechanisms, serving as a novel paradigm to progress AI and BI together."}

However, their substantial computational and memory requirements present challenges, especially for devices with limited DRAM capacity. This paper tackles the challenge of efficiently running LLMs that exceed the available DRAM capacity by storing the model parameters in flash memory, but bringing them on demand to DRAM. Our method involves constructing an inference cost model that takes into account the characteristics of flash memory, guiding us to optimize in two critical areas: reducing the volume of data transferred from flash and reading data in larger, more contiguous chunks. Within this hardware-informed framework, we introduce two principal techniques. First, \"windowing\" strategically reduces data transfer by reusing previously activated neurons, and second, \"row-column bundling\", tailored to the sequential data access strengths of flash memory, increases the size of data chunks read from flash memory. These methods collectively enable running models up to twice the size of the available DRAM, with a 4-5x and 20-25x increase in inference speed compared to naive loading approaches in CPU and GPU, respectively. Our integration of sparsity awareness, context-adaptive loading, and a hardware-oriented design paves the way for effective inference of LLMs on devices with limited memory."}

But insights have suggested an inability to adjust for information or task-solving skills becoming outdated, as their knowledge, stored directly within their parameters, remains static in time. Tool use helps by offloading work to systems that the LLM can access through an interface, but LLMs that use them still must adapt to nonstationary environments for prolonged use, as new tools can emerge and existing tools can change. Nevertheless, tools require less specialized knowledge, therefore we hypothesize they are better suited for continual learning (CL) as they rely less on parametric memory for solving tasks and instead focus on learning when to apply pre-defined tools. To verify this, we develop a synthetic benchmark and follow this by aggregating existing NLP tasks to form a more realistic testing scenario. While we demonstrate scaling model size is not a solution, regardless of tool usage, continual learning techniques can enable tool LLMs to both adapt faster while forgetting less, highlighting their potential as continual learners."}

This review initially explores the issue of domain specificity, where LLMs may struggle to provide precise answers to specialized questions within niche fields.

The knowledge repetition phenomenon reveals that sometimes LLMs might deliver overly mechanized responses, lacking depth and originality. Furthermore, knowledge illusion describes situations where LLMs might provide answers that seem insightful but are actually superficial, while knowledge toxicity focuses on harmful or biased information outputs. These challenges underscore problems in the training data and algorithmic design of LLMs. To address these issues, it's suggested to diversify training data, fine-tune models, enhance transparency and interpretability, and incorporate ethics and fairness training. Future technological trends might lean towards iterative methodologies, multimodal learning, model personalization and customization, and real-time learning and feedback mechanisms.

Conventional learning algorithms for neural networks, however, suffer from catastrophic forgetting (CF), i.e., previously acquired skills are forgotten when a new task is learned. Instead of hand-crafting new algorithms for avoiding CF, we propose Automated Continual Learning (ACL) to train self-referential neural networks to metalearn their own in-context continual (meta)learning algorithms. ACL encodes continual learning (CL) desiderata -- good performance on both old and new tasks -- into its metalearning objectives. Our experiments demonstrate that ACL effectively resolves \"in-context catastrophic forgetting,\" a problem that naive in-context learning algorithms suffer from; ACL-learned algorithms outperform both hand-crafted learning algorithms and popular meta-continual learning methods on the Split-MNIST benchmark in the replay-free setting, and enables continual learning of diverse tasks consisting of multiple standard image classification datasets. We also discuss the current limitations of in-context CL by comparing ACL with state-of-the-art CL methods that leverage pre-trained models. Overall, we bring several novel perspectives into the long-standing problem of CL."}

However, this pursuit overlooks the fundamental disparities between the high-level data perception abilities of artificial and natural intelligence systems. This study questions the Turing Test as a criterion of generally intelligent thought and contends that it is misinterpreted as an attempt to anthropomorphize computer systems. Instead, it emphasizes tacit learning as a cornerstone of general-purpose intelligence, despite its lack of overt interpretability. This abstract form of intelligence necessitates contextual cognitive attributes that are crucial for human-level perception: generalizable experience, moral responsibility, and implicit prioritization. The absence of these features yields undeniable perceptual disparities and constrains the cognitive capacity of artificial systems to effectively contextualize their environments. Additionally, this study establishes that, despite extensive exploration of potential architecture for future systems, little consideration has been given to how such models will continuously absorb and adapt to contextual data. While conventional models may continue to improve in benchmark performance, disregarding these contextual considerations will lead to stagnation in human-like comprehension. Until general intelligence can be abstracted from task-specific domains and systems can learn implicitly from their environments, research standards should instead prioritize the disciplines in which AI thrives."}

For each paradigm, we summarize the goals and dominant approaches for generating local explanations of individual predictions and global explanations of overall model knowledge.

The BabyLM is then pretrained on this restructured dataset in a RoBERTa fashion. In evaluations across 4 benchmarks, our BabyLM outperforms the vanilla RoBERTa in 10 linguistic, NLU, and question-answering tasks by more than 3 points, showing a superior ability to extract contextual information.

GPT-3.5 is an example of an LLM that supports a conversational agent called ChatGPT. In this work, we used a series of novel prompts to determine whether ChatGPT shows heuristics, biases, and other decision effects. We also tested the same prompts on human participants. Across four studies, we found that ChatGPT was influenced by random anchors in making estimates (Anchoring Heuristic, Study 1); it judged the likelihood of two events occurring together to be higher than the likelihood of either event occurring alone, and it was erroneously influenced by salient anecdotal information (Representativeness and Availability Heuristic, Study 2); it found an item to be more efficacious when its features were presented positively rather than negatively - even though both presentations contained identical information (Framing Effect, Study 3); and it valued an owned item more than a newly found item even though the two items were identical (Endowment Effect, Study 4). In each study, human participants showed similar effects. Heuristics and related decision effects in humans are thought to be driven by cognitive and affective processes such as loss aversion and effort reduction. The fact that an LLM - which lacks these processes - also shows such effects invites consideration of the possibility that language may play a role in generating these effects in humans."}

Most prior works concentrate on the techniques of architectures, replay data, regularization, \\etc. However, the category name of each class is largely neglected. Existing methods commonly utilize the one-hot labels and randomly initialize the classifier head. We argue that the scarce semantic information conveyed by the one-hot labels hampers the effective knowledge transfer across tasks. In this paper, we revisit the role of the classifier head within the CL paradigm and replace the classifier with semantic knowledge from pretrained language models (PLMs). Specifically, we use PLMs to generate semantic targets for each class, which are frozen and serve as supervision signals during training. Such targets fully consider the semantic correlation between all classes across tasks. Empirical studies show that our approach mitigates forgetting by alleviating representation drifting and facilitating knowledge transfer across tasks. The proposed method is simple to implement and can seamlessly be plugged into existing methods with negligible adjustments. Extensive experiments based on eleven mainstream baselines demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach to various protocols. For example, under the class-incremental learning setting on ImageNet-100, our method significantly improves the Top-1 accuracy by 3.2\\% to 6.1\\% while reducing the forgetting rate by 2.6\\% to 13.1\\%."}

However, these methods tend to address only one of the challenges, ignoring the potential of aligning the two modules to effectively address catastrophic forgetting and knowledge transfer simultaneously. To this end, we propose a novel Shared Attention Framework (SAPT), to align the PET learning and selection via the Shared Attentive Learning \\& Selection module.

However, while continual learning methods have seen nascent success in the imaging domain, they have been little applied to the multi-variate sequential data characteristic of critical care patient recordings.

{"id": "68", "arxiv": "2007.00487v3", "title": "Continual Learning: Tackling Catastrophic Forgetting in Deep Neural Networks with Replay Processes", "abstract": "Humans learn all their life long. They accumulate knowledge from a sequence of learning experiences and remember the essential concepts without forgetting what they have learned previously. Artificial neural networks struggle to learn similarly. They often rely on data rigorously preprocessed to learn solutions to specific problems such as classification or regression. In particular, they forget their past learning experiences if trained on new ones. Therefore, artificial neural networks are often inept to deal with real-life settings such as an autonomous-robot that has to learn on-line to adapt to new situations and overcome new problems without forgetting its past learning-experiences. Continual learning (CL) is a branch of machine learning addressing this type of problem. Continual algorithms are designed to accumulate and improve knowledge in a curriculum of learning-experiences without forgetting. In this thesis, we propose to explore continual algorithms with replay processes. Replay processes gather together rehearsal methods and generative replay methods. Generative Replay consists of regenerating past learning experiences with a generative model to remember them. Rehearsal consists of saving a core-set of samples from past learning experiences to rehearse them later. The replay processes make possible a compromise between optimizing the current learning objective and the past ones enabling learning without forgetting in sequences of tasks settings. We show that they are very promising methods for continual learning. Notably, they enable the re-evaluation of past data with new knowledge and the confrontation of data from different learning-experiences. We demonstrate their ability to learn continually through unsupervised learning, supervised learning and reinforcement learning tasks."}

The evolution of the learning process is modeled by a sequence of learning experiences where the goal is to be able to learn new skills all along the sequence without forgetting what has been previously learned. Continual learning also aims at the same time at optimizing the memory, the computation power and the speed during the learning process. An important challenge for machine learning is not necessarily finding solutions that work in the real world but rather finding stable algorithms that can learn in real world. Hence, the ideal approach would be tackling the real world in a embodied platform: an autonomous agent. Continual learning would then be effective in an autonomous agent or robot, which would learn autonomously through time about the external world, and incrementally develop a set of complex skills and knowledge. Robotic agents have to learn to adapt and interact with their environment using a continuous stream of observations. Some recent approaches aim at tackling continual learning for robotics, but most recent papers on continual learning only experiment approaches in simulation or with static datasets. Unfortunately, the evaluation of those algorithms does not provide insights on whether their solutions may help continual learning in the context of robotics. This paper aims at reviewing the existing state of the art of continual learning, summarizing existing benchmarks and metrics, and proposing a framework for presenting and evaluating both robotics and non robotics approaches in a way that makes transfer between both fields easier."}

We present a method for using general-purpose large language models to make inferences from scientific datasets of the form usually associated with special-purpose machine learning algorithms. We show that the large language model can augment this \"knowledge\" by synthesizing from the scientific literature. When a conventional machine learning system is augmented with this synthesized and inferred knowledge it can outperform the current state of the art across a range of benchmark tasks for predicting molecular properties. This approach has the further advantage that the large language model can explain the machine learning system's predictions. We anticipate that our framework will open new avenues for AI to accelerate the pace of scientific discovery."}

However, the current models usually learn a generic representation base on the class label on each task and an effective strategy is selected to avoid catastrophic forgetting. We postulate that selecting the related and useful parts only from the knowledge obtained to perform each task is more effective than utilizing the whole knowledge. Based on this fact, in this paper we propose a new framework, named Selecting Related Knowledge for Online Continual Learning (SRKOCL), which incorporates an additional efficient channel attention mechanism to pick the particular related knowledge for every task. Our model also combines experience replay and knowledge distillation to circumvent the catastrophic forgetting. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on different benchmarks and the competitive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SRKOCL is a promised approach against the state-of-the-art."}

Findings include: model performance and calibration both improve with scale, but are poor in absolute terms (and when compared with rater performance); performance is remarkably similar across model classes, though with benefits from sparsity; tasks that improve gradually and predictably commonly involve a large knowledge or memorization component, whereas tasks that exhibit \"breakthrough\" behavior at a critical scale often involve multiple steps or components, or brittle metrics; social bias typically increases with scale in settings with ambiguous context, but this can be improved with prompting."}

A key challenge to this paradigm is the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting. With the increasing popularity and success of pre-trained models in machine learning, we pose the question: What role does pre-training play in lifelong learning, specifically with respect to catastrophic forgetting? We investigate existing methods in the context of large, pre-trained models and evaluate their performance on a variety of text and image classification tasks, including a large-scale study using a novel data set of 15 diverse NLP tasks. Across all settings, we observe that generic pre-training implicitly alleviates the effects of catastrophic forgetting when learning multiple tasks sequentially compared to randomly initialized models. We then further investigate why pre-training alleviates forgetting in this setting. We study this phenomenon by analyzing the loss landscape, finding that pre-trained weights appear to ease forgetting by leading to wider minima. Based on this insight, we propose jointly optimizing for current task loss and loss basin sharpness to explicitly encourage wider basins during sequential fine-tuning. We show that this optimization approach outperforms several state-of-the-art task-sequential continual learning algorithms across multiple settings, occasionally even without retaining a memory that scales in size with the number of tasks."}

Although there has been significant interest in CL, most recent CL approaches in computer vision have focused on convolutional architectures only. However, with the recent success of vision transformers, there is a need to explore their potential for CL. Although there have been some recent CL approaches for vision transformers, they either store training instances of previous tasks or require a task identifier during test time, which can be limiting. This paper proposes a new exemplar-free approach for class/task incremental learning called ConTraCon, which does not require task-id to be explicitly present during inference and avoids the need for storing previous training instances. The proposed approach leverages the transformer architecture and involves re-weighting the key, query, and value weights of the multi-head self-attention layers of a transformer trained on a similar task. The re-weighting is done using convolution, which enables the approach to maintain low parameter requirements per task. Additionally, an image augmentation-based entropic task identification approach is used to predict tasks without requiring task-ids during inference. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms several competitive approaches while requiring fewer parameters."}

The tasks demonstrate a significant boost from 4.5 to 8.5% when compared to tasks fine-tuned on multi-lingual BERT (mBERT). To the best of my knowledge, this is currently the largest clean and diverse Arabic corpus ever collected."}

It is an ideal framework to decrease the amount of supervision in the existing learning algorithms. But for a successful knowledge transfer, the learner needs to remember how to perform previous tasks. One way to endow the learner the ability to perform tasks seen in the past is to store a small memory, dubbed episodic memory, that stores few examples from previous tasks and then to replay these examples when training for future tasks. In this work, we empirically analyze the effectiveness of a very small episodic memory in a CL setup where each training example is only seen once. Surprisingly, across four rather different supervised learning benchmarks adapted to CL, a very simple baseline, that jointly trains on both examples from the current task as well as examples stored in the episodic memory, significantly outperforms specifically designed CL approaches with and without episodic memory. Interestingly, we find that repetitive training on even tiny memories of past tasks does not harm generalization, on the contrary, it improves it, with gains between 7\\% and 17\\% when the memory is populated with a single example per class."}
{"id": "89", "arxiv": "2312.16731v2", "title": "Infinite dSprites for Disentangled Continual Learning: Separating Memory Edits from Generalization", "abstract": "The ability of machine learning systems to learn continually is hindered by catastrophic forgetting, the tendency of neural networks to overwrite previously acquired knowledge when learning a new task. Existing methods mitigate this problem through regularization, parameter isolation, or rehearsal, but they are typically evaluated on benchmarks comprising only a handful of tasks. In contrast, humans are able to learn over long time horizons in dynamic, open-world environments, effortlessly memorizing unfamiliar objects and reliably recognizing them under various transformations. To make progress towards closing this gap, we introduce Infinite dSprites, a parsimonious tool for creating continual classification and disentanglement benchmarks of arbitrary length and with full control over generative factors. We show that over a sufficiently long time horizon, the performance of all major types of continual learning methods deteriorates on this simple benchmark. This result highlights an important and previously overlooked aspect of continual learning: given a finite modelling capacity and an arbitrarily long learning horizon, efficient learning requires memorizing class-specific information and accumulating knowledge about general mechanisms. In a simple setting with direct supervision on the generative factors, we show how learning class-agnostic transformations offers a way to circumvent catastrophic forgetting and improve classification accuracy over time. Our approach sets the stage for continual learning over hundreds of tasks with explicit control over memorization and forgetting, emphasizing open-set classification and one-shot generalization."}
{"id": "90", "arxiv": "2310.08217v1", "title": "TriRE: A Multi-Mechanism Learning Paradigm for Continual Knowledge Retention and Promotion", "abstract": "Continual learning (CL) has remained a persistent challenge for deep neural networks due to catastrophic forgetting (CF) of previously learned tasks. Several techniques such as weight regularization, experience rehearsal, and parameter isolation have been proposed to alleviate CF. Despite their relative success, these research directions have predominantly remained orthogonal and suffer from several shortcomings, while missing out on the advantages of competing strategies. On the contrary, the brain continually learns, accommodates, and transfers knowledge across tasks by simultaneously leveraging several neurophysiological processes, including neurogenesis, active forgetting, neuromodulation, metaplasticity, experience rehearsal, and context-dependent gating, rarely resulting in CF. Inspired by how the brain exploits multiple mechanisms concurrently, we propose TriRE, a novel CL paradigm that encompasses retaining the most prominent neurons for each task, revising and solidifying the extracted knowledge of current and past tasks, and actively promoting less active neurons for subsequent tasks through rewinding and relearning. Across CL settings, TriRE significantly reduces task interference and surpasses different CL approaches considered in isolation."}

Existing continual learning algorithms usually involve a small number of tasks with uniform sizes and may not accurately represent real-world learning scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the performance of continual learning algorithms with a large number of tasks drawn from a task distribution that is long-tail in terms of task sizes. We design one synthetic dataset and two real-world continual learning datasets to evaluate the performance of existing algorithms in such a setting. Moreover, we study an overlooked factor in continual learning, the optimizer states, e.g. first and second moments in the Adam optimizer, and investigate how it can be used to improve continual learning performance. We propose a method that reuses the optimizer states in Adam by maintaining a weighted average of the second moments from previous tasks. We demonstrate that our method, compatible with most existing continual learning algorithms, effectively reduces forgetting with only a small amount of additional computational or memory costs, and provides further improvements on existing continual learning algorithms, particularly in a long-tail task sequence."}
{"id": "92", "arxiv": "1811.11682v2", "title": "Experience Replay for Continual Learning", "abstract": "Continual learning is the problem of learning new tasks or knowledge while protecting old knowledge and ideally generalizing from old experience to learn new tasks faster. Neural networks trained by stochastic gradient descent often degrade on old tasks when trained successively on new tasks with different data distributions. This phenomenon, referred to as catastrophic forgetting, is considered a major hurdle to learning with non-stationary data or sequences of new tasks, and prevents networks from continually accumulating knowledge and skills. We examine this issue in the context of reinforcement learning, in a setting where an agent is exposed to tasks in a sequence. Unlike most other work, we do not provide an explicit indication to the model of task boundaries, which is the most general circumstance for a learning agent exposed to continuous experience. While various methods to counteract catastrophic forgetting have recently been proposed, we explore a straightforward, general, and seemingly overlooked solution - that of using experience replay buffers for all past events - with a mixture of on- and off-policy learning, leveraging behavioral cloning. We show that this strategy can still learn new tasks quickly yet can substantially reduce catastrophic forgetting in both Atari and DMLab domains, even matching the performance of methods that require task identities. When buffer storage is constrained, we confirm that a simple mechanism for randomly discarding data allows a limited size buffer to perform almost as well as an unbounded one."}
{"id": "93", "arxiv": "2205.14495v3", "title": "Task-Agnostic Continual Reinforcement Learning: Gaining Insights and Overcoming Challenges", "abstract": "Continual learning (CL) enables the development of models and agents that learn from a sequence of tasks while addressing the limitations of standard deep learning approaches, such as catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we investigate the factors that contribute to the performance differences between task-agnostic CL and multi-task (MTL) agents. We pose two hypotheses: (1) task-agnostic methods might provide advantages in settings with limited data, computation, or high dimensionality, and (2) faster adaptation may be particularly beneficial in continual learning settings, helping to mitigate the effects of catastrophic forgetting. To investigate these hypotheses, we introduce a replay-based recurrent reinforcement learning (3RL) methodology for task-agnostic CL agents. We assess 3RL on a synthetic task and the Meta-World benchmark, which includes 50 unique manipulation tasks. Our results demonstrate that 3RL outperforms baseline methods and can even surpass its multi-task equivalent in challenging settings with high dimensionality. We also show that the recurrent task-agnostic agent consistently outperforms or matches the performance of its transformer-based counterpart. These findings provide insights into the advantages of task-agnostic CL over task-aware MTL approaches and highlight the potential of task-agnostic methods in resource-constrained, high-dimensional, and multi-task environments."}
{"id": "94", "arxiv": "1907.01929v1", "title": "Rethinking Continual Learning for Autonomous Agents and Robots", "abstract": "Continual learning refers to the ability of a biological or artificial system to seamlessly learn from continuous streams of information while preventing catastrophic forgetting, i.e., a condition in which new incoming information strongly interferes with previously learned representations. Since it is unrealistic to provide artificial agents with all the necessary prior knowledge to effectively operate in real-world conditions, they must exhibit a rich set of learning capabilities enabling them to interact in complex environments with the aim to process and make sense of continuous streams of (often uncertain) information. While the vast majority of continual learning models are designed to alleviate catastrophic forgetting on simplified classification tasks, here we focus on continual learning for autonomous agents and robots required to operate in much more challenging experimental settings. In particular, we discuss well-established biological learning factors such as developmental and curriculum learning, transfer learning, and intrinsic motivation and their computational counterparts for modeling the progressive acquisition of increasingly complex knowledge and skills in a continual fashion."}
{"id": "95", "arxiv": "1906.03744v2", "title": "Generative Continual Concept Learning", "abstract": "After learning a concept, humans are also able to continually generalize their learned concepts to new domains by observing only a few labeled instances without any interference with the past learned knowledge. In contrast, learning concepts efficiently in a continual learning setting remains an open challenge for current Artificial Intelligence algorithms as persistent model retraining is necessary. Inspired by the Parallel Distributed Processing learning and the Complementary Learning Systems theories, we develop a computational model that is able to expand its previously learned concepts efficiently to new domains using a few labeled samples. We couple the new form of a concept to its past learned forms in an embedding space for effective continual learning. Doing so, a generative distribution is learned such that it is shared across the tasks in the embedding space and models the abstract concepts. This procedure enables the model to generate pseudo-data points to replay the past experience to tackle catastrophic forgetting."}
{"id": "96", "arxiv": "2108.10781v2", "title": "Adaptive Explainable Continual Learning Framework for Regression Problems with Focus on Power Forecasts", "abstract": "Compared with traditional deep learning techniques, continual learning enables deep neural networks to learn continually and adaptively. Deep neural networks have to learn new tasks and overcome forgetting the knowledge obtained from the old tasks as the amount of data keeps increasing in applications. In this article, two continual learning scenarios will be proposed to describe the potential challenges in this context. Besides, based on our previous work regarding the CLeaR framework, which is short for continual learning for regression tasks, the work will be further developed to enable models to extend themselves and learn data successively. Research topics are related but not limited to developing continual deep learning algorithms, strategies for non-stationarity detection in data streams, explainable and visualizable artificial intelligence, etc. Moreover, the framework- and algorithm-related hyperparameters should be dynamically updated in applications. Forecasting experiments will be conducted based on power generation and consumption data collected from real-world applications. A series of comprehensive evaluation metrics and visualization tools can help analyze the experimental results. The proposed framework is expected to be generally applied to other constantly changing scenarios."}
