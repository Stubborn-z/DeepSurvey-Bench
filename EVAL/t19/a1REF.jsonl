Unfortunately, training a model on new data usually compromises the performance on past data. In the CL literature, this effect is referred to as catastrophic forgetting (CF). CF has been largely studied, and a plethora of methods have been proposed to address it on short sequences of non-overlapping tasks. In such setups, CF always leads to a quick and significant drop in performance in past tasks. Nevertheless, despite CF, recent work showed that SGD training on linear models accumulates knowledge in a CL regression setup. This phenomenon becomes especially visible when tasks reoccur. We might then wonder if DNNs trained with SGD or any standard gradient-based optimization accumulate knowledge in such a way. Such phenomena would have interesting consequences for applying DNNs to real continual scenarios. Indeed, standard gradient-based optimization methods are significantly less computationally expensive than existing CL algorithms. In this paper, we study the progressive knowledge accumulation (KA) in DNNs trained with gradient-based algorithms in long sequences of tasks with data re-occurrence. We propose a new framework, SCoLe (Scaling Continual Learning), to investigate KA and discover that catastrophic forgetting has a limited effect on DNNs trained with SGD. When trained on long sequences with data sparsely re-occurring, the overall accuracy improves, which might be counter-intuitive given the CF phenomenon. We empirically investigate KA in DNNs under various data occurrence frequencies and propose simple and scalable strategies to increase knowledge accumulation in DNNs."}

CL performance evaluates the model's ability to continually learn and solve new problems with incremental available information over time while retaining previous knowledge. Despite the numerous previous solutions to bypass the catastrophic forgetting (CF) of previously seen tasks during the learning process, most of them still suffer significant forgetting, expensive memory cost, or lack of theoretical understanding of neural networks' conduct while learning new tasks. While the issue that CL performance degrades under different training regimes has been extensively studied empirically, insufficient attention has been paid from a theoretical angle. In this paper, we establish a probabilistic framework to analyze information flow through layers in networks for task sequences and its impact on learning performance. Our objective is to optimize the information preservation between layers while learning new tasks to manage task-specific knowledge passing throughout the layers while maintaining model performance on previous tasks. In particular, we study CL performance's relationship with information flow in the network to answer the question \"How can knowledge of information flow between layers be used to alleviate CF?\". Our analysis provides novel insights of information adaptation within the layers during the incremental task learning process.

In this paper, we show that the impact of CF increases as two tasks increasingly align. We introduce a measure of task similarity called the NTK overlap matrix which is at the core of CF. We analyze common projected gradient algorithms and demonstrate how they mitigate forgetting.

This phenomenon is called catastrophic forgetting. While a line of studies has been proposed with respect to avoiding catastrophic forgetting, most of the methods are based on intuitive insights into the phenomenon, and their performances have been evaluated by numerical experiments using benchmark datasets. Therefore, in this study, we provide the theoretical framework for analyzing catastrophic forgetting by using teacher-student learning. Teacher-student learning is a framework in which we introduce two neural networks: one neural network is a target function in supervised learning, and the other is a learning neural network. To analyze continual learning in the teacher-student framework, we introduce the similarity of the input distribution and the input-output relationship of the target functions as the similarity of tasks. In this theoretical framework, we also provide a qualitative understanding of how a single-layer linear learning neural network forgets tasks. Based on the analysis, we find that the network can avoid catastrophic forgetting when the similarity among input distributions is small and that of the input-output relationship of the target functions is large. The analysis also suggests that a system often exhibits a characteristic phenomenon called overshoot, which means that even if the learning network has once undergone catastrophic forgetting, it is possible that the network may perform reasonably well after further learning of the current task."}

Nevertheless, it remains unclear under what conditions the trained model's performance improves or deteriorates. To deepen our understanding of sequential training, this study provides a theoretical analysis of generalization performance in a solvable case of continual learning. We consider neural networks in the neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime that continually learn target functions from task to task, and investigate the generalization by using an established statistical mechanical analysis of kernel ridge-less regression. We first show characteristic transitions from positive to negative transfer. More similar targets above a specific critical value can achieve positive knowledge transfer for the subsequent task while catastrophic forgetting occurs even with very similar targets. Next, we investigate a variant of continual learning which supposes the same target function in multiple tasks. Even for the same target, the trained model shows some transfer and forgetting depending on the sample size of each task. We can guarantee that the generalization error monotonically decreases from task to task for equal sample sizes while unbalanced sample sizes deteriorate the generalization. We respectively refer to these improvement and deterioration as self-knowledge transfer and forgetting, and empirically confirm them in realistic training of deep neural networks as well."}

While previous works demonstrate strong performance on class-incremental benchmarks, it is not clear whether their success comes from the models being stable, plastic, or a mixture of both. This paper aims to shed light on how effectively recent class-incremental learning algorithms address the stability-plasticity trade-off. We establish analytical tools that measure the stability and plasticity of feature representations, and employ such tools to investigate models trained with various algorithms on large-scale class-incremental benchmarks. Surprisingly, we find that the majority of class-incremental learning algorithms heavily favor stability over plasticity, to the extent that the feature extractor of a model trained on the initial set of classes is no less effective than that of the final incremental model. Our observations not only inspire two simple algorithms that highlight the importance of feature representation analysis, but also suggest that class-incremental learning approaches, in general, should strive for better feature representation learning."}

Since then, the continual learning (CL) community has proposed several solutions aiming to equip the neural network with the ability to learn the current task (plasticity) while still achieving high accuracy on the previous tasks (stability). Despite remarkable improvements, the plasticity-stability trade-off is still far from being solved and its underlying mechanism is poorly understood. In this work, we propose Auxiliary Network Continual Learning (ANCL), a novel method that applies an additional auxiliary network which promotes plasticity to the continually learned model which mainly focuses on stability. More concretely, the proposed framework materializes in a regularizer that naturally interpolates between plasticity and stability, surpassing strong baselines on task incremental and class incremental scenarios. Through extensive analyses on ANCL solutions, we identify some essential principles beneath the stability-plasticity trade-off."}

Concurrently, we judiciously select only a subset of neurons in each layer of the network while training individual tasks to learn the past tasks' feature representation matrix in low-rank. This increases the null space dimension when designing network parameters for subsequent tasks, thereby enhancing the plasticity.

In principle, off-policy RL algorithms can improve sample efficiency by allowing multiple updates per environment interaction. However, these multiple updates often lead the model to overfit to earlier interactions, which is referred to as the loss of plasticity. Our study investigates the underlying causes of this phenomenon by dividing plasticity into two aspects. Input plasticity, which denotes the model's adaptability to changing input data, and label plasticity, which denotes the model's adaptability to evolving input-output relationships. Synthetic experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset reveal that finding smoother minima of loss landscape enhances input plasticity, whereas refined gradient propagation improves label plasticity. Leveraging these findings, we introduce the PLASTIC algorithm, which harmoniously combines techniques to address both concerns. With minimal architectural modifications, PLASTIC achieves competitive performance on benchmarks including Atari-100k and Deepmind Control Suite. This result emphasizes the importance of preserving the model's plasticity to elevate the sample efficiency in RL. The code is available at https://github.com/dojeon-ai/plastic."}

For this purpose, a desirable solution should properly balance memory stability with learning plasticity, and acquire sufficient compatibility to capture the observed distributions. Existing advances mainly focus on preserving memory stability to overcome catastrophic forgetting, but remain difficult to flexibly accommodate incremental changes as biological intelligence (BI) does. By modeling a robust Drosophila learning system that actively regulates forgetting with multiple learning modules, here we propose a generic approach that appropriately attenuates old memories in parameter distributions to improve learning plasticity, and accordingly coordinates a multi-learner architecture to ensure solution compatibility. Through extensive theoretical and empirical validation, our approach not only clearly enhances the performance of continual learning, especially over synaptic regularization methods in task-incremental settings, but also potentially advances the understanding of neurological adaptive mechanisms, serving as a novel paradigm to progress AI and BI together."}

To address the stability-plasticity dilemma in neural networks, we propose a novel method called Entropy-based Stability-Plasticity (ESP). Our approach can decide dynamically how much each model layer should be modified via a plasticity factor. We incorporate branch layers and an entropy-based criterion into the model to find such factor. Our experiments in the domains of natural language and vision show the effectiveness of our approach in leveraging prior knowledge by reducing interference. Also, in some cases, it is possible to freeze layers during training leading to speed up in training."}

However, the design of model architecture remains an open question: In general, learning all tasks with a shared set of parameters suffers from severe interference between tasks; while learning each task with a dedicated parameter subspace is limited by scalability. In this work, we theoretically analyze the generalization errors for learning plasticity and memory stability in continual learning, which can be uniformly upper-bounded by (1) discrepancy between task distributions, (2) flatness of loss landscape and (3) cover of parameter space. Then, inspired by the robust biological learning system that processes sequential experiences with multiple parallel compartments, we propose Cooperation of Small Continual Learners (CoSCL) as a general strategy for continual learning. Specifically, we present an architecture with a fixed number of narrower sub-networks to learn all incremental tasks in parallel, which can naturally reduce the two errors through improving the three components of the upper bound. To strengthen this advantage, we encourage to cooperate these sub-networks by penalizing the difference of predictions made by their feature representations. With a fixed parameter budget, CoSCL can improve a variety of representative continual learning approaches by a large margin (e.g., up to 10.64% on CIFAR-100-SC, 9.33% on CIFAR-100-RS, 11.45% on CUB-200-2011 and 6.72% on Tiny-ImageNet) and achieve the new state-of-the-art performance."}

Often, these algorithms emphasise stability and restrict network updates upon learning new tasks. In many cases, such restrictions come at a cost to the model's plasticity, i.e. the model's ability to adapt to the requirements of a new task. But is all change detrimental? Here, we approach this question by proposing that activation spaces in neural networks can be decomposed into two subspaces: a readout range in which change affects prior tasks and a null space in which change does not alter prior performance. Based on experiments with this novel technique, we show that, indeed, not all activation change is associated with forgetting. Instead, only change in the subspace visible to the readout of a task can lead to decreased stability, while restricting change outside of this subspace is associated only with a loss of plasticity. Analysing various commonly used algorithms, we show that regularisation-based techniques do not fully disentangle the two spaces and, as a result, restrict plasticity more than need be. We expand our results by investigating a linear model in which we can manipulate learning in the two subspaces directly and thus causally link activation changes to stability and plasticity. For hierarchical, nonlinear cases, we present an approximation that enables us to estimate functionally relevant subspaces at every layer of a deep nonlinear network, corroborating our previous insights. Together, this work provides novel means to derive insights into the mechanisms behind stability and plasticity in continual learning and may serve as a diagnostic tool to guide developments of future continual learning algorithms that stabilise inference while allowing maximal space for learning."}

However, they suffer from the \"catastrophic forgetting\" problem when they face a sequence of learning tasks, where they forget the old ones as they learn new tasks. This problem is also highly related to the \"stability-plasticity dilemma\". The more plastic the network, the easier it can learn new tasks, but the faster it also forgets previous ones. Conversely, a stable network cannot learn new tasks as fast as a very plastic network. However, it is more reliable to preserve the knowledge it has learned from the previous tasks. Several solutions have been proposed to overcome the forgetting problem by making the neural network parameters more stable, and some of them have mentioned the significance of dropout in continual learning. However, their relationship has not been sufficiently studied yet. In this paper, we investigate this relationship and show that a stable network with dropout learns a gating mechanism such that for different tasks, different paths of the network are active. Our experiments show that the stability achieved by this implicit gating plays a very critical role in leading to performance comparable to or better than other involved continual learning algorithms to overcome catastrophic forgetting."}

Indeed, in noisy and high-dimensional data, traditional estimates in ambient dimensions approach a fixed entropy and are prohibitively hard to compute. To address these issues, we leverage data geometry to access the underlying manifold and reliably compute these information-theoretic measures. Specifically, we define diffusion spectral entropy (DSE) in neural representations of a dataset as well as diffusion spectral mutual information (DSMI) between different variables representing data. First, we show that they form noise-resistant measures of intrinsic dimensionality and relationship strength in high-dimensional simulated data that outperform classic Shannon entropy, nonparametric estimation, and mutual information neural estimation (MINE). We then study the evolution of representations in classification networks with supervised learning, self-supervision, or overfitting. We observe that (1) DSE of neural representations increases during training; (2) DSMI with the class label increases during generalizable learning but stays stagnant during overfitting; (3) DSMI with the input signal shows differing trends: on MNIST it increases, while on CIFAR-10 and STL-10 it decreases. Finally, we show that DSE can be used to guide better network initialization and that DSMI can be used to predict downstream classification accuracy across 962 models on ImageNet.

As a result, drawing rigorous insights or conclusions from mutual information analysis becomes intricate. In this study, we introduce three novel methods and a few related theorems, aimed at enhancing the rigor of mutual information analysis. Despite their simplicity, these methods can carry substantial utility.

The standard Transfer Entropy (TE) metric follows Granger's causality principle by measuring the Mutual Information (MI) between the past states of a source signal $X$ and the future state of a target signal $Y$ while conditioning on past states of $Y$. Hence, the TE quantifies the improvement, as measured by the log-loss, in the prediction of the target sequence $Y$ that can be accrued when, in addition to the past of $Y$, one also has available past samples from $X$. However, by conditioning on the past of $Y$, the TE also measures information that can be synergistically extracted by observing both the past of $X$ and $Y$, and not solely the past of $X$. Building on a private key agreement formulation, the Intrinsic TE (ITE) aims to discount such synergistic information to quantify the degree to which $X$ is \\emph{individually} predictive of $Y$, independent of $Y$'s past.

Although DE offers a potentially wider range of applications than MI, off-the-shelf DE estimators are either non differentiable, computationally intractable or fail to adapt to changes in the underlying distribution. These drawbacks prevent them from being used as regularizers in neural networks training. To address shortcomings in previously proposed estimators for DE, here we introduce KNIFE, a fully parameterized, differentiable kernel-based estimator of DE. The flexibility of our approach also allows us to construct KNIFE-based estimators for conditional (on either discrete or continuous variables) DE, as well as MI. We empirically validate our method on high-dimensional synthetic data and further apply it to guide the training of neural networks for real-world tasks.

Mutual information provides a natural means of linking variation across scales of a system due to its independence of functional relationship between observables. However, characterizing the manner in which information is distributed across a set of observables is computationally challenging and generally infeasible beyond a handful of measurements. Here we propose a practical and general methodology that uses machine learning to decompose the information contained in a set of measurements by jointly optimizing a lossy compression of each measurement. Guided by the distributed information bottleneck as a learning objective, the information decomposition identifies the variation in the measurements of the system state most relevant to specified macroscale behavior. We focus our analysis on two paradigmatic complex systems: a Boolean circuit and an amorphous material undergoing plastic deformation. In both examples, the large amount of entropy of the system state is decomposed, bit by bit, in terms of what is most related to macroscale behavior. The identification of meaningful variation in data, with the full generality brought by information theory, is made practical for studying the connection between micro- and macroscale structure in complex systems."}

We revisit this problem with a large-scale benchmark and analyze the performance of traditional CL approaches in a compute-constrained setting, where effective memory samples used in training can be implicitly restricted as a consequence of limited computation. We conduct experiments evaluating various CL sampling strategies, distillation losses, and partial fine-tuning on two large-scale datasets, namely ImageNet2K and Continual Google Landmarks V2 in data incremental, class incremental, and time incremental settings. Through extensive experiments amounting to a total of over 1500 GPU-hours, we find that, under compute-constrained setting, traditional CL approaches, with no exception, fail to outperform a simple minimal baseline that samples uniformly from memory.

Although several techniques have achieved learning with no CF, they attain it by letting each task monopolize a sub-network in a shared network, which seriously limits knowledge transfer (KT) and causes over-consumption of the network capacity, i.e., as more tasks are learned, the performance deteriorates. The goal of this paper is threefold: (1) overcoming CF, (2) encouraging KT, and (3) tackling the capacity problem. A novel technique (called SPG) is proposed that soft-masks (partially blocks) parameter updating in training based on the importance of each parameter to old tasks. Each task still uses the full network, i.e., no monopoly of any part of the network by any task, which enables maximum KT and reduction in capacity usage. To our knowledge, this is the first work that soft-masks a model at the parameter-level for continual learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SPG in achieving all three objectives. More notably, it attains significant transfer of knowledge not only among similar tasks (with shared knowledge) but also among dissimilar tasks (with little shared knowledge) while mitigating CF."}

Their propensity to fit the current data distribution to the detriment of the past acquired knowledge leads to the catastrophic forgetting issue. In this work we tackle the problem of Spoken Language Understanding applied to a continual learning setting. We first define a class-incremental scenario for the SLURP dataset. Then, we propose three knowledge distillation (KD) approaches to mitigate forgetting for a sequence-to-sequence transformer model: the first KD method is applied to the encoder output (audio-KD), and the other two work on the decoder output, either directly on the token-level (tok-KD) or on the sequence-level (seq-KD) distributions. We show that the seq-KD substantially improves all the performance metrics, and its combination with the audio-KD further decreases the average WER and enhances the entity prediction metric."}

Existing strategies to alleviate this issue often fix the trade-off between keeping old knowledge (stability) and learning new knowledge (plasticity). However, the stability-plasticity trade-off during continual learning may need to be dynamically changed for better model performance. In this paper, we propose two novel ways to adaptively balance model stability and plasticity. The first one is to adaptively integrate multiple levels of old knowledge and transfer it to each block level in the new model. The second one uses prediction uncertainty of old knowledge to naturally tune the importance of learning new knowledge during model training. To our best knowledge, this is the first time to connect model prediction uncertainty and knowledge distillation for continual learning. In addition, this paper applies a modified CutMix particularly to augment the data for old knowledge, further alleviating the catastrophic forgetting issue.

As such, the key challenge is to transfer and generalize the knowledge learned from one task to other tasks, avoiding forgetting and interference of previous knowledge and improving the overall performance. In this paper, within the continual learning paradigm, we introduce a method that effectively forgets the less useful data samples continuously and allows beneficial information to be kept for training of the subsequent tasks, in an online manner. The method uses statistical leverage score information to measure the importance of the data samples in every task and adopts frequent directions approach to enable a continual or life-long learning property. This effectively maintains a constant training size across all tasks. We first provide mathematical intuition for the method and then demonstrate its effectiveness in avoiding catastrophic forgetting and computational efficiency on continual learning of classification tasks when compared with the existing state-of-the-art techniques."}

Initiated by Learning without Forgetting (LwF), many of the existing works report that knowledge distillation is effective to preserve the previous knowledge, and hence they commonly use a soft label for the old task, namely a knowledge distillation (KD) loss, together with a class label for the new task, namely a cross entropy (CE) loss, to form a composite loss for a single neural network. However, this approach suffers from learning the knowledge by a CE loss as a KD loss often more strongly influences the objective function when they are in a competitive situation within a single network. This could be a critical problem particularly in a class incremental scenario, where the knowledge across tasks as well as within the new task, both of which can only be acquired by a CE loss, is essentially learned due to the existence of a unified classifier. In this paper, we propose a novel continual learning method, called Split-and-Bridge, which can successfully address the above problem by partially splitting a neural network into two partitions for training the new task separated from the old task and re-connecting them for learning the knowledge across tasks. In our thorough experimental analysis, our Split-and-Bridge method outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors in KD-based continual learning."}

However, the current models usually learn a generic representation base on the class label on each task and an effective strategy is selected to avoid catastrophic forgetting. We postulate that selecting the related and useful parts only from the knowledge obtained to perform each task is more effective than utilizing the whole knowledge. Based on this fact, in this paper we propose a new framework, named Selecting Related Knowledge for Online Continual Learning (SRKOCL), which incorporates an additional efficient channel attention mechanism to pick the particular related knowledge for every task. Our model also combines experience replay and knowledge distillation to circumvent the catastrophic forgetting. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on different benchmarks and the competitive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SRKOCL is a promised approach against the state-of-the-art."}

One of its main challenging, catastrophic forgetting, is caused by the neural networks non-optimal ability to learn in non-stationary distributions. In most settings of the current approaches, the agent starts from randomly initialized parameters and is optimized to master the current task regardless of the usefulness of the learned representation for future tasks. Moreover, each of the future tasks uses all the previously learned knowledge although parts of this knowledge might not be helpful for its learning. These cause interference among tasks, especially when the data of previous tasks is not accessible. In this paper, we propose a new method, named Self-Attention Meta-Learner (SAM), which learns a prior knowledge for continual learning that permits learning a sequence of tasks, while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. SAM incorporates an attention mechanism that learns to select the particular relevant representation for each future task. Each task builds a specific representation branch on top of the selected knowledge, avoiding the interference between tasks. We evaluate the proposed method on the Split CIFAR-10/100 and Split MNIST benchmarks in the task agnostic inference. We empirically show that we can achieve a better performance than several state-of-the-art methods for continual learning by building on the top of selected representation learned by SAM. We also show the role of the meta-attention mechanism in boosting informative features corresponding to the input data and identifying the correct target in the task agnostic inference.

One factor that can cause forgetting is the interference between the gradients on losses from different tasks. When the gradients on the current task's loss are in opposing directions to those on previous tasks' losses, updating the model for the current task may cause performance degradation on previous tasks. In this paper, we first identify causes of the above interference, and hypothesize that correlations between data representations are a key factor of interference. We then propose a method for promoting appropriate correlations between arbitrary tasks' data representations (i.e., global alignment) in individual task learning. Specifically, we learn the data representation as a task-specific composition of pre-trained token representations shared across all tasks. Then the correlations between different tasks' data representations are grounded by correlations between pre-trained token representations. We explore different ways to learn such compositions. Without experience replay, our model achieves SOTA performance in continual learning tasks. It also achieves advanced class-incremental performance through task-incremental training."}

In this work, we introduce a novel approach called Cross-Domain Continual Learning (CDCL) that addresses the limitations of being limited to single supervised domains. Our method combines inter- and intra-task cross-attention mechanisms within a compact convolutional network. This integration enables the model to maintain alignment with features from previous tasks, thereby delaying the data drift that may occur between tasks, while performing unsupervised cross-domain (UDA) between related domains. By leveraging an intra-task-specific pseudo-labeling method, we ensure accurate input pairs for both labeled and unlabeled samples, enhancing the learning process. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on public UDA datasets, showcasing its positive performance on cross-domain continual learning challenges.

In this work, we show how to put bounds on forgetting by reformulating continual learning of a model as a continual contraction of its parameter space. To that end, we propose Hyperrectangle Training, a new training methodology where each task is represented by a hyperrectangle in the parameter space, fully contained in the hyperrectangles of the previous tasks. This formulation reduces the NP-hard CL problem back to polynomial time while providing full resilience against forgetting. We validate our claim by developing InterContiNet (Interval Continual Learning) algorithm which leverages interval arithmetic to effectively model parameter regions as hyperrectangles. Through experimental results, we show that our approach performs well in a continual learning setup without storing data from previous tasks."}

Since most current benchmarks focus only on forgetting using short streams of tasks, we first propose a new suite of benchmarks to probe CL algorithms across these new axes. Finally, we introduce a new modular architecture, whose modules represent atomic skills that can be composed to perform a certain task. Learning a task reduces to figuring out which past modules to re-use, and which new modules to instantiate to solve the current task. Our learning algorithm leverages a task-driven prior over the exponential search space of all possible ways to combine modules, enabling efficient learning on long streams of tasks. Our experiments show that this modular architecture and learning algorithm perform competitively on widely used CL benchmarks while yielding superior performance on the more challenging benchmarks we introduce in this work."}

However, 1) the performance for the new continual learner will be degraded without distinguishing the contributions of previously learned tasks; 2) the computational cost will be greatly increased with the number of tasks, since most existing algorithms need to regularize all previous tasks when learning new tasks. To address the above challenges, we propose a self-paced Weight Consolidation (spWC) framework to attain robust continual learning via evaluating the discriminative contributions of previous tasks. To be specific, we develop a self-paced regularization to reflect the priorities of past tasks via measuring difficulty based on key performance indicator (i.e., accuracy). When encountering a new task, all previous tasks are sorted from \"difficult\" to \"easy\" based on the priorities. Then the parameters of the new continual learner will be learned via selectively maintaining the knowledge amongst more difficult past tasks, which could well overcome catastrophic forgetting with less computational cost. We adopt an alternative convex search to iteratively update the model parameters and priority weights in the bi-convex formulation. The proposed spWC framework is plug-and-play, which is applicable to most continual learning algorithms (e.g., EWC, MAS and RCIL) in different directions (e.g., classification and segmentation).

To that end, we develop a biologically-inspired light weight neural network architecture that incorporates local learning and neuromodulation to enable input processing over data streams and online learning. Next, we address the challenge of hyperparameter selection for tasks that are not known in advance by implementing transfer metalearning: using a Bayesian optimization to explore a design space spanning multiple local learning rules and their hyperparameters, we identify high performing configurations in classical single task online learning and we transfer them to continual learning tasks with task-similarity considerations.

To overcome the necessity of using previous tasks' data, in this work, we start with strong representation learning methods that have been shown to be less prone to forgetting. We propose a holistic approach to jointly learn the representation and class prototypes while maintaining the relevance of old class prototypes and their embedded similarities. Specifically, samples are mapped to an embedding space where the representations are learned using a supervised contrastive loss. Class prototypes are evolved continually in the same latent space, enabling learning and prediction at any point. To continually adapt the prototypes without keeping any prior task data, we propose a novel distillation loss that constrains class prototypes to maintain relative similarities as compared to new task data. This method yields state-of-the-art performance in the task-incremental setting, outperforming methods relying on large amounts of data, and provides strong performance in the class-incremental setting without using any stored data points."}

To tackle this, we propose SPACE, an algorithm that enables a network to learn continually and efficiently by partitioning the learnt space into a Core space, that serves as the condensed knowledge base over previously learned tasks, and a Residual space, which is akin to a scratch space for learning the current task. After learning each task, the Residual is analyzed for redundancy, both within itself and with the learnt Core space. A minimal number of extra dimensions required to explain the current task are added to the Core space and the remaining Residual is freed up for learning the next task. We evaluate our algorithm on P-MNIST, CIFAR and a sequence of 8 different datasets, and achieve comparable accuracy to the state-of-the-art methods while overcoming catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, our algorithm is well suited for practical use. The partitioning algorithm analyzes all layers in one shot, ensuring scalability to deeper networks.

However, as keys are learned while tasks progress, the prompting selection strategy is itself subject to catastrophic forgetting, an issue often overlooked by existing approaches. For instance, prompts introduced to accommodate new tasks might end up interfering with previously learned prompts. To make the selection strategy more stable, we leverage a foundation model (CLIP) to select our prompts within a two-level adaptation mechanism. Specifically, the first level leverages a standard textual prompt pool for the CLIP textual encoder, leading to stable class prototypes. The second level, instead, uses these prototypes along with the query image as keys to index a second pool. The retrieved prompts serve to adapt a pre-trained ViT, granting plasticity. In doing so, we also propose a novel residual mechanism to transfer CLIP semantics to the ViT layers. Through extensive analysis on established CL benchmarks, we show that our method significantly outperforms both state-of-the-art CL approaches and the zero-shot CLIP test.

In all settings, the online class incremental learning (OCIL), where incoming samples from data stream can be used only once, is more challenging and can be encountered more frequently in real world. Actually, all continual learning models face a stability-plasticity dilemma, where the stability means the ability to preserve old knowledge while the plasticity denotes the ability to incorporate new knowledge. Although replay-based methods have shown exceptional promise, most of them concentrate on the strategy for updating and retrieving memory to keep stability at the expense of plasticity. To strike a preferable trade-off between stability and plasticity, we propose an Adaptive Focus Shifting algorithm (AFS), which dynamically adjusts focus to ambiguous samples and non-target logits in model learning. Through a deep analysis of the task-recency bias caused by class imbalance, we propose a revised focal loss to mainly keep stability. \\Rt{By utilizing a new weight function, the revised focal loss will pay more attention to current ambiguous samples, which are the potentially valuable samples to make model progress quickly.} To promote plasticity, we introduce a virtual knowledge distillation. By designing a virtual teacher, it assigns more attention to non-target classes, which can surmount overconfidence and encourage model to focus on inter-class information. Extensive experiments on three popular datasets for OCIL have shown the effectiveness of AFS. The code will be available at \\url{https://github.com/czjghost/AFS}."}

We demonstrate three modalities of information flow from time series X to time series Y. Intrinsic information flow exists when the past of X is individually predictive of the present of Y, independent of Y's past; this is most commonly considered information flow. Shared information flow exists when X's past is predictive of Y's present in the same manner as Y's past; this occurs due to synchronization or common driving, for example. Finally, synergistic information flow occurs when neither X's nor Y's pasts are predictive of Y's present on their own, but taken together they are. The two most broadly-employed information-theoretic methods of quantifying information flow---time-delayed mutual information and transfer entropy---are both sensitive to a pair of these modalities: time-delayed mutual information to both intrinsic and shared flow, and transfer entropy to both intrinsic and synergistic flow. To quantify each mode individually we introduce our cryptographic flow ansatz, positing that intrinsic flow is synonymous with secret key agreement between X and Y. Based on this, we employ an easily-computed secret-key-agreement bound---intrinsic mutual information&mdashto quantify the three flow modalities in a variety of systems including asymmetric flows and financial markets."}

In contrast, contemporary machine learning paradigms exhibit limitations in emulating the facets of continual learning (CL). Nonetheless, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) presents promising avenues for realizing CL via interactions with these models. Drawing on Complementary Learning System theory, this paper presents a novel Interactive Continual Learning (ICL) framework, enabled by collaborative interactions among models of various sizes. Specifically, we assign the ViT model as System1 and multimodal LLM as System2. To enable the memory module to deduce tasks from class information and enhance Set2Set retrieval, we propose the Class-Knowledge-Task Multi-Head Attention (CKT-MHA). Additionally, to improve memory retrieval in System1 through enhanced geometric representation, we introduce the CL-vMF mechanism, based on the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution. Meanwhile, we introduce the von Mises-Fisher Outlier Detection and Interaction (vMF-ODI) strategy to identify hard examples, thus enhancing collaboration between System1 and System2 for complex reasoning realization.

Continual Learning (CL) approaches seek to bridge this gap by facilitating the transfer of knowledge to both previous tasks (backward transfer) and future ones (forward transfer) during training. Recent research has shown that self-supervision can produce versatile models that can generalize well to diverse downstream tasks. However, contrastive self-supervised learning (CSSL), a popular self-supervision technique, has limited effectiveness in online CL (OCL). OCL only permits one iteration of the input dataset, and CSSL's low sample efficiency hinders its use on the input data-stream. In this work, we propose Continual Learning via Equivariant Regularization (CLER), an OCL approach that leverages equivariant tasks for self-supervision, avoiding CSSL's limitations. Our method represents the first attempt at combining equivariant knowledge with CL and can be easily integrated with existing OCL methods. Extensive ablations shed light on how equivariant pretext tasks affect the network's information flow and its impact on CL dynamics."}

Recently, continual learning emerged as a rapidly growing area of machine learning where this assumption is relaxed, i.e. where the data distribution is non-stationary and changes over time. This paper represents the state of data distribution by a context variable $c$. A drift in $c$ leads to a data distribution drift. A context drift may change the target distribution, the input distribution, or both. Moreover, distribution drifts might be abrupt or gradual. In continual learning, context drifts may interfere with the learning process and erase previously learned knowledge; thus, continual learning algorithms must include specialized mechanisms to deal with such drifts. In this paper, we aim to identify and categorize different types of context drifts and potential assumptions about them, to better characterize various continual-learning scenarios. Moreover, we propose to use the distribution drift framework to provide more precise definitions of several terms commonly used in the continual learning field."}

However, in real-world scenarios, it can be desirable to train models on a continuous stream of data where multiple classification tasks are presented sequentially. This scenario, known as Continual Learning (CL) poses challenges to standard learning algorithms which struggle to maintain knowledge of old tasks while learning new ones. This stability-plasticity dilemma remains central to CL and multiple metrics have been proposed to adequately measure stability and plasticity separately. However, none considers the increasing difficulty of the classification task, which inherently results in performance loss for any model. In that sense, we analyze some limitations of current metrics and identify the presence of setup-induced forgetting. Therefore, we propose new metrics that account for the task's increasing difficulty. Through experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed metrics can provide new insights into the stability-plasticity trade-off achieved by models in the continual learning environment."}

Despite the progress in the field of continual learning to overcome this forgetting, we show that a set of common state-of-the-art methods still suffers from substantial forgetting upon starting to learn new tasks, except that this forgetting is temporary and followed by a phase of performance recovery. We refer to this intriguing but potentially problematic phenomenon as the stability gap. The stability gap had likely remained under the radar due to standard practice in the field of evaluating continual learning models only after each task. Instead, we establish a framework for continual evaluation that uses per-iteration evaluation and we define a new set of metrics to quantify worst-case performance. Empirically we show that experience replay, constraint-based replay, knowledge-distillation, and parameter regularization methods are all prone to the stability gap; and that the stability gap can be observed in class-, task-, and domain-incremental learning benchmarks. Additionally, a controlled experiment shows that the stability gap increases when tasks are more dissimilar. Finally, by disentangling gradients into plasticity and stability components, we propose a conceptual explanation for the stability gap."}

Deep neural networks are known to lose plasticity over the course of training even in relatively simple learning problems, but the mechanisms driving this phenomenon are still poorly understood. This paper conducts a systematic empirical analysis into plasticity loss, with the goal of understanding the phenomenon mechanistically in order to guide the future development of targeted solutions. We find that loss of plasticity is deeply connected to changes in the curvature of the loss landscape, but that it often occurs in the absence of saturated units. Based on this insight, we identify a number of parameterization and optimization design choices which enable networks to better preserve plasticity over the course of training. We validate the utility of these findings on larger-scale RL benchmarks in the Arcade Learning Environment."}

We introduce a multi-agent formulation in which learners' inner state may change with the teaching interaction, which affects the learning performance in future tasks. In order to teach such learners, we propose an optimal control approach that takes the future performance of the learner after teaching into account. This provides tools for modelling learners having inner states, and machine teaching of meta-learning algorithms. Furthermore, we distinguish manipulative teaching, which can be done by effectively hiding data and also used for indoctrination, from more general education which aims to help the learner become better at generalization and learning in new datasets in the absence of a teacher."}

The goal is to reach an objective by exploiting the temporal relation inherent to the nature's feedback (state). By exploiting this relation, specific learning systems can be designed that perform asymptotically optimal for various applications. However, if the framework of the problem is not stationary, i.e., the nature's state sometimes changes arbitrarily, the past cumulative belief revision done by the system may become useless and the system may fail if it lacks adaptivity. While this adaptivity can be directly implemented in specific cases (e.g., convex optimization), it is mostly not straightforward for general learning tasks. To this end, we propose an efficient optimal mixture framework for general sequential learning systems, which we call the recursive experts for dynamic environments. For this purpose, we design hyper-experts that incorporate the learning systems at our disposal and recursively merge in a specific way to achieve minimax optimal regret bounds up to constant factors. The multiplicative increases in computational complexity from the initial system to our adaptive system are only logarithmic-in-time factors."}

After learning a new task, the active column is distilled into the knowledge base, taking care to protect any previously acquired skills. This cycle of active learning (progression) followed by consolidation (compression) requires no architecture growth, no access to or storing of previous data or tasks, and no task-specific parameters.

CL is essentially a balancing act between being able to learn on the new task (i.e., plasticity) and maintaining the performance on the previously learned concepts (i.e., stability). Intending to address the stability-plasticity trade-off, we propose to perform weight-ensembling of the model parameters of the previous and current tasks. This weighted-ensembled model, which we call Continual Model Averaging (or CoMA), attains high accuracy on the current task by leveraging plasticity, while not deviating too far from the previous weight configuration, ensuring stability. We also propose an improved variant of CoMA, named Continual Fisher-weighted Model Averaging (or CoFiMA), that selectively weighs each parameter in the weights ensemble by leveraging the Fisher information of the weights of the model. Both variants are conceptually simple, easy to implement, and effective in attaining state-of-the-art performance on several standard CL benchmarks.

Existing works usually focus more on the stability and restrict the learning plasticity of later tasks to avoid catastrophic forgetting of learned knowledge. Differently, we propose a continual learning method named Split2MetaFusion which can achieve better trade-off by employing a two-stage strategy: splitting and meta-weighted fusion. In this strategy, a slow model with better stability, and a fast model with better plasticity are learned sequentially at the splitting stage. Then stability and plasticity are both kept by fusing the two models in an adaptive manner. Towards this end, we design an optimizer named Task-Preferred Null Space Projector(TPNSP) to the slow learning process for narrowing the fusion gap. To achieve better model fusion, we further design a Dreaming-Meta-Weighted fusion policy for better maintaining the old and new knowledge simultaneously, which doesn't require to use the previous datasets.

Recently, pretrained vision transformers combined with prompt tuning have shown promise for overcoming catastrophic forgetting in CL. These approaches rely on a pool of learnable prompts which can be inefficient in sharing knowledge across tasks leading to inferior performance. In addition, the lack of fine-grained layer specific prompts does not allow these to fully express the strength of the prompts for CL. We address these limitations by proposing ConvPrompt, a novel convolutional prompt creation mechanism that maintains layer-wise shared embeddings, enabling both layer-specific learning and better concept transfer across tasks. The intelligent use of convolution enables us to maintain a low parameter overhead without compromising performance. We further leverage Large Language Models to generate fine-grained text descriptions of each category which are used to get task similarity and dynamically decide the number of prompts to be learned. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of ConvPrompt and improves SOTA by ~3% with significantly less parameter overhead. We also perform strong ablation over various modules to disentangle the importance of different components."}

Many continual learning (CL) methods have been proposed to overcome catastrophic forgetting which results from non i.i.d data in the sequential learning of neural networks. In this paper we focus on class incremental learning, a challenging CL scenario. For this scenario, generative replay is a promising strategy which generates and replays pseudo data for previous tasks to alleviate catastrophic forgetting. However, it is hard to train a generative model continually for relatively complex data. Based on recently proposed orthogonal weight modification (OWM) algorithm which can approximately keep previously learned feature invariant when learning new tasks, we propose to 1) replay penultimate layer feature with a generative model; 2) leverage a self-supervised auxiliary task to further enhance the stability of feature. Empirical results on several datasets show our method always achieves substantial improvement over powerful OWM while conventional generative replay always results in a negative effect. Meanwhile our method beats several strong baselines including one based on real data storage. In addition, we conduct experiments to study why our method is effective."}

However, a key challenge in this continual learning paradigm is catastrophic forgetting, namely adapting a model to new tasks often leads to severe performance degradation on prior tasks. Current memory-based approaches show their success in alleviating the catastrophic forgetting problem by replaying examples from past tasks when new tasks are learned. However, these methods are infeasible to transfer the structural knowledge from previous tasks i.e., similarities or dissimilarities between different instances. Furthermore, the learning bias between the current and prior tasks is also an urgent problem that should be solved. In this work, we propose a new method, named Online Continual Learning via the Knowledge Invariant and Spread-out Properties (OCLKISP), in which we constrain the evolution of the embedding features via Knowledge Invariant and Spread-out Properties (KISP). Thus, we can further transfer the inter-instance structural knowledge of previous tasks while alleviating the forgetting due to the learning bias. We empirically evaluate our proposed method on four popular benchmarks for continual learning: Split CIFAR 100, Split SVHN, Split CUB200 and Split Tiny-Image-Net.

However, they have overlooked the impact of the knowledge transfer when the dataset in a certain task is biased - namely, when some unintended spurious correlations of the tasks are learned from the biased dataset. In that case, how would they affect learning future tasks or the knowledge already learned from the past tasks? In this work, we carefully design systematic experiments using one synthetic and two real-world datasets to answer the question from our empirical findings. Specifically, we first show through two-task CL experiments that standard CL methods, which are unaware of dataset bias, can transfer biases from one task to another, both forward and backward, and this transfer is exacerbated depending on whether the CL methods focus on the stability or the plasticity. We then present that the bias transfer also exists and even accumulate in longer sequences of tasks. Finally, we propose a simple, yet strong plug-in method for debiasing-aware continual learning, dubbed as Group-class Balanced Greedy Sampling (BGS). As a result, we show that our BGS can always reduce the bias of a CL model, with a slight loss of CL performance at most."}

Firstly, newly collected novelties from the data stream in applications could contain anomalies that are meaningless for continual learning. Instead of viewing them as a new task for updating, we have to filter out such anomalies to reduce the disturbance of extremely high-entropy data for the progression of convergence. Secondly, fewer efforts have been put into research regarding the explainability of continual learning, which leads to a lack of transparency and credibility of the updated neural networks. Elaborated explanations about the process and result of continual learning can help experts in judgment and making decisions.

Continual learning also aims at the same time at optimizing the memory, the computation power and the speed during the learning process. An important challenge for machine learning is not necessarily finding solutions that work in the real world but rather finding stable algorithms that can learn in real world. Hence, the ideal approach would be tackling the real world in a embodied platform: an autonomous agent. Continual learning would then be effective in an autonomous agent or robot, which would learn autonomously through time about the external world, and incrementally develop a set of complex skills and knowledge. Robotic agents have to learn to adapt and interact with their environment using a continuous stream of observations. Some recent approaches aim at tackling continual learning for robotics, but most recent papers on continual learning only experiment approaches in simulation or with static datasets. Unfortunately, the evaluation of those algorithms does not provide insights on whether their solutions may help continual learning in the context of robotics.

By contrast, real-world sequential decision-making problems typically involve a complex and time-varying interdependence of system variables, requiring a rich and flexible representation of information structure. In this paper, we formalize a novel reinforcement learning model which explicitly represents the information structure. We then use this model to carry out an information-structural analysis of the statistical hardness of general sequential decision-making problems, obtaining a characterization via a graph-theoretic quantity of the DAG representation of the information structure. We prove an upper bound on the sample complexity of learning a general sequential decision-making problem in terms of its information structure by exhibiting an algorithm achieving the upper bound.

Our models show promising results on sequential and associative memory tasks, illustrating their ability to robustly form and retain memories. In the meantime, these models can cope with many challenging few-shot learning problems. Comparing different plasticity rules under the same framework shows that Hebbian plasticity is well-suited for several memory and associative learning tasks; however, it is outperformed by gradient-based plasticity on few-shot regression tasks which require the model to infer the underlying mapping.

This progress inspires our exploration into a new paradigm for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs): a Plasticity-Driven Learning Framework (PDLF).

Instead, our approach delves into the heart of synaptic behavior, prioritizing the learning of plasticity rules themselves. This shift in focus from weight adjustment to mastering the intricacies of synaptic change offers a more flexible and dynamic pathway for neural networks to evolve and adapt. Our PDLF does not merely adapt existing concepts of functional and Presynaptic-Dependent Plasticity but redefines them, aligning closely with the dynamic and adaptive nature of biological learning. This reorientation enhances key cognitive abilities in artificial intelligence systems, such as working memory and multitasking capabilities, and demonstrates superior adaptability in complex, real-world scenarios. Moreover, our framework sheds light on the intricate relationships between various forms of plasticity and cognitive functions, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of the brain's learning mechanisms.

In other words, neural circuits must solve a credit assignment problem to appropriately assign responsibility for global network behavior to individual circuit components. Furthermore, biological constraints demand that plasticity rules are spatially and temporally local; that is, synaptic changes can depend only on variables accessible to the pre- and postsynaptic neurons. While artificial intelligence offers a computational solution for credit assignment, namely backpropagation through time (BPTT), this solution is wildly biologically implausible. It requires both nonlocal computations and unlimited memory capacity, as any synaptic change is a complicated function of the entire history of network activity. Similar nonlocality issues plague other approaches such as FORCE (Sussillo et al. 2009). Overall, we are still missing a model for learning in recurrent circuits that both works computationally and uses only local updates. Leveraging recent advances in machine learning on approximating gradients for BPTT, we derive biologically plausible plasticity rules that enable recurrent networks to accurately learn long-term dependencies in sequential data. The solution takes the form of neurons with segregated voltage compartments, with several synaptic sub-populations that have different functional properties. The network operates in distinct phases during which each synaptic sub-population is updated by its own local plasticity rule. Our results provide new insights into the potential roles of segregated dendritic compartments, branch-specific inhibition, and global circuit phases in learning."}
{"id": "84", "arxiv": "1402.0710v5", "title": "Short-term plasticity as cause-effect hypothesis testing in distal reward learning", "abstract": "Asynchrony, overlaps and delays in sensory-motor signals introduce ambiguity as to which stimuli, actions, and rewards are causally related. Only the repetition of reward episodes helps distinguish true cause-effect relationships from coincidental occurrences. In the model proposed here, a novel plasticity rule employs short and long-term changes to evaluate hypotheses on cause-effect relationships. Transient weights represent hypotheses that are consolidated in long-term memory only when they consistently predict or cause future rewards. The main objective of the model is to preserve existing network topologies when learning with ambiguous information flows. Learning is also improved by biasing the exploration of the stimulus-response space towards actions that in the past occurred before rewards. The model indicates under which conditions beliefs can be consolidated in long-term memory, it suggests a solution to the plasticity-stability dilemma, and proposes an interpretation of the role of short-term plasticity."}
{"id": "85", "arxiv": "2303.14705v1", "title": "Control of synaptic plasticity via the fusion of reinforcement learning and unsupervised learning in neural networks", "abstract": "The brain can learn to execute a wide variety of tasks quickly and efficiently. Nevertheless, most of the mechanisms that enable us to learn are unclear or incredibly complicated. Recently, considerable efforts have been made in neuroscience and artificial intelligence to understand and model the structure and mechanisms behind the amazing learning capability of the brain. However, in the current understanding of cognitive neuroscience, it is widely accepted that synaptic plasticity plays an essential role in our amazing learning capability. This mechanism is also known as the Credit Assignment Problem (CAP) and is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The observations of neuroscientists clearly confirm the role of two important mechanisms including the error feedback system and unsupervised learning in synaptic plasticity. With this inspiration, a new learning rule is proposed via the fusion of reinforcement learning (RL) and unsupervised learning (UL). In the proposed computational model, the nonlinear optimal control theory is used to resemble the error feedback loop systems and project the output error to neurons membrane potential (neurons state), and an unsupervised learning rule based on neurons membrane potential or neurons activity are utilized to simulate synaptic plasticity dynamics to ensure that the output error is minimized."}
{"id": "86", "arxiv": "2111.11964v1", "title": "Reviewing continual learning from the perspective of human-level intelligence", "abstract": "Humans' continual learning (CL) ability is closely related to Stability Versus Plasticity Dilemma that describes how humans achieve ongoing learning capacity and preservation for learned information. The notion of CL has always been present in artificial intelligence (AI) since its births. This paper proposes a comprehensive review of CL. Different from previous reviews that mainly focus on the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon in CL, this paper surveys CL from a more macroscopic perspective based on the Stability Versus Plasticity mechanism. Analogous to biological counterpart, \"smart\" AI agents are supposed to i) remember previously learned information (information retrospection); ii) infer on new information continuously (information prospection:); iii) transfer useful information (information transfer), to achieve high-level CL. According to the taxonomy, evaluation metrics, algorithms, applications as well as some open issues are then introduced. Our main contributions concern i) rechecking CL from the level of artificial general intelligence; ii) providing a detailed and extensive overview on CL topics; iii) presenting some novel ideas on the potential development of CL."}
