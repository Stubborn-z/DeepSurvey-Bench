Yet, the progression of medical LLMs faces obstacles such as complex training requirements, rigorous evaluation demands, and the dominance of proprietary models that restrict academic exploration. Transparent, comprehensive access to LLM resources is essential for advancing the field, fostering reproducibility, and encouraging innovation in healthcare AI. We present Hippocrates, an open-source LLM framework specifically developed for the medical domain. In stark contrast to previous efforts, it offers unrestricted access to its training datasets, codebase, checkpoints, and evaluation protocols. This open approach is designed to stimulate collaborative research, allowing the community to build upon, refine, and rigorously evaluate medical LLMs within a transparent ecosystem. Also, we introduce Hippo, a family of 7B models tailored for the medical domain, fine-tuned from Mistral and LLaMA2 through continual pre-training, instruction tuning, and reinforcement learning from human and AI feedback. Our models outperform existing open medical LLMs models by a large-margin, even surpassing models with 70B parameters.

{"title": "Structured code representations enable data-efficient adaptation of code language models", "abstract": "Current language models tailored for code tasks often adopt the pre-training-then-fine-tuning paradigm from natural language processing, modeling source code as plain text. This approach, however, overlooks the unambiguous structures inherent in programming languages. In this work, we explore data-efficient adaptation of pre-trained code models by further pre-training and fine-tuning them with program structures. Specifically, we represent programs as parse trees -- also known as concrete syntax trees (CSTs) -- and adapt pre-trained models on serialized CSTs. Although the models that we adapt have been pre-trained only on the surface form of programs, we find that a small amount of continual pre-training and fine-tuning on CSTs without changing the model architecture yields improvements over the baseline approach across various code tasks. The improvements are found to be particularly significant when there are limited training examples, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating program structures with plain-text representation even when working with backbone models that have not been pre-trained with structures.", "arxivid": "2401.10716v1"}
{"title": "Memory aware synapses: Learning what (not) to forget", "abstract": "Humans can learn in a continuous manner. Old rarely utilized knowledge can be overwritten by new incoming information while important, frequently used knowledge is prevented from being erased. In artificial learning systems, lifelong learning so far has focused mainly on accumulating knowledge over tasks and overcoming catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we argue that, given the limited model capacity and the unlimited new information to be learned, knowledge has to be preserved or erased selectively. Inspired by neuroplasticity, we propose a novel approach for lifelong learning, coined Memory Aware Synapses (MAS). It computes the importance of the parameters of a neural network in an unsupervised and online manner. Given a new sample which is fed to the network, MAS accumulates an importance measure for each parameter of the network, based on how sensitive the predicted output function is to a change in this parameter. When learning a new task, changes to important parameters can then be penalized, effectively preventing important knowledge related to previous tasks from being overwritten. Further, we show an interesting connection between a local version of our method and Hebb's rule,which is a model for the learning process in the brain. We test our method on a sequence of object recognition tasks and on the challenging problem of learning an embedding for predicting $ $ triplets. We show state-of-the-art performance and, for the first time, the ability to adapt the importance of the parameters based on unlabeled data towards what the network needs (not) to forget, which may vary depending on test conditions.", "arxivid": "1711.09601v4"}

New entities,issues, and ideas continuously emerge, while the semantics of the existing conversation topics gradually shift. In recent years, pre-trained language models like BERT greatly improved the state-of-the-art for a large spectrum of content understanding tasks.Therefore, in this paper, we aim to study how these language models can be adapted to better handle continuously evolving web content.In our study, we first analyze the evolution of 2013 - 2019 Twitter data, and unequivocally confirm that a BERT model trained on past tweets would heavily deteriorate when directly applied to data from later years. Then, we investigate two possible sources of the deterioration: the semantic shift of existing tokens and the sub-optimal or failed understanding of new tokens. To this end, we both explore two different vocabulary composition methods, as well as propose three sampling methods which help in efficient incremental training for BERT-like models.

This has resulted recognition of datasets as meaningful research contributions in and of themselves.Reddit, the so called “front page of the Internet,” in particular has been the subject of numerous scientific studies.

{"title": "A theory of learning from different domains", "abstract": "Discriminative learning methods for classification perform well when training and test data are drawn from the same distribution. Often, however, we have plentiful labeled training data from a source domain but wish to learn a classifier which performs well on a target domain with a different distribution and little or no labeled training data. In this work we investigate two questions. First, under what conditions can a classifier trained from source data be expected to perform well on target data? Second, given a small amount of labeled target data, how should we combine it during training with the large amount of labeled source data to achieve the lowest target error at test time?We address the first question by bounding a classifier’s target error in terms of its source error and the divergence between the two domains. We give a classifier-induced divergence measure that can be estimated from finite, unlabeled samples from the domains. Under the assumption that there exists some hypothesis that performs well in both domains, we show that this quantity together with the empirical source error characterize the target error of a source-trained classifier.We answer the second question by bounding the target error of a model which minimizes a convex combination of the empirical source and target errors. Previous theoretical work has considered minimizing just the source error, just the target error, or weighting instances from the two domains equally. We show how to choose the optimal combination of source and target error as a function of the divergence, the sample sizes of both domains, and the complexity of the hypothesis class. The resulting bound generalizes the previously studied cases and is always at least as tight as a bound which considers minimizing only the target error or an equal weighting of source and target errors.", "arxivid": ""}

{"title": "Transformers for supervised online continual learning", "abstract": "Transformers have become the dominant architecture for sequence modeling tasks such as natural language processing or audio processing, and they are now even considered for tasks that are not naturally sequential such as image classification. Their ability to attend to and to process a set of tokens as context enables them to develop in-context few-shot learning abilities. However, their potential for online continual learning remains relatively unexplored. In online continual learning, a model must adapt to a non-stationary stream of data, minimizing the cumulative nextstep prediction loss. We focus on the supervised online continual learning setting, where we learn a predictor $x_t \\rightarrow y_t$ for a sequence of examples $(x_t, y_t)$. Inspired by the in-context learning capabilities of transformers and their connection to meta-learning, we propose a method that leverages these strengths for online continual learning. Our approach explicitly conditions a transformer on recent observations, while at the same time online training it with stochastic gradient descent, following the procedure introduced with Transformer-XL. We incorporate replay to maintain the benefits of multi-epoch training while adhering to the sequential protocol.

While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic.

{"title": "Take the bull by the horns: Hard sample-reweighted continual training improves llm generalization", "abstract": "In the rapidly advancing arena of large language models (LLMs), a key challenge is to enhance their capabilities amid a looming shortage of high-quality training data. Our study starts from an empirical strategy for the light continual training of LLMs using their original pre-training data sets, with a specific focus on selective retention of samples that incur moderately high losses. These samples are deemed informative and beneficial for model refinement, contrasting with the highest-loss samples, which would be discarded due to their correlation with data noise and complexity. We then formalize this strategy into a principled framework of Instance-Reweighted Distributionally Robust Optimization (IR-DRO). IR-DRO is designed to dynamically prioritize the training focus on informative samples through an instance reweighting mechanism, streamlined by a closed-form solution for straightforward integration into established training protocols. Through rigorous experimentation with various models and datasets, our findings indicate that our sample-targeted methods significantly improve LLM performance across multiple benchmarks, in both continual pre-training and instruction tuning scenarios.

{"title": "Parameterizing context: Unleashing the power of parameter-efficient fine-tuning and in-context tuning for continual table semantic parsing", "abstract": "Continual table semantic parsing aims to train a parser on a sequence of tasks, where each task requires the parser to translate natural language into SQL based on task-specific tables but only offers limited training examples. Conventional methods tend to suffer from overfitting with limited supervision, as well as catastrophic forgetting due to parameter updates. Despite recent advancements that partially alleviate these issues through semi-supervised data augmentation and retention of a few past examples, the performance is still limited by the volume of unsupervised data and stored examples. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel method integrating \\textit{parameter-efficient fine-tuning} (PEFT) and \\textit{in-context tuning} (ICT) for training a continual table semantic parser. Initially, we present a task-adaptive PEFT framework capable of fully circumventing catastrophic forgetting, which is achieved by freezing the pre-trained model backbone and fine-tuning small-scale prompts. Building on this, we propose a teacher-student framework-based solution. The teacher addresses the few-shot problem using ICT, which procures contextual information by demonstrating a few training examples. In turn, the student leverages the proposed PEFT framework to learn from the teacher's output distribution, and subsequently compresses and saves the contextual information to the prompts, eliminating the need to store any training examples. Experimental evaluations on two benchmarks affirm the superiority of our method over prevalent few-shot and continual learning baselines across various metrics.", "arxivid": "2310.04801v1"}

We introduce an evaluation protocol for Continual Pre-Training which monitors forgetting against a Forgetting Control dataset not present in the continual stream. We disentangle the impact on forgetting of 3 main factors: the input modality (NLP, Vision), the architecture type (Transformer, ResNet) and the pre-training protocol (supervised, self-supervised). Moreover, we propose a Sample-Efficient Pre-training method (SEP) that speeds up the pre-training phase. We show that the pre-training protocol is the most important factor accounting for forgetting. Surprisingly, we discovered that self-supervised continual pre-training in both NLP and Vision is sufficient to mitigate forgetting without the use of any Continual Learning strategy. Other factors, like model depth, input modality and architecture type are not as crucial.", "arxivid": "2205.09357v1"}

We present KnowledgeEditor, a method which can be used to edit this knowledge and, thus, fix ‘bugs’ or unexpected predictions without the need for expensive re-training or fine-tuning. Besides being computationally efficient, KnowledgeEditordoes not require any modifications in LM pre-training (e.g., the use of meta-learning). In our approach, we train a hyper-network with constrained optimization to modify a fact without affecting the rest of the knowledge; the trained hyper-network is then used to predict the weight update at test time. We show KnowledgeEditor’s efficacy with two popular architectures and knowledge-intensive tasks: i) a BERT model fine-tuned for fact-checking, and ii) a sequence-to-sequence BART model for question answering. With our method, changing a prediction on the specific wording of a query tends to result in a consistent change in predictions also for its paraphrases. We show that this can be further encouraged by exploiting (e.g., automatically-generated) paraphrases during training. Interestingly, our hyper-network can be regarded as a ‘probe’ revealing which components need to be changed to manipulate factual knowledge; our analysis shows that the updates tend to be concentrated on a small subset of components.

We propose to counter these language priors for the task of VQA and make vision (the V in VQA) matter! Specifically, we balance the popular VQA dataset (Antol et al., in: ICCV, 2015) by collecting complementary images such that every question in our balanced dataset is associated with not just a single image, but rather a pair of similar images that result in two different answers to the question. Our dataset is by construction more balanced than the original VQA dataset and has approximately twice the number of image-question pairs. Our complete balanced dataset is publicly available at http://visualqa.org/ as part of the 2nd iteration of the VQA Dataset and Challenge (VQA v2.0). We further benchmark a number of state-of-art VQA models on our balanced dataset.

A much cheaper and more efficient solution would be to enable the continual pre-training of these models, i.e. updating pre-trained models with new data instead of re-training them from scratch. However, the distribution shift induced by novel data typically results in degraded performance on past data. Taking a step towards efficient continual pre-training, in this work, we examine the effect of different warm-up strategies. Our hypothesis is that the learning rate must be re-increased to improve compute efficiency when training on a new dataset. We study the warmup phase of models pre-trained on the Pile (upstream data, 300B tokens) as we continue to pre-train on SlimPajama (downstream data, 297B tokens), following a linear warmup and cosine decay schedule. We conduct all experiments on the Pythia 410M language model architecture and evaluate performance through validation perplexity. We experiment with different pre-training checkpoints, various maximum learning rates, and various warmup lengths. Our results show that while rewarming models first increases the loss on upstream and downstream data, in the longer run it improves the downstream performance, outperforming models trained from scratch$\\unicode{x2013}$even for a large downstream dataset.", "arxivid": "2308.04014v2"}

VizWiz consists of over 31,000 visual questions originating from blind people who each took a picture using a mobile phone and recorded a spoken question about it, together with 10 crowdsourced answers per visual question. VizWiz differs from the many existing VQA datasets because (1) images are captured by blind photographers and so are often poor quality, (2) questions are spoken and so are more conversational, and (3) often visual questions cannot be answered. Evaluation of modern algorithms for answering visual questions and deciding if a visual question is answerable reveals that VizWiz is a challenging dataset.

Extensive experiments with autoregressive transformer LMs (up to 1.3B parameters) show that DEMix layers reduce test-time perplexity (especially for out-of-domain data), increase training efficiency, and enable rapid adaptation. Mixing experts during inference, using a parameter-free weighted ensemble, enables better generalization to heterogeneous or unseen domains. We also show it is possible to add experts to adapt to new domains without forgetting older ones, and remove experts to restrict access to unwanted domains.

{"title": "Does localization inform editing? surprising differences in causality-based localization vs", "abstract": "Language models learn a great quantity of factual information during pretraining, and recent work localizes this information to specific model weights like mid-layer MLP weights. In this paper, we find that we can change how a fact is stored in a model by editing weights that are in a different location than where existing methods suggest that the fact is stored. This is surprising because we would expect that localizing facts to specific model parameters would tell us where to manipulate knowledge in models, and this assumption has motivated past work on model editing methods. Specifically, we show that localization conclusions from representation denoising (also known as Causal Tracing) do not provide any insight into which model MLP layer would be best to edit in order to override an existing stored fact with a new one. This finding raises questions about how past work relies on Causal Tracing to select which model layers to edit. Next, we consider several variants of the editing problem, including erasing and amplifying facts. For one of our editing problems, editing performance does relate to localization results from representation denoising, but we find that which layer we edit is a far better predictor of performance. Our results suggest, counterintuitively, that better mechanistic understanding of how pretrained language models work may not always translate to insights about how to best change their behavior.

Instead of always re-training LMMs when new tasks arrive, continual learning offers flexibility for models to continually and efficiently exploit the evolving data. This work aims to explore the following two questions: 1) Do LMMs still suffer from catastrophic forgetting in continual instruction tuning? 2) Are the existing three classes of continual learning methods still applicable to the continual instruction tuning of LMMs? An extensive study is conducted to address the above questions. First, we establish the first benchmark in this setting and reveal that catastrophic forgetting is still observed when continually instruction-tuning LMMs. However, the multi-task joint instruction tuning can facilitate the model's continual learning ability and mitigate forgetting. Second, we integrate and adapt classic continual learning methods to our context, demonstrating the efficacy of data replay and model expansion strategies across diverse scenarios. In contrast, regularization-based methods only perform well on models that have been jointly instruction-tuned on multiple tasks.

{"title": "Instruction-tuned language models are better knowledge learners", "abstract": "In order for large language model (LLM)-based assistants to effectively adapt to evolving information needs, it must be possible to update their factual knowledge through continued training on new data. The standard recipe for doing so involves continued pre-training on new documents followed by instruction-tuning on question-answer (QA) pairs. However, we find that LLMs trained with this recipe struggle to answer questions, even though the perplexity of documents is minimized. We found that QA pairs are generally straightforward, while documents are more complex, weaving many factual statements together in an intricate manner. Therefore, we hypothesize that it is beneficial to expose LLMs to QA pairs before continued pre-training on documents so that the process of encoding knowledge from complex documents takes into account how this knowledge is accessed through questions. Based on this, we propose pre-instruction-tuning (PIT), a method that instruction-tunes on questions prior to training on documents. This contrasts with standard instruction-tuning, which learns how to extract knowledge after training on documents. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that pre-instruction-tuning significantly enhances the ability of LLMs to absorb knowledge from new documents, outperforming standard instruction-tuning by 17.8%.", "arxivid": "2402.12847v2"}
{"title": "What will my model forget? forecasting forgotten examples in language model refinement", "abstract": "Language models deployed in the wild make errors. However, simply updating the model with the corrected error instances causes catastrophic forgetting -- the updated model makes errors on instances learned during the instruction tuning or upstream training phase. Randomly replaying upstream data yields unsatisfactory performance and often comes with high variance and poor controllability. To this end, we try to forecast upstream examples that will be forgotten due to a model update for improved controllability of the replay process and interpretability. We train forecasting models given a collection of online learned examples and corresponding forgotten upstream pre-training examples. We propose a partially interpretable forecasting model based on the observation that changes in pre-softmax logit scores of pretraining examples resemble that of online learned examples, which performs decently on BART but fails on T5 models. We further show a black-box classifier based on inner products of example representations achieves better forecasting performance over a series of setups. Finally, we show that we reduce forgetting of upstream pretraining examples by replaying examples that are forecasted to be forgotten, demonstrating the practical utility of forecasting example forgetting.", "arxivid": "2402.01865v3"}

However, when deployed in the real world, a PTLM-based model must deal with data distributions that deviates from what the PTLM was initially trained on. In this paper, we study a lifelong language model pretraining challenge where a PTLM is continually updated so as to adapt to emerging data. Over a domain-incremental research paper stream and a chronologically-ordered tweet stream, we incrementally pretrain a PTLM with different continual learning algorithms, and keep track of the downstream task performance (after fine-tuning). We evaluate PTLM’s ability to adapt to new corpora while retaining learned knowledge in earlier corpora. Our experiments show distillation-based approaches to be most effective in retaining downstream performance in earlier domains. The algorithms also improve knowledge transfer, allowing models to achieve better downstream performance over latest data, and improve temporal generalization when distribution gaps exist between training and evaluation because of time.

However, most existing techniques focus only on overcoming CF and have no mechanism to encourage KT, and thus do not do well in KT. Although several papers have tried to deal with both CF and KT, our experiments show that they suffer from serious CF when the tasks do not have much shared knowledge. Another observation is that most current CL methods do not use pre-trained models, but it has been shown that such models can significantly improve the end task performance. For example, in natural language processing, fine-tuning a BERT-like pre-trained language model is one of the most effective approaches. However, for CL, this approach suffers from serious CF.

We present a multi-hop reasoning dataset, Question Answering via Sentence Composition (QASC), that requires retrieving facts from a large corpus and composing them to answer a multiple-choice question. QASC is the first dataset to offer two desirable properties: (a) the facts to be composed are annotated in a large corpus, and (b) the decomposition into these facts is not evident from the question itself. The latter makes retrieval challenging as the system must introduce new concepts or relations in order to discover potential decompositions. Further, the reasoning model must then learn to identify valid compositions of these retrieved facts using common-sense reasoning. To help address these challenges, we provide annotation for supporting facts as well as their composition. Guided by these annotations, we present a two-step approach to mitigate the retrieval challenges. We use other multiple-choice datasets as additional training data to strengthen the reasoning model.

{"title": "A theoretical study on solving continual learning", "abstract": "Continual learning (CL) learns a sequence of tasks incrementally. There are two popular CL settings, class incremental learning (CIL) and task incremental learning (TIL). A major challenge of CL is catastrophic forgetting (CF). While a number of techniques are already available to effectively overcome CF for TIL, CIL remains to be highly challenging. So far, little theoretical study has been done to provide a principled guidance on how to solve the CIL problem. This paper performs such a study. It first shows that probabilistically, the CIL problem can be decomposed into two sub-problems: Within-task Prediction (WP) and Task-id Prediction (TP). It further proves that TP is correlated with out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, which connects CIL and OOD detection. The key conclusion of this study is that regardless of whether WP and TP or OOD detection are defined explicitly or implicitly by a CIL algorithm, good WP and good TP or OOD detection are necessary and sufficient for good CIL performances. Additionally, TIL is simply WP. Based on the theoretical result, new CIL methods are also designed, which outperform strong baselines in both CIL and TIL settings by a large margin.", "arxivid": "2211.02633v1"}
{"title": "Overcoming catastrophic forgetting in neural networks", "abstract": "Significance Deep neural networks are currently the most successful machine-learning technique for solving a variety of tasks, including language translation, image classification, and image generation. One weakness of such models is that, unlike humans, they are unable to learn multiple tasks sequentially. In this work we propose a practical solution to train such models sequentially by protecting the weights important for previous tasks. This approach, inspired by synaptic consolidation in neuroscience, enables state of the art results on multiple reinforcement learning problems experienced sequentially. The ability to learn tasks in a sequential fashion is crucial to the development of artificial intelligence. Until now neural networks have not been capable of this and it has been widely thought that catastrophic forgetting is an inevitable feature of connectionist models. We show that it is possible to overcome this limitation and train networks that can maintain expertise on tasks that they have not experienced for a long time. Our approach remembers old tasks by selectively slowing down learning on the weights important for those tasks.

{"title": "Mind the gap: Assessing temporal generalization in neural language models", "abstract": "Our world is open-ended, non-stationary, and constantly evolving; thus what we talk about and how we talk about it change over time. This inherent dynamic nature of language contrasts with the current static language modelling paradigm, which trains and evaluates models on utterances from overlapping time periods. Despite impressive recent progress, we demonstrate that Transformer-XL language models perform worse in the realistic setup of predicting future utterances from beyond their training period, and that model performance becomes increasingly worse with time. We find that, while increasing model size alone -- a key driver behind recent progress -- does not solve this problem, having models that continually update their knowledge with new information can indeed mitigate this performance degradation over time. Hence, given the compilation of ever-larger language modelling datasets, combined with the growing list of language-model-based NLP applications that require up-to-date factual knowledge about the world, we argue that now is the right time to rethink the static way in which we currently train and evaluate our language models, and develop adaptive language models that can remain up-to-date with respect to our ever-changing and non-stationary world.

{"title": "Large language models with controllable working memory", "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have led to a series of breakthroughs in natural language processing (NLP), owing to their excellent understanding and generation abilities. Remarkably, what further sets these models apart is the massive amounts of world knowledge they internalize during pretraining. While many downstream applications provide the model with an informational context to aid its performance on the underlying task, how the model's world knowledge interacts with the factual information presented in the context remains under explored. As a desirable behavior, an LLM should give precedence to the context whenever it contains task-relevant information that conflicts with the model's memorized knowledge. This enables model predictions to be grounded in the context, which can then be used to update or correct specific model predictions without frequent retraining. By contrast, when the context is irrelevant to the task, the model should ignore it and fall back on its internal knowledge. In this paper, we undertake a first joint study of the aforementioned two properties, namely controllability and robustness, in the context of LLMs. We demonstrate that state-of-the-art T5 and PaLM (both pretrained and finetuned) could exhibit poor controllability and robustness, which do not scale with increasing model size.

Whereas, despite various techniques to mitigate forgetting, they are often at odds with the RLHF performance, leading to a trade-off between alignment performance and forgetting mitigation, leading to an alignment-forgetting trade-off. In this paper we show that model averaging, which simply interpolates between pre and post RLHF model weights, surprisingly achieves the most strongest alignment-forgetting Pareto front among a wide range of competing methods. To understand its effectiveness, we offer theoretical insights into model averaging, revealing that it enhances performance Pareto front by increasing feature diversity on the layers where tasks share overlapped feature spaces. Empirical evidence corroborates our analysis by showing the benefits of averaging low-level transformer layers.

{"title": "Few-shot parameter-efficient fine-tuning is better and cheaper than in-context learning", "abstract": "Few-shot in-context learning (ICL) enables pre-trained language models to perform a previously-unseen task without any gradient-based training by feeding a small number of training examples as part of the input. ICL incurs substantial computational, memory, and storage costs because it involves processing all of the training examples every time a prediction is made. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) (e.g. adapter modules, prompt tuning, sparse update methods, etc.) offers an alternative paradigm where a small set of parameters are trained to enable a model to perform the new task. In this paper, we rigorously compare few-shot ICL and PEFT and demonstrate that the latter offers better accuracy as well as dramatically lower computational costs. Along the way, we introduce a new PEFT method called (IA)$^3$ that scales activations by learned vectors, attaining stronger performance while only introducing a relatively tiny amount of new parameters. We also propose a simple recipe based on the T0 model called T-Few that can be applied to new tasks without task-specific tuning or modifications. We validate the effectiveness of T-Few on completely unseen tasks by applying it to the RAFT benchmark, attaining super-human performance for the first time and outperforming the state-of-the-art by 6% absolute.

An embodied agent operating in a complex environment subject to frequent and unpredictable changes is required to learn and adapt continuously. In the context of object recognition, for example, a robot should be able to learn (without forgetting) objects of never before seen classes as well as improving its recognition capabilities as new instances of already known classes are discovered. Ideally, continual learning should be triggered by the availability of short videos of single objects and performed on-line on on-board hardware with fine-grained updates. In this paper, we introduce a novel continual learning protocol based on the CORe50 benchmark and propose two rehearsal-free continual learning techniques, CWR* and AR1*, that can learn effectively even in the challenging case of nearly 400 small non-i.i.d. incremental batches.

{"title": "Ibcl: Zero-shot model generation for task trade-offs in continual learning", "abstract": "Algorithms that balance the stability-plasticity trade-off are well studied in the Continual Learning literature. However, only a few focus on obtaining models for specified trade-off preferences. When solving the problem of continual learning under specific trade-offs (CLuST), state-of-the-art techniques leverage rehearsal-based learning, which requires retraining when a model corresponding to a new trade-off preference is requested. This is inefficient, since there potentially exists a significant number of different trade-offs, and a large number of models may be requested. As a response, we propose Imprecise Bayesian Continual Learning (IBCL), an algorithm that tackles CLuST efficiently. IBCL replaces retraining with a constant-time convex combination. Given a new task, IBCL (1) updates the knowledge base as a convex hull of model parameter distributions, and (2) generates one Pareto-optimal model per given trade-off via convex combination without additional training. That is, obtaining models corresponding to specified trade-offs via IBCL is zero-shot. Experiments whose baselines are current CLuST algorithms show that IBCL improves classification by at most 44% on average per task accuracy, and by 45% on peak per task accuracy while maintaining a near-zero to positive backward transfer, with memory overheads converging to constants. In addition, its training overhead, measured by the number of batch updates, remains constant at every task, regardless of the number of preferences requested. IBCL also improves multi-objective reinforcement learning tasks by maintaining the same Pareto front hypervolume, while significantly reducing the training cost.

Specifically, we design three metrics, including overall generality destruction (GD), syntactic knowledge forgetting (SynF), and semantic knowledge forgetting (SemF), to measure the evolution of general knowledge in continual learning. With extensive experiments, we find that the generality is destructed in various pre-trained LMs, and syntactic and semantic knowledge is forgotten through continual learning.

{"title": "An empirical study of catastrophic forgetting in large language models during continual fine-tuning", "abstract": "Catastrophic forgetting (CF) is a phenomenon that occurs in machine learning when a model forgets previously learned information while acquiring new knowledge for achieving satisfactory performance in downstream tasks. As large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance, it is intriguing to investigate whether CF exists during the continual instruction tuning of LLMs. This study empirically evaluates the forgetting phenomenon in LLMs’ knowledge during continual instruction tuning from the perspectives of domain knowledge, reasoning, and reading comprehension. The experiments reveal that catastrophic forgetting is generally observed in LLMs ranging from 1 b to 7 b parameters. Surprisingly, as the model scale increases, the severity of forgetting intensifies in such a model scale range, which may result from the much more significant initial performance in the larger LLM. The finding is also observed by the experiment of Qwen-2.5-Inst from 3 B to 14 B. Comparing the decoder-only model BLOOMZ with the encoder-decoder model mT0, BLOOMZ exhibits less forgetting and retains more knowledge. Interestingly, we also observe that LLMs can mitigate language biases, such as gender bias, during continual fine-tuning.

However, just as humans, even the largest artificial neural networks (ANNs) make mistakes, and once-correct predictions can become invalid as the world progresses in time. Augmenting datasets with samples that account for mistakes or up-to-date information has become a common workaround in practical applications. However, the well-known phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting poses a challenge in achieving precise changes in the implicitly memorized knowledge of neural network parameters, often requiring a full model retraining to achieve desired behaviors. That is expensive, unreliable, and incompatible with the current trend of large self-supervised pretraining, making it necessary to find more efficient and effective methods for adapting neural network models to changing data. To address this need, knowledge editing (KE) is emerging as a novel area of research that aims to enable reliable, data-efficient, and fast changes to a pretrained target model, without affecting model behaviors on previously learned tasks. In this survey, we provide a brief review of this recent artificial intelligence field of research. We first introduce the problem of editing neural networks, formalize it in a common framework and differentiate it from more notorious branches of research such as continuous learning.

This capacity, widely described as continual learning, has become a prolific subfield of research in machine learning. Despite the numerous successes of deep learning in recent years, across domains ranging from image recognition to machine translation, such continual task learning has proved challenging. Neural networks trained on multiple tasks in sequence with stochastic gradient descent often suffer from representational interference, whereby the learned weights for a given task effectively overwrite those of previous tasks in a process termed catastrophic forgetting.

A key challenge to this paradigm is the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting. With the increasing popularity and success of pre-trained models in machine learning, we pose the question: What role does pre-training play in lifelong learning, specifically with respect to catastrophic forgetting? We investigate existing methods in the context of large, pre-trained models and evaluate their performance on a variety of text and image classification tasks, including a large-scale study using a novel data set of 15 diverse NLP tasks. Across all settings, we observe that generic pre-training implicitly alleviates the effects of catastrophic forgetting when learning multiple tasks sequentially compared to randomly initialized models. We then further investigate why pre-training alleviates forgetting in this setting. We study this phenomenon by analyzing the loss landscape, finding that pre-trained weights appear to ease forgetting by leading to wider minima. Based on this insight, we propose jointly optimizing for current task loss and loss basin sharpness to explicitly encourage wider basins during sequential fine-tuning. We show that this optimization approach outperforms several state-of-the-art task-sequential continual learning algorithms across multiple settings, occasionally even without retaining a memory that scales in size with the number of tasks.", "arxivid": "2112.09153v2"}

{"title": "Fast model editing at scale", "abstract": "While large pre-trained models have enabled impressive results on a variety of downstream tasks, the largest existing models still make errors, and even accurate predictions may become outdated over time. Because detecting all such failures at training time is impossible, enabling both developers and end users of such models to correct inaccurate outputs while leaving the model otherwise intact is desirable. However, the distributed, black-box nature of the representations learned by large neural networks makes producing such targeted edits difficult. If presented with only a single problematic input and new desired output, fine-tuning approaches tend to overfit; other editing algorithms are either computationally infeasible or simply ineffective when applied to very large models. To enable easy post-hoc editing at scale, we propose Model Editor Networks using Gradient Decomposition (MEND), a collection of small auxiliary editing networks that use a single desired input-output pair to make fast, local edits to a pre-trained model's behavior. MEND learns to transform the gradient obtained by standard fine-tuning, using a low-rank decomposition of the gradient to make the parameterization of this transformation tractable. MEND can be trained on a single GPU in less than a day even for 10 billion+ parameter models; once trained MEND enables rapid application of new edits to the pre-trained model.

Model editors make local updates to the behavior of base (pre-trained) models to inject updated knowledge or correct undesirable behaviors. Existing model editors have shown promise, but also suffer from insufficient expressiveness: they struggle to accurately model an edit's intended scope (examples affected by the edit), leading to inaccurate predictions for test inputs loosely related to the edit, and they often fail altogether after many edits. As a higher-capacity alternative, we propose Semi-Parametric Editing with a Retrieval-Augmented Counterfactual Model (SERAC), which stores edits in an explicit memory and learns to reason over them to modulate the base model's predictions as needed. To enable more rigorous evaluation of model editors, we introduce three challenging language model editing problems based on question answering, fact-checking, and dialogue generation. We find that only SERAC achieves high performance on all three problems, consistently outperforming existing approaches to model editing by a significant margin.

In this work, we explore for the first time whether this attractive property of in-context instruction learning can be extended to a scenario in which tasks are fed to the target PLM in a sequential manner. The primary objective of so-called lifelong in-context instruction learning is to improve the target PLM’s instance- and task-level generalization performance as it observes more tasks. DynaInst, the proposed method to lifelong in-context instruction learning, achieves noticeable improvements in both types of generalization, nearly reaching the upper bound performance obtained through joint training.", "arxivid": ""}

Recently, a promising Deep Learning (DL) based solution, called Copilot, has been proposed by OpenAI and Microsoft as an industrial product. Although some studies evaluate the correctness of Copilot solutions and report its issues, more empirical evaluations are necessary to understand how developers can benefit from it effectively. In this paper, we study the capabilities of Copilot in two different programming tasks: (i) generating (and reproducing) correct and efficient solutions for fundamental algorithmic problems, and (ii) comparing Copilot's proposed solutions with those of human programmers on a set of programming tasks. For the former, we assess the performance and functionality of Copilot in solving selected fundamental problems in computer science, like sorting and implementing data structures. In the latter, a dataset of programming problems with human-provided solutions is used. The results show that Copilot is capable of providing solutions for almost all fundamental algorithmic problems, however, some solutions are buggy and non-reproducible. Moreover, Copilot has some difficulties in combining multiple methods to generate a solution. Comparing Copilot to humans, our results show that the correct ratio of humans' solutions is greater than Copilot's suggestions, while the buggy solutions generated by Copilot require less effort to be repaired.", "arxivid": "2206.15331v2"}

We seek to introduce new datasets and methods to address the recommendation justification task. In terms of data, we first propose an ‘extractive’ approach to identify review segments which justify users’ intentions; this approach is then used to distantly label massive review corpora and construct large-scale personalized recommendation justification datasets. In terms of generation, we are able to design two personalized generation models with this data: (1) a reference-based Seq2Seq model with aspect-planning which can generate justifications covering different aspects, and (2) an aspect-conditional masked language model which can generate diverse justifications based on templates extracted from justification histories.

{"title": "Revisiting catastrophic forgetting in class incremental learning", "abstract": "Although the concept of catastrophic forgetting is straightforward, there is a lack of study on its causes. In this paper, we systematically explore and reveal three causes for catastrophic forgetting in Class Incremental Learning(CIL). From the perspective of representation learning,(i) intra-phase forgetting happens when the learner fails to correctly align the same-phase data as training proceeds and (ii) inter-phase confusion happens when the learner confuses the current-phase data with the previous-phase. From the task-specific point of view, the CIL model suffers from the problem of (iii) classifier deviation. After investigating existing strategies, we observe that there is a lack of study on how to prevent the inter-phase confusion. To initiate the research on this specific issue, we propose a simple yet effective framework, Contrastive Class Concentration for CIL (C4IL). Our framework leverages the class concentration effect of contrastive learning, yielding a representation distribution with better intra-class compactibility and inter-class separability. Empirically, we observe that C4IL significantly lowers the probability of inter-phase confusion and as a result improves the performance on multiple CIL settings of multiple datasets.", "arxivid": "2107.12308v5"}

However, these samples are always collected continuously in real scenarios. This paper discusses the feasibility of continual CLIP training using streaming data. Unlike continual learning based on self-supervised learning methods for pure images, which is empirically robust against catastrophic forgetting, CLIP's performance degeneration in the continual setting is significant and non-neglectable. By analyzing the changes in the model's representation space during continual CLIP training from a spatial geometry perspective, we explore and summarize these spatial variations as Spatial Disorder (SD), which can be divided into Intra-modal Rotation and Inter-modal Deviation. Moreover, we empirically and theoretically demonstrate how SD leads to a performance decline for CLIP on cross-modal retrieval tasks. To alleviate SD, we propose a new continual vision-language representation learning framework Mod-X: Maintain off-diagonal information-matriX. By selectively aligning the off-diagonal information distribution of contrastive matrices, the Mod-X improves the capability of the multi-modal model by maintaining the multi-modal representation space alignment on the old data domain during continuously fitting the new training data domain.

For example, large language models can generate outputs that are untruthful, toxic, or simply not helpful to the user. In other words, these models are not aligned with their users. In this paper, we show an avenue for aligning language models with user intent on a wide range of tasks by fine-tuning with human feedback. Starting with a set of labeler-written prompts and prompts submitted through the OpenAI API, we collect a dataset of labeler demonstrations of the desired model behavior, which we use to fine-tune GPT-3 using supervised learning. We then collect a dataset of rankings of model outputs, which we use to further fine-tune this supervised model using reinforcement learning from human feedback. We call the resulting models InstructGPT. In human evaluations on our prompt distribution, outputs from the 1.3B parameter InstructGPT model are preferred to outputs from the 175B GPT-3, despite having 100x fewer parameters. Moreover, InstructGPT models show improvements in truthfulness and reductions in toxic output generation while having minimal performance regressions on public NLP datasets.

In particular, most mainstream Code-LMs have been pre-trained on source code files alone. In this work, we investigate the prospect of leveraging readily available compiler intermediate representations (IR) - shared across programming languages - to improve the multilingual capabilities of Code-LMs and facilitate cross-lingual transfer.

Language models have many advantages over structured knowledge bases: they require no schema engineering, allow practitioners to query about an open class of relations, are easy to extend to more data, and require no human supervision to train. We present an in-depth analysis of the relational knowledge already present (without fine-tuning) in a wide range of state-of-the-art pretrained language models.

We revisit this problem with a large-scale benchmark and analyze the performance of traditional CL approaches in a compute-constrained setting, where effective memory samples used in training can be implicitly restricted as a consequence of limited computation. We conduct experiments evaluating various CL sampling strategies, distillation losses, and partial fine-tuning on two large-scale datasets, namely ImageNet2K and Continual Google Landmarks V2 in data incremental, class incremental, and time incremental settings. Through extensive experiments amounting to a total of over 1500 GPU-hours, we find that, under compute-constrained setting, traditional CL approaches, with no exception, fail to outperform a simple minimal baseline that samples uniformly from memory. Our conclusions are consistent in a different number of stream time steps, e.g., 20 to 200, and under several computational budgets.

In this work, we define this more challenging yet practical problem as Lifelong Few-shot Language Learning (LFLL) and propose a unified framework for it based on prompt tuning of T5. Our framework called LFPT5 takes full advantage of PT's strong few-shot learning ability, and simultaneously trains the model as a task solver and a data generator. Before learning a new domain of the same task type, LFPT5 generates pseudo (labeled) samples of previously learned domains, and later gets trained on those samples to alleviate forgetting of previous knowledge as it learns the new domain. In addition, a KL divergence loss is minimized to achieve label consistency between the previous and the current model. While adapting to a new task type, LFPT5 includes and tunes additional prompt embeddings for the new task. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that LFPT5 can be applied to various different types of tasks and significantly outperform previous methods in different LFLL settings.", "arxivid": "2110.07298v3"}

We bring this issue to the forefront and contend that proper algorithms for recycling outdated adapted weights should be developed. To this end, we formulate the task of recyclable tuning for continual pre-training. In pilot studies, we find that after continual pre-training, the upgraded PLM remains compatible with the outdated adapted weights to some extent. Motivated by this finding, we analyze the connection between continually pre-trained PLMs from two novel aspects, i.e., mode connectivity, and functional similarity. Based on the corresponding findings, we propose both an initialization-based method and a distillation-based method for our task.

We demonstrate that the simple pre-training task of predicting which caption goes with which image is an efficient and scalable way to learn SOTA image representations from scratch on a dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the internet. After pre-training, natural language is used to reference learned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling zero-shot transfer of the model to downstream tasks. We study the performance of this approach by benchmarking on over 30 different existing computer vision datasets, spanning tasks such as OCR, action recognition in videos, geo-localization, and many types of fine-grained object classification.

{"title": "Llm-prop: Predicting physical and electronic properties of crystalline solids from their text descriptions", "abstract": "The prediction of crystal properties plays a crucial role in the crystal design process. Current methods for predicting crystal properties focus on modeling crystal structures using graph neural networks (GNNs). Although GNNs are powerful, accurately modeling the complex interactions between atoms and molecules within a crystal remains a challenge. Surprisingly, predicting crystal properties from crystal text descriptions is understudied, despite the rich information and expressiveness that text data offer. One of the main reasons is the lack of publicly available data for this task. In this paper, we develop and make public a benchmark dataset (called TextEdge) that contains text descriptions of crystal structures with their properties. We then propose LLM-Prop, a method that leverages the general-purpose learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to predict the physical and electronic properties of crystals from their text descriptions. LLM-Prop outperforms the current state-of-the-art GNN-based crystal property predictor by about 4% in predicting band gap, 3% in classifying whether the band gap is direct or indirect, and 66% in predicting unit cell volume. LLM-Prop also outperforms a finetuned MatBERT, a domain-specific pre-trained BERT model, despite having 3 times fewer parameters.

It has been hypothesized that this is a consequence of implicit multitask learning in language models' pretraining (Radford et al., 2019). Can zero-shot generalization instead be directly induced by explicit multitask learning? To test this question at scale, we develop a system for easily mapping any natural language tasks into a human-readable prompted form.

{"title": "Error sensitivity modulation based experience replay: Mitigating abrupt representation drift in continual learning", "abstract": "Humans excel at lifelong learning, as the brain has evolved to be robust to distribution shifts and noise in our ever-changing environment. Deep neural networks (DNNs), however, exhibit catastrophic forgetting and the learned representations drift drastically as they encounter a new task. This alludes to a different error-based learning mechanism in the brain. Unlike DNNs, where learning scales linearly with the magnitude of the error, the sensitivity to errors in the brain decreases as a function of their magnitude. To this end, we propose \\textit{ESMER} which employs a principled mechanism to modulate error sensitivity in a dual-memory rehearsal-based system. Concretely, it maintains a memory of past errors and uses it to modify the learning dynamics so that the model learns more from small consistent errors compared to large sudden errors. We also propose \\textit{Error-Sensitive Reservoir Sampling} to maintain episodic memory, which leverages the error history to pre-select low-loss samples as candidates for the buffer, which are better suited for retaining information. Empirical results show that ESMER effectively reduces forgetting and abrupt drift in representations at the task boundary by gradually adapting to the new task while consolidating knowledge. Remarkably, it also enables the model to learn under high levels of label noise, which is ubiquitous in real-world data streams.", "arxivid": "2302.11344v1"}

We collect over 100,000 Wikipedia revisions that modify an underlying fact, and leverage these revisions, together with additional synthetically constructed ones, to create a total of over 400,000 claim-evidence pairs. Unlike previous resources, the examples in VitaminC are contrastive, i.e., they contain evidence pairs that are nearly identical in language and content, with the exception that one supports a given claim while the other does not. We show that training using this design increases robustness—improving accuracy by 10% on adversarial fact verification and 6% on adversarial natural language inference (NLI).

In spite of the limited success of Continual Learning, we show that Fine-tuned Language Models can be continual learners.We empirically investigate the reason for this success and conclude that Continual Learning emerges from self-supervision pre-training. Our resulting model Continual-T0 (CT0) is able to learn 8 new diverse language generation tasks, while still maintaining good performance on previous tasks, spanning in total of 70 datasets.

In this work, we address these challenges and finally realize the promise of conditional computation, achieving greater than 1000x improvements in model capacity with only minor losses in computational efficiency on modern GPU clusters. We introduce a Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts layer (MoE), consisting of up to thousands of feed-forward sub-networks. A trainable gating network determines a sparse combination of these experts to use for each example. We apply the MoE to the tasks of language modeling and machine translation, where model capacity is critical for absorbing the vast quantities of knowledge available in the training corpora. We present model architectures in which a MoE with up to 137 billion parameters is applied convolutionally between stacked LSTM layers.

However, their capabilities wane in highly specialized domains underrepresented in the pretraining corpus, such as physical and biomedical sciences. This work explores how to repurpose general LLMs into effective task solvers for specialized domains. We introduce a novel, model-agnostic framework for learning custom input tags, which are parameterized as continuous vectors appended to the LLM's embedding layer, to condition the LLM. We design two types of input tags: domain tags are used to delimit specialized representations (e.g., chemical formulas) and provide domain-relevant context; function tags are used to represent specific functions (e.g., predicting molecular properties) and compress function-solving instructions. We develop a three-stage protocol to learn these tags using auxiliary data and domain knowledge. By explicitly disentangling task domains from task functions, our method enables zero-shot generalization to unseen problems through diverse combinations of the input tags. It also boosts LLM's performance in various specialized domains, such as predicting protein or chemical properties and modeling drug-target interactions, outperforming expert models tailored to these tasks.", "arxivid": "2402.05140v3"}

Existing datasets either have a small proportion of questions about text (e.g., the VQA dataset) or are too small (e.g., the VizWiz dataset). TextVQA contains 45,336 questions on 28,408 images that require reasoning about text to answer. Second, we introduce a novel model architecture that reads text in the image, reasons about it in the context of the image and the question, and predicts an answer which might be a deduction based on the text and the image or composed of the strings found in the image. Consequently, we call our approach Look, Read, Reason & Answer (LoRRA). We show that LoRRA outperforms existing state-of-the-art VQA models on our TextVQA dataset.

Furthermore, to maintain scalability, Dynamic ConPET adopts separate PET modules for different tasks and a PET module selector for dynamic optimal selection. In our extensive experiments, the adaptation of Static ConPET helps multiple former methods reduce the scale of tunable parameters by over 3,000 times and surpass the PET-only baseline by at least 5 points on five smaller benchmarks, while Dynamic ConPET gains its advantage on the largest dataset.

{"title": "Three types of incremental learning", "abstract": "Incrementally learning new information from a non-stationary stream of data, referred to as ‘continual learning’, is a key feature of natural intelligence, but a challenging problem for deep neural networks. In recent years, numerous deep learning methods for continual learning have been proposed, but comparing their performances is difficult due to the lack of a common framework. To help address this, we describe three fundamental types, or ‘scenarios’, of continual learning: task-incremental, domain-incremental and class-incremental learning. Each of these scenarios has its own set of challenges. To illustrate this, we provide a comprehensive empirical comparison of currently used continual learning strategies, by performing the Split MNIST and Split CIFAR-100 protocols according to each scenario. We demonstrate substantial differences between the three scenarios in terms of difficulty and in terms of the effectiveness of different strategies. The proposed categorization aims to structure the continual learning field, by forming a key foundation for clearly defining benchmark problems. A challenge for any machine learning system is to continually adapt to new data. While methods to address this issue are developed, their performance is hard to compare. A new framework to facilitate benchmarking divides approaches into three categories, defined by whether models need to adapt to new tasks, domains or classes.", "arxivid": "2405.08015v1"}

However, the design of model architecture remains an open question: In general, learning all tasks with a shared set of parameters suffers from severe interference between tasks; while learning each task with a dedicated parameter subspace is limited by scalability. In this work, we theoretically analyze the generalization errors for learning plasticity and memory stability in continual learning, which can be uniformly upper-bounded by (1) discrepancy between task distributions, (2) flatness of loss landscape and (3) cover of parameter space. Then, inspired by the robust biological learning system that processes sequential experiences with multiple parallel compartments, we propose Cooperation of Small Continual Learners (CoSCL) as a general strategy for continual learning. Specifically, we present an architecture with a fixed number of narrower sub-networks to learn all incremental tasks in parallel, which can naturally reduce the two errors through improving the three components of the upper bound. To strengthen this advantage, we encourage to cooperate these sub-networks by penalizing the difference of predictions made by their feature representations. With a fixed parameter budget, CoSCL can improve a variety of representative continual learning approaches by a large margin (e.g., up to 10.64% on CIFAR-100-SC, 9.33% on CIFAR-100-RS, 11.45% on CUB-200-2011 and 6.72% on Tiny-ImageNet) and achieve the new state-of-the-art performance.", "arxivid": "2207.06543v1"}

Beyond this, increasingly numerous advances have emerged in recent years that largely extend the understanding and application of continual learning. The growing and widespread interest in this direction demonstrates its realistic significance as well as complexity. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of continual learning, seeking to bridge the basic settings, theoretical foundations, representative methods, and practical applications.

Where the updated knowledge resides in memories is a fundamental question for model editing. In this paper, we find that editing either long-term memory (direct model parameters) or working memory (non-parametric knowledge of neural network activations/representations by retrieval) will result in an impossible triangle -- reliability, generalization, and locality can not be realized together in the lifelong editing settings. For long-term memory, directly editing the parameters will cause conflicts with irrelevant pretrained knowledge or previous edits (poor reliability and locality). For working memory, retrieval-based activations can hardly make the model understand the edits and generalize (poor generalization). Therefore, we propose WISE to bridge the gap between memories. In WISE, we design a dual parametric memory scheme, which consists of the main memory for the pretrained knowledge and a side memory for the edited knowledge. We only edit the knowledge in the side memory and train a router to decide which memory to go through when given a query. For continual editing, we devise a knowledge-sharding mechanism where different sets of edits reside in distinct subspaces of parameters, and are subsequently merged into a shared memory without conflicts. Extensive experiments show that WISE can outperform previous model editing methods and overcome the impossible triangle under lifelong model editing of question answering, hallucination, and out-of-distribution settings across trending LLM architectures, e.g., GPT, LLaMA, and Mistral.

To address this, we propose K-Adapter, which remains the original parameters of the pre-trained model fixed and supports continual knowledge infusion. Taking RoBERTa as the pre-trained model, K-Adapter has a neural adapter for each kind of infused knowledge, like a plug-in connected to RoBERTa. There is no information flow between different adapters, thus different adapters are efficiently trained in a distributed way. We inject two kinds of knowledge, including factual knowledge obtained from automatically aligned text-triplets on Wikipedia and Wikidata, and linguistic knowledge obtained from dependency parsing. Results on three knowledge-driven tasks (total six datasets) including relation classification, entity typing and question answering demonstrate that each adapter improves the performance, and the combination of both adapters brings further improvements.

In this paper, we introduce TRACE, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate continual learning in LLMs. TRACE consists of 8 distinct datasets spanning challenging tasks including domain-specific tasks, multilingual capabilities, code generation, and mathematical reasoning. All datasets are standardized into a unified format, allowing for effortless automatic evaluation of LLMs. Our experiments show that after training on TRACE, aligned LLMs exhibit significant declines in both general ability and instruction-following capabilities. For example, the accuracy of llama2-chat 13B on gsm8k dataset declined precipitously from 28.8\\% to 2\\% after training on our datasets. This highlights the challenge of finding a suitable tradeoff between achieving performance on specific tasks while preserving the original prowess of LLMs. Empirical findings suggest that tasks inherently equipped with reasoning paths contribute significantly to preserving certain capabilities of LLMs against potential declines.

{"title": "Codet5+: Open code large language models for code understanding and generation", "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) pretrained on vast source code have achieved prominent progress in code intelligence. However, existing code LLMs have two main limitations in terms of architecture and pretraining tasks. First, they often adopt a specific architecture (encoder-only or decoder-only) or rely on a unified encoder-decoder network for different downstream tasks. The former paradigm is limited by inflexibility in applications while in the latter, the model is treated as a single system for all tasks, leading to suboptimal performance on a subset of tasks. Secondly, they often employ a limited set of pretraining objectives which might not be relevant to some downstream tasks and hence result in substantial performance degrade. To address these limitations, we propose ``CodeT5+'', a family of encoder-decoder LLMs for code in which component modules can be flexibly combined to suit a wide range of downstream code tasks. Such flexibility is enabled by our proposed mixture of pretraining objectives to mitigate the pretrain-finetune discrepancy. These objectives cover span denoising, contrastive learning, text-code matching, and causal LM pretraining tasks, on both unimodal and bimodal multilingual code corpora.

In this work, we propose a novel framework called Sparse Continual Learning(SparCL), which is the first study that leverages sparsity to enable cost-effective continual learning on edge devices.

In this paper, we stress the need for adapting PLMs of code to software data whose distribution changes over time, a crucial problem that has been overlooked in previous works. The motivation of this work is to consider the PLM in a non-stationary environment, where fine-tuning data evolves over time according to a software evolution scenario. Specifically, we design a scenario where the model needs to learn from a stream of programs containing new, unseen APIs over time. We study two widely used PLM architectures, i.e., a GPT2 decoder and a RoBERTa encoder, on two downstream tasks, API call and API usage prediction. We demonstrate that the most commonly used fine-tuning technique from prior work is not robust enough to handle the dynamic nature of APIs, leading to the loss of previously acquired knowledge i.e., catastrophic forgetting.

{"title": "Large scale incremental learning", "abstract": "Modern machine learning suffers from \\textit{catastrophic forgetting} when learning new classes incrementally. The performance dramatically degrades due to the missing data of old classes. Incremental learning methods have been proposed to retain the knowledge acquired from the old classes, by using knowledge distilling and keeping a few exemplars from the old classes. However, these methods struggle to \\textbf{scale up to a large number of classes}. We believe this is because of the combination of two factors: (a) the data imbalance between the old and new classes, and (b) the increasing number of visually similar classes. Distinguishing between an increasing number of visually similar classes is particularly challenging, when the training data is unbalanced. We propose a simple and effective method to address this data imbalance issue. We found that the last fully connected layer has a strong bias towards the new classes, and this bias can be corrected by a linear model. With two bias parameters, our method performs remarkably well on two large datasets: ImageNet (1000 classes) and MS-Celeb-1M (10000 classes), outperforming the state-of-the-art algorithms by 11.1\\% and 13.2\\% respectively.", "arxivid": "1905.13260v1"}

{"title": "Data selection for language models via importance resampling", "abstract": "Selecting a suitable pretraining dataset is crucial for both general-domain (e.g., GPT-3) and domain-specific (e.g., Codex) language models (LMs). We formalize this problem as selecting a subset of a large raw unlabeled dataset to match a desired target distribution given unlabeled target samples. Due to the scale and dimensionality of the raw text data, existing methods use simple heuristics or require human experts to manually curate data. Instead, we extend the classic importance resampling approach used in low-dimensions for LM data selection. We propose Data Selection with Importance Resampling (DSIR), an efficient and scalable framework that estimates importance weights in a reduced feature space for tractability and selects data with importance resampling according to these weights. We instantiate the DSIR framework with hashed n-gram features for efficiency, enabling the selection of 100M documents from the full Pile dataset in 4.5 hours. To measure whether hashed n-gram features preserve the aspects of the data that are relevant to the target, we define KL reduction, a data metric that measures the proximity between the selected pretraining data and the target on some feature space. Across 8 data selection methods (including expert selection), KL reduction on hashed n-gram features highly correlates with average downstream accuracy (r=0.82). When selecting data for continued pretraining on a specific domain, DSIR performs comparably to expert curation across 8 target distributions.

This line of research focuses on developing general-purpose LLMs through fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs and vision models. However, catastrophic forgetting, a notorious phenomenon where the fine-tuned model fails to retain similar performance compared to the pre-trained model, still remains an inherent problem in multimodal LLMs (MLLM). In this paper, we introduce EMT: Evaluating MulTimodality for evaluating the catastrophic forgetting in MLLMs, by treating each MLLM as an image classifier. We first apply EMT to evaluate several open-source fine-tuned MLLMs and we discover that almost all evaluated MLLMs fail to retain the same performance levels as their vision encoders on standard image classification tasks. Moreover, we continue fine-tuning LLaVA, an MLLM and utilize EMT to assess performance throughout the fine-tuning. Interestingly, our results suggest that early-stage fine-tuning on an image dataset improves performance across other image datasets, by enhancing the alignment of text and visual features. However, as fine-tuning proceeds, the MLLMs begin to hallucinate, resulting in a significant loss of generalizability, even when the image encoder remains frozen.

However, there is a scarcity of open-sourced chat models specifically designed for the Chinese language, especially in the field of Chinese finance, at the scale of hundreds of billions.

{"title": "Continual sequence generation with adaptive compositional modules", "abstract": "Continual learning is essential for real-world deployment when there is a need to quickly adapt the model to new tasks without forgetting knowledge of old tasks. Existing work on continual sequence generation either always reuses existing parameters to learn new tasks, which is vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting on dissimilar tasks, or blindly adds new parameters for every new task, which could prevent knowledge sharing between similar tasks. To get the best of both worlds, in this work, we propose continual sequence generation with adaptive compositional modules to adaptively add modules in transformer architectures and compose both old and new modules for new tasks. We also incorporate pseudo experience replay to facilitate knowledge transfer in those shared modules. Experiment results on various sequences of generation tasks show that our framework can adaptively add modules or reuse modules based on task similarity, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both performance and parameter efficiency.

{"title": "CITB: A benchmark for continual instruction tuning", "abstract": "Continual learning (CL) is a paradigm that aims to replicate the human ability to learn and accumulate knowledge continually without forgetting previous knowledge and transferring it to new tasks. Recent instruction tuning (IT) involves fine-tuning models to make them more adaptable to solving NLP tasks in general. However, it is still uncertain how instruction tuning works in the context of CL tasks. This challenging yet practical problem is formulated as Continual Instruction Tuning (CIT). In this work, we establish a CIT benchmark consisting of learning and evaluation protocols. We curate two long dialogue task streams of different types, InstrDialog and InstrDialog++, to study various CL methods systematically. Our experiments show that existing CL methods do not effectively leverage the rich natural language instructions, and fine-tuning an instruction-tuned model sequentially can yield similar or better results. We further explore different aspects that might affect the learning of CIT. We hope this benchmark will facilitate more research in this direction.", "arxivid": "2310.14510v1"}

{"title": "Large language model can continue evolving from mistakes", "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable success, but their static nature leads to inherent limitations and persistent mistakes in dynamic real-world scenarios. While Continual Instruction Tuning (CIT) and Continual Pre-training (CPT) are primary continual learning approaches, they struggle with scalable knowledge acquisition and maintaining model capabilities. To address these, we propose the Continue Evolving from Mistakes (CEM) method, a novel and data-efficient framework for continuous LLM evolution. Inspired by human learning, CEM establishes an iterative process: it efficiently collects targeted CPT data by robustly identifying LLM mistakes and uncertainties (via an Ambiguity-Aware Knowledge Collection (AAKC) algorithm), and employs a novel joint training paradigm that leverages CIT and CPT to assimilate knowledge efficiently while maintaining existing capabilities and mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments confirm CEM's effectiveness, yielding substantial accuracy gains for multiple models, increasing accuracy by up to 29.63%.

{"title": "Memory-efficient class-incremental learning for image classification", "abstract": "With the memory-resource-limited constraints, class-incremental learning (CIL) usually suffers from the “catastrophic forgetting” problem when updating the joint classification model on the arrival of newly added classes. To cope with the forgetting problem, many CIL methods transfer the knowledge of old classes by preserving some exemplar samples into the size-constrained memory buffer. To utilize the memory buffer more efficiently, we propose to keep more auxiliary low-fidelity exemplar samples, rather than the original real-high-fidelity exemplar samples. Such a memory-efficient exemplar preserving scheme makes the old-class knowledge transfer more effective. However, the low-fidelity exemplar samples are often distributed in a different domain away from that of the original exemplar samples, that is, a domain shift. To alleviate this problem, we propose a duplet learning scheme that seeks to construct domain-compatible feature extractors and classifiers, which greatly narrows down the above domain gap. As a result, these low-fidelity auxiliary exemplar samples have the ability to moderately replace the original exemplar samples with a lower memory cost. In addition, we present a robust classifier adaptation scheme, which further refines the biased classifier (learned with the samples containing distillation label knowledge about old classes) with the help of the samples of pure true class labels. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this work against the state-of-the-art approaches. We will release the code, baselines, and training statistics for all models to facilitate future research.", "arxivid": "2008.01411v2"}
{"title": "Reconstruct before query: Continual missing modality learning with decomposed prompt collaboration", "abstract": "Pre-trained large multi-modal models (LMMs) exploit fine-tuning to adapt diverse user applications. Nevertheless, fine-tuning may face challenges due to deactivated sensors (e.g., cameras turned off for privacy or technical issues), yielding modality-incomplete data and leading to inconsistency in training data and the data for inference. Additionally, continuous training leads to catastrophic forgetting, diluting the knowledge in pre-trained LMMs. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel task, Continual Missing Modality Learning (CMML), to investigate how models can generalize when data of certain modalities is missing during continual fine-tuning. Our preliminary benchmarks reveal that existing methods suffer from a significant performance drop in CMML, even with the aid of advanced continual learning techniques. Therefore, we devise a framework termed Reconstruct before Query (RebQ). It decomposes prompts into modality-specific ones and breaks them into components stored in pools accessible via a key-query mechanism, which facilitates ParameterEfficient Fine-Tuning and enhances knowledge transferability for subsequent tasks. Meanwhile, our RebQ leverages extensive multi-modal knowledge from pre-trained LMMs to reconstruct the data of missing modality. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RebQ effectively reconstructs the missing modality information and retains pre-trained knowledge. Specifically, compared with the baseline, RebQ improves average precision from 20.00 to 50.92 and decreases average forgetting from 75.95 to 8.56.

{"title": "Sapt: A shared attention framework for parameter-efficient continual learning of large language models", "abstract": "The continual learning (CL) ability is vital for deploying large language models (LLMs) in the dynamic world. Existing methods devise the learning module to acquire task-specific knowledge with parameter-efficient tuning (PET) block and the selection module to pick out the corresponding one for the testing input, aiming at handling the challenges of catastrophic forgetting and knowledge transfer in CL. However, these methods tend to address only one of the challenges, ignoring the potential of aligning the two modules to effectively address catastrophic forgetting and knowledge transfer simultaneously. To this end, we propose a novel Shared Attention Framework (SAPT), to align the PET learning and selection via the Shared Attentive Learning \\&Selection module. Extensive Experiments on two CL benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of SAPT.

{"title": "Beyond anti-forgetting: Multimodal continual instruction tuning with positive forward transfer", "abstract": "Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning (MCIT) enables Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to meet continuously emerging requirements without expensive retraining. MCIT faces two major obstacles: catastrophic forgetting (where old knowledge is forgotten) and negative forward transfer (where the performance of future tasks is degraded). Although existing methods have greatly alleviated catastrophic forgetting, they still suffer from negative forward transfer. We discover a large discrepancy in different input embeddings by performing singular value decomposition (SVD) on input embeddings. This discrepancy results in the model learning irrelevant information for old and pre-trained tasks, leading to catastrophic forgetting and negative forward transfer. To address these issues, we propose Prompt Tuning with Positive Forward Transfer (Fwd-Prompt), a prompt-based method that projects the prompt gradient to the residual space to minimize interference between tasks and to the pre-trained subspace for reusing pre-trained knowledge. Our experiments demonstrate that Fwd-Prompt achieves state-of-the-art performance while updating fewer parameters and requiring no old samples.

{"title": "Learn or recall? revisiting incremental learning with pre-trained language models", "abstract": "Incremental Learning (IL) has been a long-standing problem in both vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) communities. In recent years, as Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in various NLP downstream tasks, utilizing PLMs as backbones has become a common practice in recent research of IL in NLP. Most assume that catastrophic forgetting is the biggest obstacle to achieving superior IL performance and propose various techniques to overcome this issue. However, we find that this assumption is problematic. Specifically, we revisit more than 20 methods on four classification tasks (Text Classification, Intent Classification, Relation Extraction, and Named Entity Recognition) under the two most popular IL settings (Class-Incremental and Task-Incremental) and reveal that most of them severely underestimate the inherent anti-forgetting ability of PLMs. Based on the observation, we propose a frustratingly easy method called SEQ* for IL with PLMs. The results show that SEQ* has competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) IL methods and requires considerably less trainable parameters and training time. These findings urge us to revisit the IL with PLMs and encourage future studies to have a fundamental understanding of the catastrophic forgetting in PLMs. The data, code and scripts are publicly available at https://github.com/zzz47zzz/codebase-for-incremental-learning-with-llm.", "arxivid": "2312.07887v5"}
{"title": "Preventing zero-shot transfer degradation in continual learning of vision-language models", "abstract": "Continual learning (CL) can help pre-trained vision-language models efficiently adapt to new or under-trained data distributions without re-training. Nevertheless, during the continual training of the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, we observe that the model’s zero-shot transfer ability significantly degrades due to catastrophic forgetting. Existing CL methods can mitigate forgetting by replaying previous data. However, since the CLIP dataset is private, replay methods cannot access the pre-training dataset. In addition, replaying data of previously learned downstream tasks can enhance their performance but comes at the cost of sacrificing zero-shot performance. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method ZSCL to prevent zero-shot transfer degradation in the continual learning of vision-language models in both feature and parameter space. In the feature space, a reference dataset is introduced for distillation between the current and initial models. The reference dataset should have semantic diversity but no need to be labeled, seen in pre-training, or matched image-text pairs. In parameter space, we prevent a large parameter shift by averaging weights during the training. We propose a more challenging Multi-domain Task Incremental Learning (MTIL) benchmark to evaluate different methods, where tasks are from various domains instead of class-separated in a single dataset. Our method outperforms other methods in the traditional class-incremental learning setting and the MTIL by 9.7% average score.

To augment PTLMs with concept-centric commonsense knowledge, in this paper, we propose both generative and contrastive objectives for learning common sense from the text, and use them as intermediate self-supervised learning tasks for incrementally pre-training PTLMs (before task-specific fine-tuning on downstream datasets). Furthermore, we develop a joint pre-training framework to unify generative and contrastive objectives so that they can mutually reinforce each other. Extensive experimental results show that our method, concept-aware language model (CALM), can pack more commonsense knowledge into the parameters of a pre-trained text-to-text transformer without relying on external knowledge graphs, yielding better performance on both NLU and NLG tasks. We show that while only incrementally pre-trained on a relatively small corpus for a few steps, CALM outperforms baseline methods by a consistent margin and even comparable with some larger PTLMs, which suggests that CALM can serve as a general, plug-and-play method for improving the commonsense reasoning ability of a PTLM.", "arxivid": "2011.07956v2"}
