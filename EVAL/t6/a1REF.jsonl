Without modifying a large language model's weights, it can be tuned to perform various downstream natural language tasks simply by including concatenated training examples of these tasks in its input. Though disruptive for many practical applications of large language models, this emergent learning paradigm is not well understood from a theoretical perspective. In this paper, we propose a first-of-its-kind PAC based framework for in-context learnability, and use it to provide the first finite sample complexity results for the in-context learning setup. Our framework includes an initial pretraining phase, which fits a function to the pretraining distribution, and then a second in-context learning phase, which keeps this function constant and concatenates training examples of the downstream task in its input. We use our framework in order to prove that, under mild assumptions, when the pretraining distribution is a mixture of latent tasks (a model often considered for natural language pretraining), these tasks can be efficiently learned via in-context learning, even though the model's weights are unchanged and the input significantly diverges from the pretraining distribution. Our theoretical analysis reveals that in this setting, in-context learning is more about identifying the task than about learning it, a result which is in line with a series of recent empirical findings. We hope that the in-context learnability framework presented in this paper will facilitate future progress towards a deeper understanding of this important new learning paradigm."}

We aim to close these gaps by proposing a theoretical framework, the Pelican Soup Framework. In this framework, we introduce (1) the notion of a common sense knowledge base, (2) a general formalism for natural language classification tasks, and the notion of (3) meaning association. Under this framework, we can establish a $\\mathcal{O}(1/T)$ loss bound for in-context learning, where $T$ is the number of example-label pairs in the demonstration. Compared with previous works, our bound reflects the effect of the choice of verbalizers and the effect of instruction tuning. An additional notion of \\textit{atom concepts} makes our framework possible to explain the generalization to tasks unseen in the language model training data. Finally, we propose a toy setup, Calcutec, and a digit addition task that mimics types of distribution shifts a model needs to overcome to perform in-context learning. We also experiment with GPT2-Large on real-world NLP tasks. Our empirical results demonstrate the efficacy of our framework to explain in-context learning."}

A Case Study of Simple Function Classes", "abstract": "In-context learning refers to the ability of a model to condition on a prompt sequence consisting of in-context examples (input-output pairs corresponding to some task) along with a new query input, and generate the corresponding output. Crucially, in-context learning happens only at inference time without any parameter updates to the model. While large language models such as GPT-3 exhibit some ability to perform in-context learning, it is unclear what the relationship is between tasks on which this succeeds and what is present in the training data. To make progress towards understanding in-context learning, we consider the well-defined problem of training a model to in-context learn a function class (e.g., linear functions): that is, given data derived from some functions in the class, can we train a model to in-context learn \"most\" functions from this class? We show empirically that standard Transformers can be trained from scratch to perform in-context learning of linear functions -- that is, the trained model is able to learn unseen linear functions from in-context examples with performance comparable to the optimal least squares estimator. In fact, in-context learning is possible even under two forms of distribution shift: (i) between the training data of the model and inference-time prompts, and (ii) between the in-context examples and the query input during inference. We also show that we can train Transformers to in-context learn more complex function classes -- namely sparse linear functions, two-layer neural networks, and decision trees -- with performance that matches or exceeds task-specific learning algorithms.

Despite progress, theoretical understanding of this phenomenon remains limited. We argue that in-context learning relies on recombination of compositional operations found in natural language data. We derive an information-theoretic bound showing how in-context learning abilities arise from generic next-token prediction when the pretraining distribution has sufficient amounts of compositional structure, under linguistically motivated assumptions. A second bound provides a theoretical justification for the empirical success of prompting LLMs to output intermediate steps towards an answer. To validate theoretical predictions, we introduce a controlled setup for inducing in-context learning; unlike previous approaches, it accounts for the compositional nature of language. Trained transformers can perform in-context learning for a range of tasks, in a manner consistent with the theoretical results. Mirroring real-world LLMs in a miniature setup, in-context learning emerges when scaling parameters and data, and models perform better when prompted to output intermediate steps. Probing shows that in-context learning is supported by a representation of the input's compositional structure. Taken together, these results provide a step towards theoretical understanding of emergent behavior in large language models."}

Influential psychological theories explain this seemingly disparate behavioral evidence by positing two qualitatively different learning systems -- one for rapid, rule-based inferences and another for slow, incremental adaptation. It remains unclear how to reconcile such theories with neural networks, which learn via incremental weight updates and are thus a natural model for the latter type of learning, but are not obviously compatible with the former. However, recent evidence suggests that metalearning neural networks and large language models are capable of \"in-context learning\" (ICL) -- the ability to flexibly grasp the structure of a new task from a few examples. Here, we show that the dynamic interplay between ICL and default in-weight learning (IWL) naturally captures a broad range of learning phenomena observed in humans, reproducing curriculum effects on category-learning and compositional tasks, and recapitulating a tradeoff between flexibility and retention. Our work shows how emergent ICL can equip neural networks with fundamentally different learning properties that can coexist with their native IWL, thus offering a novel perspective on dual-process theories and human cognitive flexibility."}

Previous work curating in-context learners assumes that ICL emerges from a vast over-parametrization or the scale of multi-task training. However, recent theoretical work attributes the ICL ability to concept-dependent training data and creates functional in-context learners even in small-scale, synthetic settings. In this work, we practically explore this newly identified axis of ICL quality. We propose Concept-aware Training (CoAT), a framework for constructing training scenarios that make it beneficial for the LM to learn to utilize the analogical reasoning concepts from demonstrations. We find that by using CoAT, pre-trained transformers can learn to better utilise new latent concepts from demonstrations and that such ability makes ICL more robust to the functional deficiencies of the previous models. Finally, we show that concept-aware in-context learning is more effective for a majority of new tasks when compared to traditional instruction tuning, resulting in a performance comparable to the previous in-context learners using magnitudes of more training data."}

In this work, we formalize in-context learning as an algorithm learning problem where a transformer model implicitly constructs a hypothesis function at inference-time. We first explore the statistical aspects of this abstraction through the lens of multitask learning: We obtain generalization bounds for ICL when the input prompt is (1) a sequence of i.i.d. (input, label) pairs or (2) a trajectory arising from a dynamical system. The crux of our analysis is relating the excess risk to the stability of the algorithm implemented by the transformer. We characterize when transformer/attention architecture provably obeys the stability condition and also provide empirical verification. For generalization on unseen tasks, we identify an inductive bias phenomenon in which the transfer learning risk is governed by the task complexity and the number of MTL tasks in a highly predictable manner. Finally, we provide numerical evaluations that (1) demonstrate transformers can indeed implement near-optimal algorithms on classical regression problems with i.i.d. and dynamic data, (2) provide insights on stability, and (3) verify our theoretical predictions."}

The LM learns from these examples without being explicitly pretrained to learn. Thus, it is unclear what enables in-context learning. In this paper, we study how in-context learning can emerge when pretraining documents have long-range coherence. Here, the LM must infer a latent document-level concept to generate coherent next tokens during pretraining. At test time, in-context learning occurs when the LM also infers a shared latent concept between examples in a prompt. We prove when this occurs despite a distribution mismatch between prompts and pretraining data in a setting where the pretraining distribution is a mixture of HMMs. In contrast to messy large-scale datasets used to train LMs capable of in-context learning, we generate a small-scale synthetic dataset (GINC) where Transformers and LSTMs both exhibit in-context learning. Beyond the theory, experiments on GINC exhibit large-scale real-world phenomena including improved in-context performance with model scaling (despite the same pretraining loss), sensitivity to example order, and instances where zero-shot is better than few-shot in-context learning."}

However, their capabilities of in-context learning are limited by the model architecture: 1) the use of demonstrations is constrained by a maximum sentence length due to positional embeddings; 2) the quadratic complexity of attention hinders users from using more demonstrations efficiently; 3) LLMs are shown to be sensitive to the order of the demonstrations. In this work, we tackle these challenges by proposing a better architectural design for in-context learning. We propose SAICL (Structured Attention for In-Context Learning), which replaces the full-attention by a structured attention mechanism designed for in-context learning, and removes unnecessary dependencies between individual demonstrations, while making the model invariant to the permutation of demonstrations. We evaluate SAICL in a meta-training framework and show that SAICL achieves comparable or better performance than full attention while obtaining up to 3.4x inference speed-up. SAICL also consistently outperforms a strong Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD) baseline which processes each demonstration independently. Finally, thanks to its linear nature, we demonstrate that SAICL can easily scale to hundreds of demonstrations with continuous performance gains with scaling."}

In this paper, we show that ground truth demonstrations are in fact not required -- randomly replacing labels in the demonstrations barely hurts performance on a range of classification and multi-choce tasks, consistently over 12 different models including GPT-3. Instead, we find that other aspects of the demonstrations are the key drivers of end task performance, including the fact that they provide a few examples of (1) the label space, (2) the distribution of the input text, and (3) the overall format of the sequence. Together, our analysis provides a new way of understanding how and why in-context learning works, while opening up new questions about how much can be learned from large language models through inference alone."}

However, this perspective overlooks the potential benefits derived from multiple iterations involving demonstrations, a practice aligning more closely with the iterative decision-making process exhibited by humans, who often learn through analogy. In this study, we introduce a novel two-stage framework to boost ICL in LLMs. Specifically, our framework delineates the ICL process into two distinct stages: Deep-Thinking and test stages. The Deep-Thinking stage incorporates a unique attention mechanism, i.e., iterative enhanced attention, which enables multiple rounds of information accumulation. This mechanism operates by manipulating the Key-Value matrices without training, fostering enhanced understanding capabilities in LLMs by thinking demonstrations multiple times. We evaluated Deep-Thinking across a range of benchmarks and LLMs, showing its superior performance over vanilla ICL methods and its effectiveness in challenging tasks where demonstration selection is infeasible."}

Training Transformers to possess this in-context learning skill is computationally intensive due to the occurrence of learning plateaus, which are periods within the training process where there is minimal or no enhancement in the model's in-context learning capability. To study the mechanism behind the learning plateaus, we conceptually seperate a component within the model's internal representation that is exclusively affected by the model's weights. We call this the \"weights component\", and the remainder is identified as the \"context component\". By conducting meticulous and controlled experiments on synthetic tasks, we note that the persistence of learning plateaus correlates with compromised functionality of the weights component. Recognizing the impaired performance of the weights component as a fundamental behavior drives learning plateaus, we have developed three strategies to expedite the learning of Transformers. The effectiveness of these strategies is further confirmed in natural language processing tasks. In conclusion, our research demonstrates the feasibility of cultivating a powerful in-context learning ability within AI systems in an eco-friendly manner."}

To explore this, we simplify pre-training data and pre-train 36 causal language models with parameters varying from 1 million to 165 million parameters. We show that models trained on this simplified pre-training data demonstrate enhanced zero-shot capabilities across various tasks in simplified language, achieving performance comparable to that of pre-trained models six times larger on unrestricted language. This suggests that downscaling the language allows zero-shot learning capabilities to emerge in models with limited size. Additionally, we find that these smaller models pre-trained on simplified data demonstrate a power law relationship between the evaluation loss and the three scaling factors: compute, dataset size, and model size."}

Over the course of training, complex computational structures form and re-form inside the neural network, leading to shifts in input/output behavior. It is a priority for the science of deep learning to uncover principles governing the development of neural network structure and behavior. Drawing on the framework of singular learning theory, we propose that model development is deeply linked to degeneracy in the local geometry of the loss landscape. We investigate this link by monitoring loss landscape degeneracy throughout training, as quantified by the local learning coefficient, for a transformer language model and an in-context linear regression transformer. We show that training can be divided into distinct periods of change in loss landscape degeneracy, and that these changes in degeneracy coincide with significant changes in the internal computational structure and the input/output behavior of the transformers. This finding provides suggestive evidence that degeneracy and development are linked in transformers, underscoring the potential of a degeneracy-based perspective for understanding modern deep learning."}

A mechanistic study of in-context learning circuits and their formation", "abstract": "In-context learning is a powerful emergent ability in transformer models. Prior work in mechanistic interpretability has identified a circuit element that may be critical for in-context learning -- the induction head (IH), which performs a match-and-copy operation. During training of large transformers on natural language data, IHs emerge around the same time as a notable phase change in the loss. Despite the robust evidence for IHs and this interesting coincidence with the phase change, relatively little is known about the diversity and emergence dynamics of IHs. Why is there more than one IH, and how are they dependent on each other? Why do IHs appear all of a sudden, and what are the subcircuits that enable them to emerge? We answer these questions by studying IH emergence dynamics in a controlled setting by training on synthetic data. In doing so, we develop and share a novel optogenetics-inspired causal framework for modifying activations throughout training. Using this framework, we delineate the diverse and additive nature of IHs. By clamping subsets of activations throughout training, we then identify three underlying subcircuits that interact to drive IH formation, yielding the phase change. Furthermore, these subcircuits shed light on data-dependent properties of formation, such as phase change timing, already showing the promise of this more in-depth understanding of subcircuits that need to \"go right\" for an induction head."}

Building on previous work, we investigate this question in a controlled setting, where we study transformer models trained on sequences of $(x, f(x))$ pairs rather than natural language. Our empirical results show transformers demonstrate near-optimal unsupervised model selection capabilities, in their ability to first in-context identify different task families and in-context learn within them when the task families are well-represented in their pretraining data. However when presented with tasks or functions which are out-of-domain of their pretraining data, we demonstrate various failure modes of transformers and degradation of their generalization for even simple extrapolation tasks. Together our results highlight that the impressive ICL abilities of high-capacity sequence models may be more closely tied to the coverage of their pretraining data mixtures than inductive biases that create fundamental generalization capabilities."}

Using a 66 billion parameter language model (OPT-66B) across a diverse set of 14 downstream tasks, we find this is indeed the case: $\\sim$70% of attention heads and $\\sim$20% of feed forward networks can be removed with minimal decline in task performance. We find substantial overlap in the set of attention heads (un)important for in-context learning across tasks and number of in-context examples. We also address our hypothesis through a task-agnostic lens, finding that a small set of attention heads in OPT-66B score highly on their ability to perform primitive induction operations associated with in-context learning, namely, prefix matching and copying. These induction heads overlap with task-specific important heads, reinforcing arguments by Olsson et al. (arXiv:2209.11895) regarding induction head generality to more sophisticated behaviors associated with in-context learning.

It is not well understood why ICL ability emerges, as the model has never been specifically trained on such demonstrations. Unlike prior work that explores implicit mechanisms behind ICL, we study ICL via investigating the pretraining data. Specifically, we first adapt an iterative, gradient-based approach to find a small subset of pretraining data that supports ICL. We observe that a continued pretraining on this small subset significantly improves the model's ICL ability, by up to 18%. We then compare the supportive subset constrastively with random subsets of pretraining data and discover: (1) The supportive pretraining data to ICL do not have a higher domain relevance to downstream tasks. (2) The supportive pretraining data have a higher mass of rarely occurring, long-tail tokens. (3) The supportive pretraining data are challenging examples where the information gain from long-range context is below average, indicating learning to incorporate difficult long-range context encourages ICL.

In this empirical study, we take the first steps toward answering this question. We evaluate thirteen model architectures capable of causal language modeling across a suite of synthetic in-context learning tasks. These selected architectures represent a broad range of paradigms, including recurrent and convolution-based neural networks, transformers, state space model inspired, and other emerging attention alternatives. We discover that all the considered architectures can perform in-context learning under a wider range of conditions than previously documented. Additionally, we observe stark differences in statistical efficiency and consistency by varying the number of in-context examples and task difficulty. We also measure each architecture's predisposition towards in-context learning when presented with the option to memorize rather than leverage in-context examples. Finally, and somewhat surprisingly, we find that several attention alternatives are sometimes competitive with or better in-context learners than transformers. However, no single architecture demonstrates consistency across all tasks, with performance either plateauing or declining when confronted with a significantly larger number of in-context examples than those encountered during gradient-based training."}

These computations are a staple of the MIT Lincoln Laboratory Supercomputing Center (LLSC) and has required the LLSC to develop unique interactive supercomputing capabilities. Scaling interactive machine learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow, and data analysis environments, such as MATLAB/Octave, to tens of thousands of cores presents many technical challenges - in particular, rapidly dispatching many tasks through a scheduler, such as Slurm, and starting many instances of applications with thousands of dependencies. Careful tuning of launches and prepositioning of applications overcome these challenges and allow the launching of thousands of tasks in seconds on a 40,000-core supercomputer. Specifically, this work demonstrates launching 32,000 TensorFlow processes in 4 seconds and launching 262,000 Octave processes in 40 seconds.

{"id": "32", "arxiv": "2305.11170v1", "title": "Efficient Prompting via Dynamic In-Context Learning", "abstract": "The primary way of building AI applications is shifting from training specialist models to prompting generalist models. A common practice for prompting generalist models, often referred to as in-context learning, is to append a few examples (demonstrations) to the prompt to help the model better understand the task. While effective, in-context learning can be inefficient because it makes the input prompt much longer, consuming valuable space in the context window and leading to larger computational costs. In this paper, we propose DynaICL, a recipe for efficient prompting with black-box generalist models that dynamically allocate in-context examples according to the input complexity and the computational budget. To achieve this, we train a meta controller that predicts the number of in-context examples suitable for the generalist model to make a good prediction based on the performance-efficiency trade-off for a specific input. We then dynamically allocate the number of demonstrations for an input according to predictions from the meta controller and the given computation budget. Experimental results show that dynamic example allocation helps achieve a better performance-efficiency trade-off in two practical settings where computational resources or the required performance is constrained. Specifically, DynaICL saves up to 46% token budget compared to the common practice that allocates the same number of in-context examples to each input. We also find that a meta controller trained on a certain backbone model and tasks can successfully generalize to unseen models and tasks."}

It has been shown highly dependent on the provided demonstrations and thus promotes the research of demonstration retrieval: given a test input, relevant examples are retrieved from the training set to serve as informative demonstrations for in-context learning. While previous works focus on training task-specific retrievers for several tasks separately, these methods are often hard to transfer and scale on various tasks, and separately trained retrievers incur a lot of parameter storage and deployment cost. In this paper, we propose Unified Demonstration Retriever (\\textbf{UDR}), a single model to retrieve demonstrations for a wide range of tasks. To train UDR, we cast various tasks' training signals into a unified list-wise ranking formulation by language model's feedback. Then we propose a multi-task list-wise ranking training framework, with an iterative mining strategy to find high-quality candidates, which can help UDR fully incorporate various tasks' signals. Experiments on 30+ tasks across 13 task families and multiple data domains show that UDR significantly outperforms baselines. Further analyses show the effectiveness of each proposed component and UDR's strong ability in various scenarios including different LMs (1.3B - 175B), unseen datasets, varying demonstration quantities, etc."}

While there is a growing body of literature focusing on prompt engineering, there is a lack of systematic analysis comparing the effects of prompts across different models and tasks. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive prompt analysis based on the sensitivity of a function. Our analysis reveals that sensitivity is an unsupervised proxy for model performance, as it exhibits a strong negative correlation with accuracy. We use gradient-based saliency scores to empirically demonstrate how different prompts affect the relevance of input tokens to the output, resulting in different levels of sensitivity. Furthermore, we introduce sensitivity-aware decoding which incorporates sensitivity estimation as a penalty term in the standard greedy decoding. We show that this approach is particularly helpful when information in the input is scarce. Our work provides a fresh perspective on the analysis of prompts, and contributes to a better understanding of the mechanism of ICL."}

However, only limited research exists on the layer-wise capability of LLMs to encode knowledge, which challenges our understanding of their internal mechanisms.

We leverage the powerful generative capability of ChatGPT to construct probing datasets, providing diverse and coherent evidence corresponding to various facts. We employ $\\mathcal V$-usable information as the validation metric to better reflect the capability in encoding context knowledge across different layers. Our experiments on conflicting and newly acquired knowledge show that LLMs: (1) prefer to encode more context knowledge in the upper layers; (2) primarily encode context knowledge within knowledge-related entity tokens at lower layers while progressively expanding more knowledge within other tokens at upper layers; and (3) gradually forget the earlier context knowledge retained within the intermediate layers when provided with irrelevant evidence.

As such, that learner must adapt to the context without additional training. We explore the role of softmax attention in an ICL setting where each context encodes a regression task. We show that an attention unit learns a window that it uses to implement a nearest-neighbors predictor adapted to the landscape of the pretraining tasks. Specifically, we show that this window widens with decreasing Lipschitzness and increasing label noise in the pretraining tasks. We also show that on low-rank, linear problems, the attention unit learns to project onto the appropriate subspace before inference. Further, we show that this adaptivity relies crucially on the softmax activation and thus cannot be replicated by the linear activation often studied in prior theoretical analyses."}

In particular, one class of deep learning models, known as deep belief networks, can discover intricate statistical structure in large data sets in a completely unsupervised fashion, by learning a generative model of the data using Hebbian-like learning mechanisms. Although these self-organizing systems can be conveniently formalized within the framework of statistical mechanics, their internal functioning remains opaque, because their emergent dynamics cannot be solved analytically.

While program induction and synthesis remain at the heart of foundational theories of artificial intelligence, only recently has the community moved forward in attempting to use program learning as a benchmark task itself. The cognitive science community has thus often assumed that if the brain has simulation and reasoning capabilities equivalent to a universal computer, then it must employ a serialized, symbolic representation.

This involves managing an agent's goals as well as continuously relating sensory information to these in its perception-cognition information stack. The more varied the environment of a learning agent is, the more general and flexible must be these mechanisms to handle a wider variety of relevant patterns, tasks, and goal structures. While many researchers agree that information at different levels of abstraction likely differs in its makeup and structure and processing mechanisms, agreement on the particulars of such differences is not generally shared in the research community. A binary processing architecture (often referred to as System-1 and System-2) has been proposed as a model of cognitive processing for low- and high-level information, respectively. We posit that cognition is not binary in this way and that knowledge at any level of abstraction involves what we refer to as neurosymbolic information, meaning that data at both high and low levels must contain both symbolic and subsymbolic information. Further, we argue that the main differentiating factor between the processing of high and low levels of data abstraction can be largely attributed to the nature of the involved attention mechanisms. We describe the key arguments behind this view and review relevant evidence from the literature."}

To unleash the power of LLMs in few-shot learning scenarios, we introduce a novel Knowledgeable In-Context Tuning (KICT) framework to further improve the performance of ICL: 1) injecting knowledge into LLMs during continual self-supervised pre-training, 2) judiciously selecting the examples for ICL with high knowledge relevance, and 3) calibrating the prediction results based on prior knowledge. We evaluate the proposed approaches on autoregressive models (e.g., GPT-style LLMs) over multiple text classification and question-answering tasks.

Recently, ICL has been employed in visual understanding tasks, such as semantic segmentation and image captioning, yielding promising results. However, existing visual ICL framework can not enable producing content across multiple modalities, which limits their potential usage scenarios. To address this issue, we present a new ICL framework for visual understanding with multi-modal output enabled. First, we quantize and embed both text and visual prompt into a unified representational space, structured as interleaved in-context sequences. Then a decoder-only sparse transformer architecture is employed to perform generative modeling on them, facilitating in-context learning. Thanks to this design, the model is capable of handling in-context vision understanding tasks with multimodal output in a unified pipeline.Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves competitive performance compared with specialized models and previous ICL baselines. Overall, our research takes a further step toward unified multimodal in-context learning."}

However, its performance can be significantly influenced by the order of in-context demonstration examples. In this paper, we found that causal language models (CausalLMs) are more sensitive to this order compared to prefix language models (PrefixLMs). We attribute this phenomenon to the auto-regressive attention masks within CausalLMs, which restrict each token from accessing information from subsequent tokens. This results in different receptive fields for samples at different positions, thereby leading to representation disparities across positions. To tackle this challenge, we introduce an unsupervised fine-tuning method, termed the Information-Augmented and Consistency-Enhanced approach. This approach utilizes contrastive learning to align representations of in-context examples across different positions and introduces a consistency loss to ensure similar representations for inputs with different permutations. This enhances the model's predictive consistency across permutations. Experimental results on five benchmarks suggest that our proposed method can reduce the sensitivity of CausalLMs to the order of in-context examples and exhibit robust generalizability, particularly when demonstrations are sourced from a candidate pool different from that used in the training phase, or when the number of in-context examples differs from what is used during training."}

Our findings reveal that label words in the demonstration examples function as anchors: (1) semantic information aggregates into label word representations during the shallow computation layers' processing; (2) the consolidated information in label words serves as a reference for LLMs' final predictions. Based on these insights, we introduce an anchor re-weighting method to improve ICL performance, a demonstration compression technique to expedite inference, and an analysis framework for diagnosing ICL errors in GPT2-XL. The promising applications of our findings again validate the uncovered ICL working mechanism and pave the way for future studies."}

Most of them, however, are targeted at improving model performance on a single downstream task. We consider a multi-task environment for dense prediction tasks, represented by a common backbone and independent task-specific heads. Our goal is to find the most efficient way to refine each task prediction by capturing cross-task contexts dependent on tasks' relations. We explore various attention-based contexts, such as global and local, in the multi-task setting and analyze their behavior when applied to refine each task independently. Empirical findings confirm that different source-target task pairs benefit from different context types. To automate the selection process, we propose an Adaptive Task-Relational Context (ATRC) module, which samples the pool of all available contexts for each task pair using neural architecture search and outputs the optimal configuration for deployment. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two important multi-task benchmarks, namely NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context.

Previous work curating these models assumes that ICL emerges from vast over-parametrization or the scale of multi-task training. However, a complementary branch of recent theoretical work attributes ICL emergence to specific properties of training data and creates functional in-context learners in small-scale, synthetic settings. Inspired by recent findings on data properties driving the emergence of ICL, we propose a method to create LMs able to better utilize the in-context information, by constructing training scenarios where it is beneficial for the LM to capture the analogical reasoning concepts. We measure that data sampling of Concept-aware Training (CoAT) consistently improves models' reasoning ability. As a result, the in-context learners trained with CoAT on only two datasets of a single (QA) task perform comparably to larger models trained on 1600+ tasks."}

However, action detection requires not only categorizing actions, but also localizing them in untrimmed videos. Therefore, transferring knowledge pertaining to temporal relations is critical for this task which is missing in the previous cross-modal KD frameworks. To this end, we aim at learning an augmented RGB representation for action detection, taking advantage of additional modalities at training time through KD. We propose a KD framework consisting of two levels of distillation. On one hand, atomic-level distillation encourages the RGB student to learn the sub-representation of the actions from the teacher in a contrastive manner. On the other hand, sequence-level distillation encourages the student to learn the temporal knowledge from the teacher, which consists of transferring the Global Contextual Relations and the Action Boundary Saliency. The result is an Augmented-RGB stream that can achieve competitive performance as the two-stream network while using only RGB at inference time. Extensive experimental analysis shows that our proposed distillation framework is generic and outperforms other popular cross-modal distillation methods in action detection task."}

Although learning the reward functions from demonstrations has achieved great success in various tasks, several other challenges are mostly ignored. Firstly, existing IRL methods try to learn the reward function from scratch without relying on any prior knowledge. Secondly, traditional IRL methods assume the reward functions are homogeneous across all the demonstrations. Some existing IRL methods managed to extend to the heterogeneous demonstrations. However, they still assume one hidden variable that affects the behavior and learn the underlying hidden variable together with the reward from demonstrations. To solve these issues, we present Context Hierarchy IRL(CHIRL), a new IRL algorithm that exploits the context to scale up IRL and learn reward functions of complex behaviors. CHIRL models the context hierarchically as a directed acyclic graph; it represents the reward function as a corresponding modular deep neural network that associates each network module with a node of the context hierarchy. The context hierarchy and the modular reward representation enable data sharing across multiple contexts and state abstraction, significantly improving the learning performance. CHIRL has a natural connection with hierarchical task planning when the context hierarchy represents subtask decomposition. It enables to incorporate the prior knowledge of causal dependencies of subtasks and make it capable of solving large complex tasks by decoupling it into several subtasks and conquering each subtask to solve the original task. Experiments on benchmark tasks, including a large scale autonomous driving task in the CARLA simulator, show promising results in scaling up IRL for tasks with complex reward functions."}

However, demonstrations of the same skill may exhibit significant variances, or learning systems may attempt to acquire different means of the same skill simultaneously, making it challenging to encode these motions into movement primitives. To address these challenges, we propose an LfD framework, namely the Conditional Neural Expert Processes (CNEP), that learns to assign demonstrations from different modes to distinct expert networks utilizing the inherent information within the latent space to match experts with the encoded representations. CNEP does not require supervision on which mode the trajectories belong to. We compare the performance of CNEP against widely used and powerful LfD methods such as Gaussian Mixture Models, Probabilistic Movement Primitives, and Stable Movement Primitives and show that our method outperforms these baselines on multimodal trajectory datasets. The results reveal enhanced modeling performance for movement primitives, leading to the synthesis of trajectories that more accurately reflect those demonstrated by experts, particularly when the skill demonstrations include intersection points from various trajectories. We evaluated the CNEP model on two real-robot tasks, namely obstacle avoidance and pick-and-place tasks, that require the robot to learn multi-modal motion trajectories and execute the correct primitives given target environment conditions. We also showed that our system is capable of on-the-fly adaptation to environmental changes via an online conditioning mechanism. Lastly, we believe that CNEP offers improved explainability and interpretability by autonomously finding discrete behavior primitives and providing probability values about its expert selection decisions."}

However, it is known that ICL is very sensitive to the choice of training examples: randomly sampling examples from a training set leads to high variance in performance. In this paper, we show that carefully curating a subset of training data greatly stabilizes ICL performance without any other changes to the ICL algorithm (e.g., prompt retrieval or calibration). We introduce two methods to choose training subsets -- both score training examples individually, then select the highest-scoring ones. CondAcc scores a training example by its average dev-set ICL accuracy when combined with random training examples, while Datamodels learns linear regressors that estimate how the presence of each training example influences LLM outputs. Across five tasks and two LLMs, sampling from stable subsets selected by CondAcc and Datamodels improves average accuracy over sampling from the entire training set by 7.7% and 6.3%, respectively. Surprisingly, the stable subset examples are not especially diverse in content or low in perplexity, in contrast with other work suggesting that diversity and perplexity are important when prompting LLMs."}

We propose a new method called In-Context Reflection (ICR) to overcome these challenges. ICR strategically selects demonstrations to reduce the discrepancy between the LLM's outputs and the actual input-output mappings. Specifically, ICR starts with a random set of initial demonstrations, then iteratively refines it. In each step, it analyzes a pool of candidate examples and identifies the ones most likely to challenge the LLM's current understanding, measured by a new metric called misconfidence. These most confusing examples are then selected to replace the less informative demonstrations in the current set. Our comprehensive evaluation across five diverse datasets encompassing 13 subtasks shows the efficacy of ICR. Compared to existing methods, ICR achieves an average performance boost of 4%, while demonstrating remarkable cross-task generalization capabilities."}

In this paper, we propose a Guideline Learning (GL) framework for In-context IE which reflectively learns and follows guidelines.

Rethinking How Large Language Models Respond and Solve Tasks via In-Context Learning", "abstract": "In-context Learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful capability alongside the development of scaled-up large language models (LLMs). By instructing LLMs using few-shot demonstrative examples, ICL enables them to perform a wide range of tasks without updating millions of parameters. However, the precise contributions of demonstrations towards improving end-task performance have not been thoroughly investigated in recent analytical studies. In this paper, we empirically decompose the overall performance of ICL into three dimensions, label space, format, and discrimination, and we evaluate four general-purpose LLMs across a diverse range of tasks. Counter-intuitively, we find that the demonstrations have a marginal impact on provoking discriminative knowledge of language models. However, ICL exhibits significant efficacy in regulating the label space and format, which helps LLMs respond to desired label words. We then demonstrate that this ability functions similar to detailed instructions for LLMs to follow. We additionally provide an in-depth analysis of the mechanism of retrieval helping with ICL. Our findings demonstrate that retrieving the semantically similar examples notably boosts the model's discriminative capability. However, we also observe a trade-off in selecting good in-context examples regarding label diversity."}

Although there have been extensive studies on English in-context learning, multilingual in-context learning remains under-explored, and we lack an in-depth understanding of the role of demonstrations in this context. To address this gap, we conduct a multidimensional analysis of multilingual in-context learning, experimenting with 5 models from different model families, 9 datasets covering classification and generation tasks, and 56 typologically diverse languages. Our results reveal that the effectiveness of demonstrations varies significantly across models, tasks, and languages. We also find that strong instruction-following models including Llama 2-Chat, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 are largely insensitive to the quality of demonstrations. Instead, a carefully crafted template often eliminates the benefits of demonstrations for some tasks and languages altogether. These findings show that the importance of demonstrations might be overestimated. Our work highlights the need for granular evaluation across multiple axes towards a better understanding of in-context learning."}

While it has been widely studied in NLP, it is still a relatively new area of research in computer vision. To reveal the factors influencing the performance of visual in-context learning, this paper shows that prompt selection and prompt fusion are two major factors that have a direct impact on the inference performance of visual context learning. Prompt selection is the process of identifying the most appropriate prompt or example to help the model understand new tasks. This is important because providing the model with relevant prompts can help it learn more effectively and efficiently. Prompt fusion involves combining knowledge from different positions within the large-scale visual model. By doing this, the model can leverage the diverse knowledge stored in different parts of the model to improve its performance on new tasks. Based these findings, we propose a simple framework prompt-SelF for visual in-context learning. Specifically, we first use the pixel-level retrieval method to select a suitable prompt, and then use different prompt fusion methods to activate all the knowledge stored in the large-scale model, and finally ensemble the prediction results obtained from different prompt fusion methods to obtain the final prediction results. And we conduct extensive experiments on single-object segmentation and detection tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of prompt-SelF. Remarkably, the prompt-SelF has outperformed OSLSM based meta-learning in 1-shot segmentation for the first time. This indicated the great potential of visual in-context learning.

Complementary and alternative to supervised machine learning approaches, unsupervised physics-based methods based on behavior-driven theories hold great promise. Due to computational limitations, practical application on real-world domain science problems has lagged far behind theoretical development. We present our first step towards bridging this divide - DisCo - a high-performance distributed workflow for the behavior-driven local causal state theory. DisCo provides a scalable unsupervised physics-based representation learning method that decomposes spatiotemporal systems into their structurally relevant components, which are captured by the latent local causal state variables. Complex spatiotemporal systems are generally highly structured and organize around a lower-dimensional skeleton of coherent structures, and in several firsts we demonstrate the efficacy of DisCo in capturing such structures from observational and simulated scientific data. To the best of our knowledge, DisCo is also the first application software developed entirely in Python to scale to over 1000 machine nodes, providing good performance along with ensuring domain scientists' productivity. We developed scalable, performant methods optimized for Intel many-core processors that will be upstreamed to open-source Python library packages. Our capstone experiment, using newly developed DisCo workflow and libraries, performs unsupervised spacetime segmentation analysis of CAM5.1 climate simulation data, processing an unprecedented 89.5 TB in 6.6 minutes end-to-end using 1024 Intel Haswell nodes on the Cori supercomputer obtaining 91% weak-scaling and 64% strong-scaling efficiency."}

Both spatial and temporal contextual information play a critical role in the domain of visual recognition. Here we investigate spatial constraints (what image features provide contextual information and where they are located), and temporal constraints (when different contextual cues matter) for visual recognition. The task is to reason about the scene context and infer what a target object hidden behind a flap is in a natural image. To tackle this problem, we first describe an online human psychophysics experiment recording active sampling via mouse clicks in lift-the-flap games and identify clicking patterns and features which are diagnostic for high contextual reasoning accuracy. As a proof of the usefulness of these clicking patterns and visual features, we extend a state-of-the-art recurrent model capable of attending to salient context regions, dynamically integrating useful information, making inferences, and predicting class label for the target object over multiple clicks. The proposed model achieves human-level contextual reasoning accuracy, shares human-like sampling behavior and learns interpretable features for contextual reasoning."}

In ICL, a decision on a new input is made via a direct mapping of the input and of a few examples from the given task, serving as the task's context, to the output variable. No explicit updates of the model parameters are needed to tailor the decision to a new task. Pre-training, which amounts to a form of meta-learning, is based on the observation of examples from several related tasks. Prior work has shown ICL capabilities for linear regression. In this study, we leverage ICL to address the inverse problem of multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) equalization based on a context given by pilot symbols. A task is defined by the unknown fading channel and by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) level, which may be known. To highlight the practical potential of the approach, we allow the presence of quantization of the received signals. We demonstrate via numerical results that transformer-based ICL has a threshold behavior, whereby, as the number of pre-training tasks grows, the performance switches from that of a minimum mean squared error (MMSE) equalizer with a prior determined by the pre-trained tasks to that of an MMSE equalizer with the true data-generating prior."}

However, the current model's overdependence on function data overlooks the invaluable human insight into the operator. To address this, we present a transformation of in-context operator learning into a multi-modal paradigm. In particular, we take inspiration from the recent success of large language models, and propose using \"captions\" to integrate human knowledge about the operator, expressed through natural language descriptions and equations. Also, we introduce a novel approach to train a language-model-like architecture, or directly fine-tune existing language models, for in-context operator learning. We beat the baseline on single-modal learning tasks, and also demonstrated the effectiveness of multi-modal learning in enhancing performance and reducing function data requirements. The proposed method not only significantly enhanced the development of the in-context operator learning paradigm, but also created a new path for the application of language models."}

However, the ability of in-context learning is not fully exploited because language models are not explicitly trained to learn in context. To this end, we propose PICL (Pre-training for In-Context Learning), a framework to enhance the language models' in-context learning ability by pre-training the model on a large collection of \"intrinsic tasks\" in the general plain-text corpus using the simple language modeling objective. PICL encourages the model to infer and perform tasks by conditioning on the contexts while maintaining task generalization of pre-trained models. We evaluate the in-context learning performance of the model trained with PICL on seven widely-used text classification datasets and the Super-NaturalInstrctions benchmark, which contains 100+ NLP tasks formulated to text generation. Our experiments show that PICL is more effective and task-generalizable than a range of baselines, outperforming larger language models with nearly 4x parameters.

Yet the mechanisms that underlie it are poorly understood. In this paper, we demonstrate that comparable ICL capabilities can be acquired by an alternative sequence prediction learning method using clone-structured causal graphs (CSCGs). Moreover, a key property of CSCGs is that, unlike transformer-based LLMs, they are {\\em interpretable}, which considerably simplifies the task of explaining how ICL works. Specifically, we show that it uses a combination of (a) learning template (schema) circuits for pattern completion, (b) retrieving relevant templates in a context-sensitive manner, and (c) rebinding of novel tokens to appropriate slots in the templates. We go on to marshall evidence for the hypothesis that similar mechanisms underlie ICL in LLMs. For example, we find that, with CSCGs as with LLMs, different capabilities emerge at different levels of overparameterization, suggesting that overparameterization helps in learning more complex template (schema) circuits. By showing how ICL can be achieved with small models and datasets, we open up a path to novel architectures, and take a vital step towards a more general understanding of the mechanics behind this important capability."}

However, despite the success of LLMs, there has been little understanding of how ICL learns the knowledge from the given prompts. In this paper, to make progress toward understanding the learning behaviour of ICL, we train the same LLMs with the same demonstration examples via ICL and supervised learning (SL), respectively, and investigate their performance under label perturbations (i.e., noisy labels and label imbalance) on a range of classification tasks. First, via extensive experiments, we find that gold labels have significant impacts on the downstream in-context performance, especially for large language models; however, imbalanced labels matter little to ICL across all model sizes. Second, when comparing with SL, we show empirically that ICL is less sensitive to label perturbations than SL, and ICL gradually attains comparable performance to SL as the model size increases."}

In this work, we follow the setting proposed in (Garg et al., 2022) to better understand the generality and limitations of in-context learning from the lens of the simple yet fundamental task of linear regression. The key question we aim to address is: Are transformers more adept than some natural and simpler architectures at performing in-context learning under varying distribution shifts? To compare transformers, we propose to use a simple architecture based on set-based Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). We find that both transformers and set-based MLPs exhibit in-context learning under in-distribution evaluations, but transformers more closely emulate the performance of ordinary least squares (OLS). Transformers also display better resilience to mild distribution shifts, where set-based MLPs falter. However, under severe distribution shifts, both models' in-context learning abilities diminish."}

The promise of ICL is that the LLM can adapt to perform the present task at a competitive or state-of-the-art level at a fraction of the cost. The ability of LLMs to perform tasks in this few-shot manner relies on their background knowledge of the task (or task priors). However, recent work has found that, unlike traditional learning, LLMs are unable to fully integrate information from demonstrations that contrast task priors. This can lead to performance saturation at suboptimal levels, especially for subjective tasks such as emotion recognition, where the mapping from text to emotions can differ widely due to variability in human annotations. In this work, we design experiments and propose measurements to explicitly quantify the consistency of proxies of LLM priors and their pull on the posteriors. We show that LLMs have strong yet inconsistent priors in emotion recognition that ossify their predictions. We also find that the larger the model, the stronger these effects become. Our results suggest that caution is needed when using ICL with larger LLMs for affect-centered tasks outside their pre-training domain and when interpreting ICL results."}

We present a cross-entropy difference (CED) method for selecting in-context demonstrations. Our method is based on the observation that the effectiveness of in-context demonstrations negatively correlates with the perplexity of the test example by a language model that was finetuned on that demonstration. We utilize parameter efficient finetuning to train small models on training data that are used for computing the cross-entropy difference between a test example and every candidate in-context demonstration. This metric is used to rank and select in-context demonstrations independently for each test input. We evaluate our method on a mix-domain dataset that combines 8 benchmarks, representing 4 text generation tasks, showing that CED for in-context demonstration selection can improve performance for a variety of LLMs."}

(b) What is a proper performance metric for ICL and what is the error rate? (c) How does the transformer architecture enable ICL? To answer these questions, we adopt a Bayesian view and formulate ICL as a problem of predicting the response corresponding to the current covariate, given a number of examples drawn from a latent variable model. To answer (a), we show that, without updating the neural network parameters, ICL implicitly implements the Bayesian model averaging algorithm, which is proven to be approximately parameterized by the attention mechanism. For (b), we analyze the ICL performance from an online learning perspective and establish a $\\mathcal{O}(1/T)$ regret bound for perfectly pretrained ICL, where $T$ is the number of examples in the prompt. To answer (c), we show that, in addition to encoding Bayesian model averaging via attention, the transformer architecture also enables a fine-grained statistical analysis of pretraining under realistic assumptions. In particular, we prove that the error of pretrained model is bounded by a sum of an approximation error and a generalization error, where the former decays to zero exponentially as the depth grows, and the latter decays to zero sublinearly with the number of tokens in the pretraining dataset. Our results provide a unified understanding of the transformer and its ICL ability with bounds on ICL regret, approximation, and generalization, which deepens our knowledge of these essential aspects of modern language models."}

The precise nature of LLM capabilities is often mysterious, and different prompts can elicit different capabilities through in-context learning. We propose a framework that enables us to analyze in-context learning dynamics to understand latent concepts underlying LLMs' behavioral patterns. This provides a more nuanced understanding than success-or-failure evaluation benchmarks, but does not require observing internal activations as a mechanistic interpretation of circuits would. Inspired by the cognitive science of human randomness perception, we use random binary sequences as context and study dynamics of in-context learning by manipulating properties of context data, such as sequence length.

However, recent work shows that in-context learners largely rely on their pre-trained knowledge, such as the sentiment of the labels, instead of learning new associations from the input. We argue that the commonly-used few-shot evaluation using a random selection of in-context demonstrations can not disentangle models' reliance on such biases, as most of the randomly-selected demonstrations do not present relations informative for prediction beyond exposing the task's input-output distribution. Therefore, to evaluate models' in-context learning ability independent of models' memory, we introduce a Concept-sharing few-shot learning method choosing the demonstrations that share an underlying concept with the predicted sample. We extract a set of such concepts from available human explanations and measure how much models can benefit from presenting these concepts in few-shot demonstrations. We find that most of the recent in-context learners can not consistently benefit from the demonstrated concepts, irrespective of the model size.

Building upon this hypothesis, we introduce an explicit heuristic-driven demonstration construction approach, which transforms the haphazard example selection process into a methodical method that emphasizes task heuristics. Additionally, inspired by the analogical reasoning of human, we propose the link-of-analogy prompting, which enables LLMs to process new situations by drawing analogies to known situations, enhancing their performance on unseen classes beyond limited ICL examples.

In-context learning contrasts with traditional in-weights learning of query-output relationships. What aspects of the training data distribution and architecture favor in-context vs in-weights learning? Recent work has shown that specific distributional properties inherent in language, such as burstiness, large dictionaries and skewed rank-frequency distributions, control the trade-off or simultaneous appearance of these two forms of learning. We first show that these results are recapitulated in a minimal attention-only network trained on a simplified dataset. In-context learning (ICL) is driven by the abrupt emergence of an induction head, which subsequently competes with in-weights learning. By identifying progress measures that precede in-context learning and targeted experiments, we construct a two-parameter model of an induction head which emulates the full data distributional dependencies displayed by the attention-based network. A phenomenological model of induction head formation traces its abrupt emergence to the sequential learning of three nested logits enabled by an intrinsic curriculum. We propose that the sharp transitions in attention-based networks arise due to a specific chain of multi-layer operations necessary to achieve ICL, which is implemented by nested nonlinearities sequentially learned during training."}

Furthermore, we observe that the prediction shift from \"foo\" to \"bar\" is due to the respective reduction and increase in these heads' attention scores at \"foo\" and \"bar\" positions. Therefore, we propose a hypothesis for ICL: in in-context heads, the value-output matrices extract label features, while the query-key matrices compute the similarity between the features at the last position and those at each label position. The query and key matrices can be considered as two towers that learn the similarity metric between the last position's features and each demonstration at label positions.

In this paper, we investigate the security concern of ICL from an adversarial perspective, focusing on the impact of demonstrations. We propose a novel attack method named advICL, which aims to manipulate only the demonstration without changing the input to mislead the models. Our results demonstrate that as the number of demonstrations increases, the robustness of in-context learning would decrease.
