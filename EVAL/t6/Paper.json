Many studies have shown that LLMs can perform a series of complex tasks through ICL, such as solving mathematical reasoning problems~cot. These strong abilities have been widely verified as emerging abilities for large language models~wei2022emergent. The key idea of in-context learning is to learn from analogy. Figure~fig:icl gives an example that describes how language models make decisions via ICL. First, ICL requires a few demonstration examples to form a prompt context. These examples are usually written in natural language templates. Then, ICL concatenates a query question and the piece of prompt context together to form the input, which is then fed into the language model for prediction. Different from supervised learning, which requires a training stage that uses backward gradients to update model parameters, ICL does not perform parameter updates. The model is expected to learn the pattern hidden in the demonstration and accordingly make the right prediction. % The inference is performed in the form of text completion by reusing the language model head learned during the large-scale pretraining. my-box=[ rectangle, draw=hidden-draw, rounded corners, text opacity=1, minimum height=1.5em, minimum width=5em, inner sep=2pt, align=center, fill opacity=.5, line width=0.8pt, ] leaf=[my-box, minimum height=1.5em, fill=hidden-pink!80, text=black, align=left,font=\\normalsize, inner xsep=2pt, inner ysep=4pt, line width=0.8pt, ] figure*[t!] -1.0cm \\centering \\textwidth{!}{ forest forked edges, for tree={ grow=east, reversed=true, anchor=base west, parent anchor=east, child anchor=west, base=left, font=\\large, rectangle, draw=hidden-draw, rounded corners, align=left, minimum width=4em, edge+={darkgray, line width=1pt}, s sep=3pt, inner xsep=2pt, inner ysep=3pt, line width=0.8pt, ver/.style={rotate=90, child anchor=north, parent anchor=south, anchor=center}, }, where level=1{text width=4em,font=\\normalsize,}{}, where level=2{text width=7.5em,font=\\normalsize,}{}, where level=3{text width=6.0em,font=\\normalsize,}{}, where level=4{text width=6.0em,font=\\normalsize,}{}, [ In-context Learning, ver [ Training, ver [ Pre-training (\\S sec:pretraining) [ PICL~picl{, }MEND~Li2023mend{, }ICLM~Shi2023iclm, leaf, text width=45.0em ] ] [ Warmup (\\S sec:warmup) [ MetaICL~metaicl{, }OPT-IML~optiml{, }Super-NaturalInstructions~natural{, }\\\\FLAN~flan{, }Scaling Instruction~chung{, }Self-supervised ICL~selfsupericl{, }\\\\Symbol Tuning~symboltuning{, }RICL~Chu2023Finetune {, }ICL Markup~Brunet2023Markup, leaf, text width=45.0em ] ] ] [ Inference, ver [ Demonstration\\\\ (\\S sec:demonstration_org) [ Selection \\\\ (\\S sec:select) [ Unsupervised [ KATE~liu2022close{, }SG-ICL~kim2022self{, }Self-Adaptive\\\\Wu2022SelfadaptiveIL{, }PPL~gonen2022demystifying{, }MI~sorensen2022information{, }\\\\Informative Score~li2023supporting{, }IDS~qin2023incontext{,}\\\\Votek~su2022selective , leaf, text width=29.7em ] ] [ Supervised [ EPR~rubin2022learning{, }Q-Learning~zhang2022active{, }\\\\AdaICL~mavromatis2023examples{, }Topic~topic{, }\\\\UDR~udr , leaf, text width=29.7em ] ] ] [ Reformatting \\\\ (\\S sec:reformatting) [ SG-ICL~kim2022self{, }Structrured Prompting~hao2022structured{, }\\\\AutoICL~yang2023autoicl{, }WICL~yang2023demonstration{, }ICV~liu2024incontext, leaf, text width=37.3em ] ] [ Ordering \\\\ (\\S sec:order) [ GlobalE\\&LocalE~lu2022order{,} ICCL~liu2024lets , leaf, text width=37.3em ] ] ] [ Instruction (\\S sec:instruction) [ Instruction Induction~induct{, }Self-Instruct~wang2022self{, }APE~zhou2022large{, }\\\\Grimoire~chen2024grimoire , leaf, text width=45.0em ] ] [ Scoring \\\\ Function (\\S sec:scoring) [ Calibrate~calibrate{, }Channel Models~min2022noisy{, }$k$NN-Prompting~knnPrompting, leaf, text width=45.0em ] ] ] [ Analysis, ver [ Influencing \\\\Factors (\\S sec:inf_factors) [ Pre-training \\\\Stage (\\S sec:inf_factors_pre) [Pre-Training\\\\ Data [Distribution~distribution,wies2024learnability{, }Domain\\\\shin2022corpora, Han2023UnderstandingIL{, }Diversity~Yadlowsky2023PretrainingDM, leaf, text width=29.6em ] ] [Model and\\\\Training [Architecture ~Ding2023CausalLMIN{, }Pre-training steps~wei2022emergent{, }\\\\Parameters~gpt3,wei2022emergent, leaf, text width=29.6em ] ] ] [ Inference\\\\ Stage (\\S sec:inf_factors_infe) [ Input Labels [ Mapping~ground_truth,Pan2023WhatIL,Tang2023LargeLM{, }\\\\Settings~min2022rethinking, leaf, text width=29.6em ] ] [Demonstration\\\\ Examples [Diversity and Simplicity~compositional_generalization{, }Query Similarity\\\\liu2022close, compositional_generalization{, }Feature bias~inductive_bias{, }\\\\Order~lu2022order, Zhang2022ActiveES,Liu2023LostIT, leaf, text width=29.6em ] ] ] ] [ Learning \\\\Mechanism (\\S sec:mech) [ Functional\\\\ Modules\\\\(\\S sec:mech_fun) [ Induction Heads~olsson2022induction, Bietti2023BirthOA {, }\\\\Computational Layers~label_anchor{, }Attention Modules~icl_weight_shifting, leaf, text width=37.3em ] ] [ Theoretical\\\\ Interpretation\\\\(\\Ssec:mech_theo) [ Bayesian Framework ~bayesian, topic, jiang2023latent{, }\\\\Gradient Descent~dai2022iclft, Irie2022TheDF, mahankali2023one{, }\\\\Others~garg2022linear, akyurek2022algorithm, trm_as_alg, tr_and_tl, leaf, text width=37.3em ] ] ] ] ] forest } Taxonomy of in-context learning. figure* As a new paradigm, ICL has multiple attractive advantages. %ICL opens new directions for natural language processing research. First, since the demonstration is written in natural language, it provides an interpretable interface to communicate with LLMs~gpt3. This paradigm makes it much easier to incorporate human knowledge into LLMs by changing the demonstration and templates~liu2022close, lu2022order, cot, Wu2022SelfadaptiveIL. Second, in-context learning is similar to the decision process of human beings by learning from analogy~winston1980learningByAnalogy. %, i.e., a human makes a prediction based on a few instructions and utilizes the experience from the past to generalize to new tasks.learning by analogy (ju yi fan san) Third, compared to supervised training, ICL is a training-free learning framework. %ICL is data-efficient This high data efficiency of ICL makes this paradigm more ideal than previous data-hungry tuning methods for low-resource applications and scenarios~calibrate. This could not only greatly reduce the computational costs for adapting the model to new tasks, but also make language-model-as-a-service~sun2022black possible and can be easily applied to large-scale real-world tasks. Despite being promising, there are also interesting questions and intriguing properties that require further investigation in ICL. Although a range of vanilla GPT models show excellent ICL capability, several studies have found that this capability can be significantly improved through adaptation during pretraining~metaicl, Li2023mend. Moreover, the performance of ICL is sensitive to specific settings, including the prompt template, the selection and order of demonstration examples, and other factors~topic, liu2024lets. Additionally, optimizing the conciseness of demonstration examples and improving the computational efficiency of ICL are critical areas of ongoing research~liu2024incontext. Furthermore, despite preliminary explanations~dai2022iclft, jiang2023latent, the underlying working mechanism of ICL remains unclear and requires further investigation. With the rapid growth of studies in ICL, our survey aims to sensitize the community toward the current progress. In the following sections, we delve into an in-depth discussion of related studies, and we summarize the taxonomy in Figure~taxo_of_icl and the key findings in Appendix~app:takeaway. We highlight the challenges and potential directions and hope our work provide a useful roadmap for beginners interested in this area and shed light on future research.",

      "level": "1",
      "content": "Following gpt3, we here provide a formal definition of in-context learning: quote In-context learning is a paradigm that allows language models to learn tasks given only a few examples in the form of demonstration. quote Formally, given a query input text $x$ and a set of candidate answers $Y = \\{y_1, \\ldots, y_m\\}$, a pretrained language model $M$ takes the candidate answer with the maximum score as the prediction,$Y$ could be class labels or a set of free-text phrases. conditioned a demonstration set $C$. $C$ contains an optional task instruction $I$ and $k$ demonstration examples, thus $C = \\{ I, s(x_1, y_1), \\ldots, s(x_k, y_k) \\}$ or $C = \\{ s^{\\prime}(x_1, y_1, I), \\ldots, s^{\\prime}(x_k, y_k, I) \\}$, where $s^{\\prime}(x_i, y_i, I)$ is an example written in natural language according to the task. Depending on whether $k$ and the demonstration examples belong to the same task, it can be categorized as task-specific ICL and cross-task ICL. In the latter, different examples have their own instructions. The likelihood of a candidate answer $y_j$ comes from a scoring function $f$ on the whole input sequence: equation P( y_j \\mid x) \\triangleq f_M ( y_j, C, x) equation The final predicted label $\\hat y$ is the candidate answer with the highest probability: equation \\hat y = \\arg\\max_{y_j \\in Y } P(y_j \\mid x). equation According to the definition, we can see that ICL differs from related concepts as follows: (1) Prompt Learning: prompts can be discrete templates or soft parameters that encourage the model to predict the desired output. ICL can be regarded as a subclass of prompt tuning where the demonstration examples are part of the prompt. liu2021pre made a thorough survey on prompt learning, but ICL was not included in their study. (2) Few-shot Learning: few-shot learning is a general machine learning approach that involves adapting model parameters to perform a task with a limited number of supervised examples~wang2019few. In contrast, ICL does not require parameter updates and is directly performed on pretrained LLMs.",

As most pretraining data are not tailored for ICL~selfsupericl, researchers have introduced various warmup strategies to bridge the gap between pretraining and ICL inference. Both metaicl and natural proposed to continually finetune LLMs on a broad range of tasks with multiple demonstration examples, which boosts ICL abilities. To encourage the model to learn input-label mappings from the context, symboltuning proposed symbol tuning, which substitutes natural language labels (e.g., ``positive/negative sentiment'') with arbitrary symbols (e.g., ``foo/bar''). selfsupericl proposed a self-supervised method to align raw text with ICL formats in downstream tasks. Besides, multiple studies have indicated the potential value of instructions~mishra2021cross, flan. Tuning the 137B LaMDA-PT~lamda on over 60 datasets verbalized via natural language instruction templates, FLAN~flan improves the ability of LLMs to follow instructions, boosting both the zero-shot and few-shot ICL performance. chung and natural proposed to further scale up instruction tuning with more than 1000+ task instructions.",

      "level": "3",
      "content": "Demonstrations selection aims to answer a fundamental question: Which samples are good examples for ICL? We categorize the related studies into two approaches: unsupervised methods based on predefined metrics and supervised methods. Unsupervised Method A straightforward approach to selecting ICL examples is to choose the nearest neighbors of input instances based on their similarities~liu2022close, tanwar2023multilingual, qin2023incontext. Distance metrics, such as L2 distance or cosine similarity based on sentence embeddings, are commonly used for this purpose. For example, liu2022close proposed KATE, the first $k$NN-based unsupervised retriever for selecting in-context examples. Similarly, $k$-NN cross-lingual demonstrations can be retrieved for multi-lingual ICL to strengthen source-target language alignment~tanwar2023multilingual. su2022selective proposed to combine graphs and confidence scores to select diverse and representative examples. In addition to distance metrics, mutual information~sorensen2022information and perplexity~gonen2022demystifying have proven valuable for prompt selection without labeled examples or specific LLMs. Furthermore, using output scores of LLMs as unsupervised metrics has shown effectiveness in demonstration selection~Wu2022SelfadaptiveIL, nguyen2023influence, li2023supporting. Particularly, Wu2022SelfadaptiveIL selected the best subset permutation of $k$NN examples based on the code length for data transmission to compress label $y$ given $x$ and $C$. li2023supporting used infoscore, i.e., the average of $P(y|x_i,y_i,x) P(y|x)$ for all $(x,y)$ pairs in a validation set with a diversity regularization. %These methods collectively push the boundaries of how in-context examples are optimized to enhance the efficacy of model inference. Supervised Method Though off-the-shelf retrievers offer convenient services for extensive NLP tasks, they are heuristic and sub-optimal due to the lack of task-specific supervision. To address this issue, numerous supervised methods have been developed~rubin2022learning, ye2023compositional, topic, zhang2022active. EPR~rubin2022learning introduced a two-stage method to train a dense retriever for demonstration selection. For a specific input, it first utilized unsupervised methods (e.g., BM25) to recall similar examples as candidates and then used this data to build a supervised dense retriever. Following EPR, udr adopted a unified demonstration retriever to select demonstrations across different tasks. Unlike prior work that retrieves individual demonstrations, ye2023compositional proposed retrieving entire demonstration sets to model inter-relationships between examples. Additionally, mavromatis2023examples introduced AdaICL, a model-adaptive method that employs LLM to predict the unlabeled data set, generating an uncertainty score for each instance. Based on prompt tuning, topic viewed LLMs as topic models that can infer concepts $\\theta$ from a few demonstrations and generate tokens based on these concepts. They represent latent concepts with task-related concept tokens, which are learned to maximize $P(y|x,\\theta)$. Demonstrations are selected based on their likelihood to infer the concept variable using $P(\\theta|x,y)$. Additionally, reinforcement learning was introduced by zhang2022active for example selection. They formulated demonstration selection as a Markov decision process~bellman1957markovian and selected demonstrations via Q-learning. The action is choosing an example, and the reward is defined as the accuracy of a labeled validation set. In order to have a more intuitive comparison of the performance of several unsupervised methods, we select topk~liu2022close, votek~su2022selective, mdl~Wu2022SelfadaptiveIL to conduct experiments. The result is shown in Table 2. The details of the experiment can be found in Appendix app:experiment.",

For instance, kim2022self proposed generating demonstrations directly from LLMs to reduce the reliance on external demonstration data. Structured Prompting hao2022structured proposed to encode demonstration examples separately with special positional embeddings, which are then provided to the test examples using a rescaled attention mechanism. Diverging from these methods, other approaches focus on modifying the latent representation of demonstrations~liu2024incontext, li2024featureadaptive. Specifically, liu2024incontext developed In-Context Vectors (ICVs) derived from the latent embeddings of demonstration examples in LLMs. These ICVs are used during inference to adjust the latent states of the LLM, thereby enhancing the model's ability to follow the demonstrations more effectively.",

Consequently, they utilized the entropy metric to determine the optimal demonstration ordering.

Although template engineering has been studied in prompting~liu2021pre, some researchers aim to design a better format of demonstrations for ICL by describing tasks with the instruction $I$. induct found that given several demonstration examples, LLMs can generate task instructions themselves. Considering the generation abilities of LLMs, zhou2022large proposed an Automatic Prompt Engineer for automatic instruction generation and selection. To further improve the quality of the automatically generated instructions, several strategies have proposed using LLMs to bootstrap off its own generations~wang2022self, chen2024grimoire.

The Direct method uses the conditional probability of candidate answers represented by tokens in the model's vocabulary gpt3. The answer with the highest probability is selected as the final answer, but this method restricts template design by requiring answer tokens to be at the end of input sequences. Perplexity (PPL) is another commonly used metric that computes the sentence perplexity of the entire input sequence \\( S_j = \\{ C, s(x, y_j, I) \\} \\), which includes tokens from demonstration examples \\( C \\), the input query \\( x \\), and the candidate label \\( y_j \\). PPL evaluates the probability of the sentence, eliminating token position limitations but requiring additional computation time. min2022noisy proposed using channel models (Channel) to compute the conditional probability in reverse, estimating the likelihood of the input query given the label. This approach requires language models to generate every token in the input, potentially boosting performance under imbalanced training data. We summarize all three scoring functions in Table~tab:score_func. Note that in Table~tab:score_func, `Efficiency' refers to the language model inference latency; `Coverage' reflects whether the method utilizes the output probability of the local or all token positions in the input sequence; and `Stability' indicates whether the in-context learning ability is easily affected by changes in the demonstration examples.",

Similarly, Raventos2023PretrainingTD empirically identified a task diversity threshold beyond which LLMs exhibit strong ICL capabilities in unseen tasks. Another line of research investigates the impact of data distribution on ICL~distribution, wies2024learnability. For instance, distribution demonstrated that ICL capability emerges when the training data exhibits specific distributional properties, such as burstiness, wherein items appear in clusters rather than being uniformly distributed over time. Beyond these works, several studies have investigated the impact of model architecture and training process on ICL performance~wei2022emergent, gpt3, Ding2023CausalLMIN. wei2022emergent investigated the emergent abilities of many large-scale models on multiple tasks. They suggested that a pretrained model acquires some emergent ICL abilities when it reaches a large scale of pretraining steps or model parameters. Ding2023CausalLMIN pointed out that the in-context samples should attend to each other during inference, indicating that current causal LLMs may lead to suboptimal ICL performance.",

      "content": "During inference, there are also multiple properties of demonstration examples that influence ICL performance. min2022rethinking proved that input-label settings such as the pairing format, the exposure of label space, and the input distribution contribute substantially to ICL performance. However, contrary to the conclusion in min2022rethinking that input-label mapping matters little to ICL, latter studies showed that the accurate mapping influence ICL performance significantly~ground_truth, Pan2023WhatIL, Tang2023LargeLM. llm_icl_differently further pointed that flipped or semantically-unrelated input-label mapping also can be learned. From the perspective of demonstration construction, recent literature focuses on the diversity and simplicity of demonstrations~compositional_generalization, the order of samples~lu2022order, Zhang2022ActiveES, Liu2023LostIT, and the similarity between demonstrations and queries~liu2022close. For example, liu2022close found that demonstration samples with embeddings closer to those of the query samples typically yield better performance than those with more distant embeddings. Notably, despite efforts to refine demonstrations to optimize the performance, there still remain clear feature biases during ICL inference~inductive_bias. Overcoming strong prior biases and ensuring the model gives equal weight to all contextual information remain challenges~Kossen2023InContextLL.",

Particularly, olsson2022induction identified specific attention heads, referred to as ``induction heads'', that can replicate previous patterns for next-token prediction, thus progressively developing ICL capabilities.

      "section_title": "Theoretical Interpretation",
      "level": "3",
      "content": "In this subsection, we introduce the theoretical interpretations of ICL from different views. Bayesian View In the Bayesian framework, ICL is explained as implicit Bayesian inference, where models perform ICL by identifying a shared latent concept among examples~bayesian,wies2024learnability,ahuja2023context,jiang2023latent,topic. Additional perspectives suggest that LLMs encode the Bayesian Model Averaging algorithm via the attention mechanism~zhang2023and. As the number of in-context examples increases, implicit Bayesian inference becomes analogous to kernel regression~Han2023ExplainingEI. Gradient Descent View Gradient descent offers another valuable lens for understanding ICL. ~dai2022iclft identified a dual form between Transformer attention and gradient descent, finding that GPT-based ICL behaves similarly to explicit fine-tuning from multiple perspectives. Other studies have attempted to establish connections between ICL and gradient descent in simplified regression settings~icl_gd, Ahn2023TransformersLT, mahankali2023one, icl_weight_shifting. For instance, icl_gd showed that linear attention-only Transformers with manually constructed parameters are closely related to models learned by gradient descent. icl_weight_shifting found that self-attention-only Transformers exhibit similarities with models trained via gradient descent. However, the simplified settings used in these studies have led to debates about the direct applicability of these connections in real-world contexts~Shen2023RevisitingTH. fu2023transformers argued that Transformers perform ICL on linear regression using higher-order optimization techniques rather than gradient descent. Other Views Beyond connecting ICL with a single algorithm, researchers have analyzed it from various perspectives, including ability decoupling, algorithmic learning, and information theory. tr_and_tl decoupled ICL capabilities into task recognition ability and task learning ability, each manifesting under different conditions. Another typical theory abstracts ICL as an algorithmic learning problem~akyurek2022algorithm, garg2022linear, trm_as_alg, Bai2023TransformersAS, where Transformers dynamically select algorithms, such as gradient descent and ridge regression, tailored to different ICL instances. Moreover, implicit_structure_induction utilized information theory to show an error bound for ICL under linguistically motivated assumptions, explaining how next-token prediction can bring about the ICL ability. These analytical studies have taken an essential step to explain ICL. However, most of them focused on simple tasks and small models. Extending analysis on extensive tasks and large models may be the next step to be considered.",

      "content": "Given its user-friendly interface and lightweight prompting method, ICL has broad applications on traditional NLP tasks~kim2022self,metaicl,zhu2023multilingual. Particularly, by using demonstrations that explicitly guide the reasoning process, ICL manifests remarkable effects on tasks requiring complex reasoning~cot,li2023code,teachalgo and compositional generalization~least. We explore several emerging and prevalent applications of ICL, including data engineering, model augmentation, and knowledge updating. 1) Data Engineering: Unlike traditional methods such as human annotation and noisy automatic annotation, ICL generates relatively high-quality data at a lower cost, leading to improved performance.~want, khorashadizadeh2023exploring, annotation. 2) Model Augmentation: The context-flexible nature of ICL shows promise in model augmentation. It can enhance retrieval-augmented methods by prepending grounding documents to the input~ram2023context. Additionally, ICL for retrieval demonstrates potential in steering models toward safer outputs~dpicl, meade2023using. 3) Knowledge Updating: LLMs often contain outdated or incorrect knowledge~NEURIPS2023_5f0a4cd2. ICL has demonstrated efficacy in revising such knowledge through carefully crafted demonstrations, yielding higher success rates compared to gradient-based methods~editingfact. As mentioned above, ICL has yielded significant benefits on both traditional and emergent NLP applications. The tremendous success of ICL in NLP has inspired researchers to explore its potential in various modalities beyond text (elaborated in Appendix~app:vision), including vision ~bar2022visual_icl,wang2023imagesPainter, vision-language~tsimpoukelli2021frozen, alayrac2022flamingo, as well as speech applications~wang2023neural,zhang2023valle-x.",

      "level": "1",
      "content": "In this section, we review existing challenges and discuss future directions for ICL. Efficiency and Scalability The use of demonstrations in ICL introduces two challenges: (1) higher computational costs with an increasing number of demonstrations (efficiency), and (2) fewer learnable samples due to the maximum input length of LLMs (scalability). Prior research has attempted to mitigate these issues by distilling lengthy demonstrations into compact vectors~Li2024ImplicitIL,Li2023mend or expediting LLM inference times~Liu2023dejavu. However, these methods often involve a trade-off in performance or necessitate access to model parameters, which is impractical for closed-source models like ChatGPT and Claude~Zhou2023Efficient. Thus, enhancing the scalability and efficiency of ICL with more demonstrations remains a significant challenge. Generalization ICL heavily relies on high-quality demonstrations selected from annotated examples, which are often scarce in low-resource languages and tasks. This scarcity poses a challenge to the generalization ability of ICL~He2024SelfDemos. Given that there is a substantial discrepancy in the availability of annotated high-resource data and low-resource data, the potential to leverage high-resource data to address low-resource tasks is highly appealing~Chatterjee2024LanguageMC, tanwar2023multilingual. Long-context ICL Recent advances in context-extended LLMs have spurred research into the impact of ICL when using an increasing number of demonstration examples~agarwal2024manyshot,Bertsch2024InContextLW. However, researchers have found that increasing the number of demonstrations does not necessarily enhance performance and may even be detrimental. These performance declines indicate a need for further investigation. Additionally, Li2024LongcontextLS developed LongICLBench, which includes diverse extreme-label classification tasks, revealing further weaknesses of LLMs in comprehending extended demonstrations.",
