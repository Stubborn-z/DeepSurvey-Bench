Various methods, so far, have been developed to conduct CSI estimation. However, they usually require high computational complexity, which makes them unsuitable for 5G wireless communications due to employing many new techniques (e.g., massive MIMO, OFDM, and millimeter-Wave (mmWave)). In this paper, we propose an efficient online CSI prediction scheme, called OCEAN, for predicting CSI from historical data in 5G wireless communication systems. Specifically, we first identify several important features affecting the CSI of a radio link and a data sample consists of the information of the features and the CSI. We then design a learning framework that is an integration of a CNN (convolutional neural network) and a long short term with memory (LSTM) network. We also further develop an offline-online two-step training mechanism, enabling the prediction results to be more stable when applying it to practical 5G wireless communication systems. To validate OCEAN's efficacy, we consider four typical case studies, and conduct extensive experiments in the four scenarios, i.e., two outdoor and two indoor scenarios.

{"title": "A survey of large language models", "abstract": "Language is essentially a complex, intricate system of human expressions governed by grammatical rules. It poses a significant challenge to develop capable AI algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language. As a major approach, language modeling has been widely studied for language understanding and generation in the past two decades, evolving from statistical language models to neural language models. Recently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been proposed by pre-training Transformer models over large-scale corpora, showing strong capabilities in solving various NLP tasks. Since researchers have found that model scaling can lead to performance improvement, they further study the scaling effect by increasing the model size to an even larger size. Interestingly, when the parameter scale exceeds a certain level, these enlarged language models not only achieve a significant performance improvement but also show some special abilities that are not present in small-scale language models. To discriminate the difference in parameter scale, the research community has coined the term large language models (LLM) for the PLMs of significant size. Recently, the research on LLMs has been largely advanced by both academia and industry, and a remarkable progress is the launch of ChatGPT, which has attracted widespread attention from society. The technical evolution of LLMs has been making an important impact on the entire AI community, which would revolutionize the way how we develop and use AI algorithms.

{"title": "Vision-aided 6G wireless communications: Blockage prediction and proactive handoff", "abstract": "The sensitivity to blockages is a key challenge for millimeter wave and terahertz networks in 5G and beyond. Since these networks mainly rely on line-of-sight (LOS) links, sudden link blockages highly threaten the reliability of the networks. Further, when the LOS link is blocked, the network typically needs to hand off the user to another LOS basestation, which may incur critical time latency, especially if a search over a large codebook of narrow beams is needed. A promising way to tackle the reliability and latency challenges lies in enabling proaction in wireless networks. Proaction allows the network to anticipate future blockages, especially dynamic blockages, and initiate user hand-off beforehand. This article presents a complete machine learning framework for enabling proaction in wireless networks relying on visual data captured, for example, by red-green-blue (RGB) cameras deployed at the base stations. In particular, the article proposes a vision-aided wireless communication solution that utilizes bimodal machine learning to perform proactive blockage prediction and user hand-off. This is mainly achieved via a deep learning algorithm that learns from visual and wireless data how to predict incoming blockages. The predictions of this algorithm are used by the wireless network to proactively initiate hand-off decisions and avoid any unnecessary latency. The algorithm is developed on a vision-wireless dataset generated using the ViWi data-generation framework. Experimental results on two basestations with different cameras indicate that the algorithm is capable of accurately detecting incoming blockages more than ${\\sim} 90\\%$ of the time.

{"title": "The perils of trial-and-error reward design: misdesign through overfitting and invalid task specifications", "abstract": "In reinforcement learning (RL), a reward function that aligns exactly with a task's true performance metric is often necessarily sparse. For example, a true task metric might encode a reward of 1 upon success and 0 otherwise. The sparsity of these true task metrics can make them hard to learn from, so in practice they are often replaced with alternative dense reward functions. These dense reward functions are typically designed by experts through an ad hoc process of trial and error. In this process, experts manually search for a reward function that improves performance with respect to the task metric while also enabling an RL algorithm to learn faster. This process raises the question of whether the same reward function is optimal for all algorithms, i.e., whether the reward function can be overfit to a particular algorithm. In this paper, we study the consequences of this wide yet unexamined practice of trial-and-error reward design. We first conduct computational experiments that confirm that reward functions can be overfit to learning algorithms and their hyperparameters. We then conduct a controlled observation study which emulates expert practitioners' typical experiences of reward design, in which we similarly find evidence of reward function overfitting. We also find that experts' typical approach to reward design---of adopting a myopic strategy and weighing the relative goodness of each state-action pair---leads to misdesign through invalid task specifications, since RL algorithms use cumulative reward rather than rewards for individual state-action pairs as an optimization target.\n\nCode, data: github.com/serenabooth/reward-design-perils", "arxivid": ""}

However, recent efforts on LLMs for wireless networks are limited to a direct application of existing language models that were designed for natural language processing (NLP) applications. To address this challenge and create wireless-centric foundation models, this paper presents a comprehensive vision on how to design universal foundation models that are tailored towards the unique needs of next-generation wireless systems, thereby paving the way towards the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI)-native networks. Diverging from NLP-based foundation models, the proposed framework promotes the design of large multi-modal models (LMMs) fostered by three key capabilities: 1) processing of multi-modal sensing data, 2) grounding of physical symbol representations in real-world wireless systems using causal reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and 3) enabling instructibility from the wireless environment feedback to facilitate dynamic network adaptation thanks to logical and mathematical reasoning facilitated by neuro-symbolic AI. In essence, these properties enable the proposed LMM framework to build universal capabilities that cater to various cross-layer networking tasks and alignment of intents across different domains. Preliminary results from experimental evaluation demonstrate the efficacy of grounding using RAG in LMMs, and showcase the alignment of LMMs with wireless system designs. Furthermore, the enhanced rationale exhibited in the responses to mathematical questions by LMMs, compared to vanilla LLMs, demonstrates the logical and mathematical reasoning capabilities inherent in LMMs. Building on those results, we present a sequel of open questions and challenges for LMMs. We then conclude with a set of recommendations that ignite the path towards LMM-empowered AI-native systems.", "arxivid": "2402.01748v2"}

Our approach leverages this proxy reward function in an RL framework. Specifically, users specify a prompt once at the beginning of training. During training, the LLM evaluates an RL agent's behavior against the desired behavior described by the prompt and outputs a corresponding reward signal. The RL agent then uses this reward to update its behavior.

Developing this approach, we find that large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 can surprisingly zero-shot extrapolate time series at a level comparable to or exceeding the performance of purpose-built time series models trained on the downstream tasks. To facilitate this performance, we propose procedures for effectively tokenizing time series data and converting discrete distributions over tokens into highly flexible densities over continuous values. We argue the success of LLMs for time series stems from their ability to naturally represent multimodal distributions, in conjunction with biases for simplicity, and repetition, which align with the salient features in many time series, such as repeated seasonal trends. We also show how LLMs can naturally handle missing data without imputation through non-numerical text, accommodate textual side information, and answer questions to help explain predictions. While we find that increasing model size generally improves performance on time series, we show GPT-4 can perform worse than GPT-3 because of how it tokenizes numbers, and poor uncertainty calibration, which is likely the result of alignment interventions such as RLHF.", "arxivid": "2310.07820v3"}

While pre-trained foundation models have made impressive strides in NLP and CV, their development in time series domains has been constrained by data sparsity. Recent studies have revealed that large language models (LLMs) possess robust pattern recognition and reasoning abilities over complex sequences of tokens.

However, existing studies mainly focus on simulating human dialogue. Human non-verbal behaviors, such as item clicking in recommender systems, although implicitly exhibiting user preferences and could enhance the modeling of users, have not been deeply explored. The main reasons lie in the gap between language modeling and behavior modeling, as well as the incomprehension of LLMs about user-item relations. To address this issue, we propose AgentCF for simulating user-item interactions in recommender systems through agent-based collaborative filtering. We creatively consider not only users but also items as agents, and develop a collaborative learning approach that optimizes both kinds of agents together. Specifically, at each time step, we first prompt the user and item agents to interact autonomously. Then, based on the disparities between the agents' decisions and real-world interaction records, user and item agents are prompted to reflect on and adjust the misleading simulations collaboratively, thereby modeling their two-sided relations. The optimized agents can also propagate their preferences to other agents in subsequent interactions, implicitly capturing the collaborative filtering idea. Overall, the optimized agents exhibit diverse interaction behaviors within our framework, including user-item, user-user, item-item, and collective interactions.

A significant number of BIG-bench tasks showed discontinuous improvements from model scale, meaning that performance steeply increased as we scaled to our largest model. PaLM also has strong capabilities in multilingual tasks and source code generation, which we demonstrate on a wide array of benchmarks.

ZeRO eliminates memory redundancies in data- and model-parallel training while retaining low communication volume and high computational granularity, allowing us to scale the model size proportional to the number of devices with sustained high efficiency.

While one could use a development set to determine which permutations are performant, this would deviate from the true few-shot setting as it requires additional annotated data.

Without modifying a large language model's weights, it can be tuned to perform various downstream natural language tasks simply by including concatenated training examples of these tasks in its input. Though disruptive for many practical applications of large language models, this emergent learning paradigm is not well understood from a theoretical perspective. In this paper, we propose a first-of-its-kind PAC based framework for in-context learnability, and use it to provide the first finite sample complexity results for the in-context learning setup. Our framework includes an initial pretraining phase, which fits a function to the pretraining distribution, and then a second in-context learning phase, which keeps this function constant and concatenates training examples of the downstream task in its input. We use our framework in order to prove that, under mild assumptions, when the pretraining distribution is a mixture of latent tasks (a model often considered for natural language pretraining), these tasks can be efficiently learned via in-context learning, even though the model's weights are unchanged and the input significantly diverges from the pretraining distribution. Our theoretical analysis reveals that in this setting, in-context learning is more about identifying the task than about learning it, a result which is in line with a series of recent empirical findings.

In this paper, we suggest that training Transformers on auto-regressive objectives is closely related to gradient-based meta-learning formulations. We start by providing a simple weight construction that shows the equivalence of data transformations induced by 1) a single linear self-attention layer and by 2) gradient-descent (GD) on a regression loss. Motivated by that construction, we show empirically that when training self-attention-only Transformers on simple regression tasks either the models learned by GD and Transformers show great similarity or, remarkably, the weights found by optimization match the construction. Thus we show how trained Transformers become mesa-optimizers i.e. learn models by gradient descent in their forward pass. This allows us, at least in the domain of regression problems, to mechanistically understand the inner workings of in-context learning in optimized Transformers. Building on this insight, we furthermore identify how Transformers surpass the performance of plain gradient descent by learning an iterative curvature correction and learn linear models on deep data representations to solve non-linear regression tasks. Finally, we discuss intriguing parallels to a mechanism identified to be crucial for in-context learning termed induction-head (Olsson et al., 2022) and show how it could be understood as a specific case of in-context learning by gradient descent learning within Transformers.

We investigate two setups-ICL with flipped labels and ICL with semantically-unrelated labels-across various model families (GPT-3, InstructGPT, Codex, PaLM, and Flan-PaLM). First, experiments on ICL with flipped labels show that overriding semantic priors is an emergent ability of model scale. While small language models ignore flipped labels presented in-context and thus rely primarily on semantic priors from pretraining, large models can override semantic priors when presented with in-context exemplars that contradict priors, despite the stronger semantic priors that larger models may hold. We next study semantically-unrelated label ICL (SUL-ICL), in which labels are semantically unrelated to their inputs (e.g., foo/bar instead of negative/positive), thereby forcing language models to learn the input-label mappings shown in in-context exemplars in order to perform the task. The ability to do SUL-ICL also emerges primarily with scale, and large-enough language models can even perform linear classification in a SUL-ICL setting.

To surmount these challenges, we introduce a new framework for language model inference, Tree of Thoughts (ToT), which generalizes over the popular Chain of Thought approach to prompting language models, and enables exploration over coherent units of text (thoughts) that serve as intermediate steps toward problem solving. ToT allows LMs to perform deliberate decision making by considering multiple different reasoning paths and self-evaluating choices to decide the next course of action, as well as looking ahead or backtracking when necessary to make global choices.

However, it is still unclear what the underlying capabilities of these LMs are. Surprisingly, we find that these models have limitations on certain basic symbolic manipulation tasks such as copy, reverse, and addition. When the total number of symbols or repeating symbols increases, the model performance drops quickly. We investigate the potential causes behind this phenomenon and examine a set of possible methods, including explicit positional markers, fine-grained computation steps, and LMs with callable programs. Experimental results show that none of these techniques can solve the simplest addition induction problem completely. In the end, we introduce LMs with tutor, which demonstrates every single step of teaching.

{"title": "Least-to-most prompting enables complex reasoning in large language models", "abstract": "Chain-of-thought prompting has demonstrated remarkable performance on various natural language reasoning tasks. However, it tends to perform poorly on tasks which requires solving problems harder than the exemplars shown in the prompts. To overcome this challenge of easy-to-hard generalization, we propose a novel prompting strategy, least-to-most prompting. The key idea in this strategy is to break down a complex problem into a series of simpler subproblems and then solve them in sequence. Solving each subproblem is facilitated by the answers to previously solved subproblems. Our experimental results on tasks related to symbolic manipulation, compositional generalization, and math reasoning reveal that least-to-most prompting is capable of generalizing to more difficult problems than those seen in the prompts. A notable finding is that when the GPT-3 code-davinci-002 model is used with least-to-most prompting, it can solve the compositional generalization benchmark SCAN in any split (including length split) with an accuracy of at least 99% using just 14 exemplars, compared to only 16% accuracy with chain-of-thought prompting. This is particularly noteworthy because neural-symbolic models in the literature that specialize in solving SCAN are trained on the entire training set containing over 15,000 examples.

To tackle multi-step reasoning tasks, Few-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting includes a few manually crafted step-by-step reasoning demonstrations which enable LLMs to explicitly generate reasoning steps and improve their reasoning task accuracy. To eliminate the manual efforts, Zero-shot-CoT concatenates the target problem statement with “Let’s think step by step” as an input prompt to LLMs. Despite the success of Zero-shot-CoT, it still suffers from three pitfalls: calculation errors, missing-step errors, and semantic misunderstanding errors. To address the missing-step errors, we propose Plan-and-Solve (PS) Prompting. It consists of two components: first, devising a plan to divide the entire task into smaller subtasks, and then carrying out the subtasks according to the plan. To address the calculation errors and improve the quality of generated reasoning steps, we extend PS prompting with more detailed instructions and derive PS+ prompting. We evaluate our proposed prompting strategy on ten datasets across three reasoning problems. The experimental results over GPT-3 show that our proposed zero-shot prompting consistently outperforms Zero-shot-CoT across all datasets by a large margin, is comparable to or exceeds Zero-shot-Program-of-Thought Prompting, and has comparable performance with 8-shot CoT prompting on the math reasoning problem.

Secondly, we answer the ‘where’ and ‘how’ questions by diving into the evaluation methods and benchmarks, which serve as crucial components in assessing the performance of LLMs. Then, we summarize the success and failure cases of LLMs in different tasks. Finally, we shed light on several future challenges that lie ahead in LLMs evaluation.

This work provides a road map for using LLMs as CSS tools. Towards this end, we contribute a set of prompting best practices and an extensive evaluation pipeline to measure the zero-shot performance of 13 language models on 25 representative English CSS benchmarks. On taxonomic labeling tasks (classification), LLMs fail to outperform the best fine-tuned models but still achieve fair levels of agreement with humans. On free-form coding tasks (generation), LLMs produce explanations that often exceed the quality of crowdworkers’ gold references. We conclude that the performance of today’s LLMs can augment the CSS research pipeline in two ways: (1) serving as zero-shot data annotators on human annotation teams, and (2) bootstrapping challenging creative generation tasks (e.g., explaining the underlying attributes of a text).

We present Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) to improve the transparency of language models. First, we taxonomize the vast space of potential scenarios (i.e. use cases) and metrics (i.e. desiderata) that are of interest for LMs. Then we select a broad subset based on coverage and feasibility, noting what's missing or underrepresented (e.g. question answering for neglected English dialects, metrics for trustworthiness). Second, we adopt a multi-metric approach: We measure 7 metrics (accuracy, calibration, robustness, fairness, bias, toxicity, and efficiency) for each of 16 core scenarios when possible (87.5% of the time). This ensures metrics beyond accuracy don't fall to the wayside, and that trade-offs are clearly exposed.

{"title": "Parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large-scale pre-trained language models", "abstract": "With the prevalence of pre-trained language models (PLMs) and the pre-training–fine-tuning paradigm, it has been continuously shown that larger models tend to yield better performance. However, as PLMs scale up, fine-tuning and storing all the parameters is prohibitively costly and eventually becomes practically infeasible. This necessitates a new branch of research focusing on the parameter-efficient adaptation of PLMs, which optimizes a small portion of the model parameters while keeping the rest fixed, drastically cutting down computation and storage costs. In general, it demonstrates that large-scale models could be effectively stimulated by the optimization of a few parameters. Despite the various designs, here we discuss and analyse the approaches under a more consistent and accessible term ‘delta-tuning’, where ‘delta’ a mathematical notation often used to denote changes, is borrowed to refer to the portion of parameters that are ‘changed’ during training. We formally describe the problem and propose a unified categorization criterion for existing delta-tuning methods to explore their correlations and differences. We also discuss the theoretical principles underlying the effectiveness of delta-tuning and interpret them from the perspectives of optimization and optimal control. Furthermore, we provide a holistic empirical study on over 100 natural language processing tasks and investigate various aspects of delta-tuning. With comprehensive study and analysis, our research demonstrates the theoretical and practical properties of delta-tuning in the adaptation of PLMs. Training a deep neural network can be costly but training time is reduced when a pre-trained network can be adapted to different use cases. Ideally, only a small number of parameters needs to be changed in this process of fine-tuning, which can then be more easily distributed. In this Analysis, different methods of fine-tuning with only a small number of parameters are compared on a large set of natural language processing tasks.", "arxivid": ""}

By observing that existing PSL schemes incur excessive training latency and a large volume of data transmissions, we propose an innovative PSL framework, namely, efficient parallel split learning (EPSL), to accelerate model training. To be specific, EPSL parallelizes client-side model training and reduces the dimension of activations’ gradients for backpropagation (BP) via last-layer gradient aggregation, leading to a significant reduction in server-side training and communication latency. Moreover, by considering the heterogeneous channel conditions and computing capabilities at edge devices, we jointly optimize subchannel allocation, power control, and cut layer selection to minimize the per-round latency. Simulation results show that the proposed EPSL framework significantly decreases the training latency needed to achieve a target accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art benchmarks, and the tailored resource management and layer split strategy can considerably reduce latency than the counterpart without optimization.", "arxivid": "2303.15991v4"}

We explore $\\textbf{grammar prompting}$ as a simple approach for enabling LLMs to use external knowledge and domain-specific constraints, expressed through a grammar expressed in Backus--Naur Form (BNF), during in-context learning. Grammar prompting augments each demonstration example with a specialized grammar that is minimally sufficient for generating the particular output example, where the specialized grammar is a subset of the full DSL grammar. For inference, the LLM first predicts a BNF grammar given a test input, and then generates the output according to the rules of the grammar. Experiments demonstrate that grammar prompting can enable LLMs to perform competitively on a diverse set of DSL generation tasks, including semantic parsing (SMCalFlow, Overnight, GeoQuery), PDDL planning, and even molecule generation (SMILES).", "arxivid": "2305.19234v3"}

This method addresses the challenges of explainability, scalability, and privacy by allowing network operators to inspect the generated code, removing the need to share network data with LLMs, and focusing on application-specific requests combined with program synthesis techniques.

{"title": "Repairing bugs in Python assignments using large language models", "abstract": "Students often make mistakes on their introductory programming assignments as part of their learning process. Unfortunately, providing custom repairs for these mistakes can require a substantial amount of time and effort from class instructors. Automated program repair (APR) techniques can be used to synthesize such fixes. Prior work has explored the use of symbolic and neural techniques for APR in the education domain. Both types of approaches require either substantial engineering efforts or large amounts of data and training. We propose to use a large language model trained on code, such as Codex, to build an APR system -- MMAPR -- for introductory Python programming assignments. Our system can fix both syntactic and semantic mistakes by combining multi-modal prompts, iterative querying, test-case-based selection of few-shots, and program chunking. We evaluate MMAPR on 286 real student programs and compare to a baseline built by combining a state-of-the-art Python syntax repair engine, BIFI, and state-of-the-art Python semantic repair engine for student assignments, Refactory. We find that MMAPR can fix more programs and produce smaller patches on average.", "arxivid": "2209.14876v1"}

We construct an evaluation framework comprising test-benches for functional analysis and a flow to test the syntax of Verilog code generated in response to problems of varying difficulty. Our findings show that across our problem scenarios, the fine-tuning results in LLMs more capable of producing syntactically correct code (25.9% overall).

{"title": "LLMbased policy generation for intent-based management of applications", "abstract": "Automated management requires decomposing high-level user requests, such as intents, to an abstraction that the system can understand and execute. This is challenging because even a simple intent requires performing a number of ordered steps. And the task of identifying and adapting these steps (as conditions change) requires a decomposition approach that cannot be exactly pre-defined beforehand. To tackle these challenges and support automated intent decomposition and execution, we explore the few-shot capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose a pipeline that progressively decomposes intents by generating the required actions using a policy-based abstraction. This allows us to automate the policy execution by creating a closed control loop for the intent deployment. To do so, we generate and map the policies to APIs and form application management loops that perform the necessary monitoring, analysis, planning and execution. We evaluate our proposal with a use-case to fulfill and assure an application service chain of virtual network functions. Using our approach, we can generalize and generate the necessary steps to realize intents, thereby enabling intent automation for application management.", "arxivid": ""}

Several secondary studies have been published on code smells, discussing their implications on software quality, their impact on maintenance and evolution, and existing tools for their detection. Other secondary studies addressed refactoring, discussing refactoring techniques, opportunities for refactoring, impact on quality, and tools support. In this paper, we present a tertiary systematic literature review of previous surveys, secondary systematic literature reviews, and systematic mappings. We identify the main observations (what we know) and challenges (what we do not know) on code smells and refactoring. We perform this tertiary review using eight scientific databases, based on a set of five research questions, identifying 40 secondary studies between 1992 and 2018. We organize the main observations and challenges about code smell and their refactoring into: smells definitions, most common code-smell detection approaches, code-smell detection tools, most common refactoring, and refactoring tools. We show that code smells and refactoring have a strong relationship with quality attributes, i.e., with understandability, maintainability, testability, complexity, functionality, and reusability. We argue that code smells and refactoring could be considered as the two faces of a same coin. Besides, we identify how refactoring affects quality attributes, more than code smells. We also discuss the implications of this work for practitioners, researchers, and instructors. We identify 13 open issues that could guide future research work. Thus, we want to highlight the gap between code smells and refactoring in the current state of software-engineering research.

Different from the previous classification-oriented methods, DetPro has two highlights: 1) a background interpretation scheme to include the proposals in image background into the prompt training; 2) a context grading scheme to separate proposals in image foreground for tailored prompt training. We assemble DetPro with ViLD, a recent state-of-the-art openworld object detector, and conduct experiments on the LVIS as well as transfer learning on the Pascal VOC, COCO, Objects365 datasets. Experimental results show that our DetPro outperforms the baseline ViLD [7] in all settings, e.g., +3.4 APbox and +3.0 APmask improvements on the novel classes of LVIS.

{"title": "Threatzoom: neural network for automated vulnerability mitigation", "abstract": "Increasing the variety and quantity of cyber threats becoming the evident that traditional human-in-loop approaches are no longer sufficient to keep systems safe. To address this momentous moot point, forward-thinking pioneers propose new cyber security strategy using automation to build a more efficient and cheaper defense. Associating large number of unpatchable CVEs (vulnerability descriptions) generated everyday to appropriate CWE (weakness) and CAPEC (attack pattern) can be used to automatically infer the expected impact and corresponding mitigation course of actions for that new CVE. Routinely, adversary exploits a vulnerability to trigger a cyber attack where this vulnerability results from a product or system weakness. Hence, finding a common system weakness associated with a vulnerability within a particular product can help to identifying the software, system, or architecture flaw and the potential attack impacts. This identification leads to prevent, detect, and mitigate those flaws. On the other hand, after recognizing the cause and the effect of a vulnerability, discovering the procedural-oriented description of the attack to create behavioral observables for detection and mitigation is necessary that can be derived from CAPEC and ATTCK. Mapping the CWE to CAPEC and ATTCK which provides pre-TTP and post-TTP respectively where TTP stands for Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures. Having all CWE, CAPEC, and ATTCK in one hand enables us to find corresponding mitigation for each one. On the other hand, extracting threat actions provided by each of these concepts leads to find another type of mitigation coming from Critical Security Controls (CSC). In this proposal, the target is to do mapping all the way from CVE to CAPEC and ATTCk automatically using machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing and find the appropriate mitigation for each one and then find a proper patch as course of action defense.

One or more CVEs are grouped into the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) classes for the purpose of understanding the software or configuration flaws and potential impacts enabled by these vulnerabilities and identifying means to detect or prevent exploitation. As the CVE-to-CWE classification is mostly performed manually by domain experts, thousands of critical and new CVEs remain unclassified, yet they are unpatchable. This significantly limits the utility of CVEs and slows down proactive threat mitigation. This paper presents the first automatic tool to classify CVEs to CWEs. ThreatZoom uses a novel learning algorithm that employs an adaptive hierarchical neural network which adjusts its weights based on text analytic scores and classification errors. It automatically estimates the CWE classes corresponding to a CVE instance using both statistical and semantic features extracted from the description of a CVE.

However, analyzing user intents is not easy, especially for emerging forms of Web search such as Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven chat. To understand user intents from retrospective log data, we need a way to label them with meaningful categories that capture their diversity and dynamics. Existing methods rely on manual or Machine-Learned (ML) labeling, which is either expensive or inflexible for large and dynamic datasets. Large Language Models (LLMs) could generate rich and relevant concepts, descriptions, and examples for user intents using log data of user interactions. However, using LLMs to generate a user intent taxonomy and applying it for a given Information Retrieval (IR) application can be problematic for two main reasons: (1) such a taxonomy is not externally validated; and (2) there may be an undesirable feedback loop if an LLM does both these tasks without external validation. To address this, we propose a new methodology with human experts and assessors to verify the quality of the LLM-generated taxonomy. We also present an end-to-end pipeline that uses an LLM with Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) to produce, refine, and apply labels for user intent analysis in log data. We demonstrate its effectiveness by uncovering new insights into user intents from search and chat logs from the Microsoft Bing Web search engine. The novelty in this research stems from the method for generating purpose-driven user intent taxonomies with strong validation. Our approach not only helps remove methodological and practical bottlenecks from intent-focused research, but also provides a new framework for generating, validating, and applying other kinds of taxonomies in a scalable and adaptable way, with reasonable human effort.", "arxivid": "2309.13063v3"}

In 5G NR system, the beam sweeping and beam refinement are employed to find out the best beam codeword aligned to the mobile. Due to the complicated handshaking and finite resolution of the codebook, today's 5G-based beam management strategy is ineffective in various scenarios in terms of the data rate, energy consumption, and also processing latency. An aim of this article is to introduce a new type of beam management framework based on the computer vision (CV) technique. In this framework referred to as computer vision-aided beam management (CVBM), a camera attached to the BS captures the image and the deep learning-based object detector identifies the 3D location of the mobile. Since the base station can directly set the beam direction without the codebook quantization and feedback delay, CVBM achieves the significant beamforming gain and latency reduction. Using the specially designed dataset called Vision Objects for Beam Management (VOBEM), we demonstrate that CVBM achieves more than 40 percent improvement in the beamforming gain and 40 percent reduction in the beam training overhead over the 5G NR beam management.", "arxivid": "2209.02258v1"}

Results of many tasks, even those requiring high computational power, can be obtained within a short delay by offloading them to edge clouds. However, although edge clouds are exploited, real-time object detection cannot always be guaranteed due to dynamic channel quality. To mitigate this problem, we propose an edge-network-assisted real-time object detection framework (EODF). In an EODF, AVs extract the region of interest (Rols) of the captured image when the channel quality is not sufficiently good for supporting real-time object detection. Then AVs compress the image data on the basis of the Rols and transmit the compressed one to the edge cloud. In so doing, real-time object detection can be achieved due to the reduced transmission latency. To verify the feasibility of our framework, we evaluate the probability that the results of object detection are not received within the inter-frame duration (i.e., outage probability) and their accuracy. From the evaluation, we demonstrate that the proposed EODF provides the results to AVs in real time and achieves satisfactory accuracy.", "arxivid": "2008.07083v1"}

This two-part paper explores the use of FP in the design and optimization of communication systems. Part I of this paper focuses on FP theory and on solving continuous problems. The main theoretical contribution is a novel quadratic transform technique for tackling the multiple-ratio concave–convex FP problem—in contrast to conventional FP techniques that mostly can only deal with the single-ratio or the max-min-ratio case. Multiple-ratio FP problems are important for the optimization of communication networks, because system-level design often involves multiple signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio terms. This paper considers the applications of FP to solving continuous problems in communication system design, particularly for power control, beamforming, and energy efficiency maximization. These application cases illustrate that the proposed quadratic transform can greatly facilitate the optimization involving ratios by recasting the original nonconvex problem as a sequence of convex problems. This FP-based problem reformulation gives rise to an efficient iterative optimization algorithm with provable convergence to a stationary point. The paper further demonstrates close connections between the proposed FP approach and other well-known algorithms in the literature, such as the fixed-point iteration and the weighted minimum mean-square-error beamforming.

The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4, was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version of GPT-4, when it was still in active development by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT-4 is part of a new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google's PaLM for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4's performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4's capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system. In our exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its limitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper and more comprehensive versions of AGI, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction.

We propose Reflexion, a novel framework to reinforce language agents not by updating weights, but instead through linguistic feedback. Concretely, Reflexion agents verbally reflect on task feedback signals, then maintain their own reflective text in an episodic memory buffer to induce better decision-making in subsequent trials. Reflexion is flexible enough to incorporate various types (scalar values or free-form language) and sources (external or internally simulated) of feedback signals, and obtains significant improvements over a baseline agent across diverse tasks (sequential decision-making, coding, language reasoning).

But on what tasks do language models fall short of average human-rater performance, and are those tasks actually unsolvable by current language models? In this work, we focus on a suite of 23 challenging BIG-Bench tasks which we call BIG-Bench Hard (BBH). These are the task for which prior language model evaluations did not outperform the average human-rater. We find that applying chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to BBH tasks enables PaLM to surpass the average human-rater performance on 10 of the 23 tasks, and Codex (code-davinci-002) to surpass the average human-rater performance on 17 of the 23 tasks. Since many tasks in BBH require multi-step reasoning, few-shot prompting without CoT, as done in the BIG-Bench evaluations (Srivastava et al., 2022), substantially underestimates the best performance and capabilities of language models, which is better captured via CoT prompting.

Inevitably, agents encounter new scenarios (e.g., new types of terrain) where optimizing that same reward may lead to undesired behavior. Our insight is that reward functions are merely observations about what the designer actually wants, and that they should be interpreted in the context in which they were designed.

Many operational parameters affect reference signal received power (RSRP), reference signal received quality (RSRQ), signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR), and, ultimately, throughput. In this paper, we develop and compare two approaches for maximizing coverage and minimizing interference by jointly optimizing the transmit power and downtilt (elevation tilt) settings across sectors. To evaluate different parameter configurations offline, we construct a realistic simulation model that captures geographic correlations. Using this model, we evaluate two optimization methods: deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, and multi-objective Bayesian optimization (BO). Our simulations show that both approaches significantly outperform random search and converge to comparable Pareto frontiers, but that BO converges with two orders of magnitude fewer evaluations than DDPG. Our results suggest that data-driven techniques can effectively self-optimize coverage and capacity in cellular networks.", "arxivid": "2010.13710v2"}

HEMS have been designed to emulate the statistical and functional characteristics of real smart grids. However, a major challenge in this research area is the limited availability of publicly accessible datasets. To address this challenge and further leverage the potential of artificial HEMS applications, it is crucial to develop time series that accurately represent diverse operating conditions of synthetic systems.

Additionally, we investigate the performance of the generative model when integrated with a Q-learning based HEMS. The effectiveness of the Q-learning based HEMS is assessed through online experiments using real-world smart home data. To evaluate the quality of the generated dataset, we employ various metrics including Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), and the Wasserstein distance, which quantify the disparities between probability distributions of the real and synthetic data.

{"title": "The power of scale for parameter-efficient prompt tuning", "abstract": "In this work, we explore “prompt tuning,” a simple yet effective mechanism for learning “soft prompts” to condition frozen language models to perform specific downstream tasks. Unlike the discrete text prompts used by GPT-3, soft prompts are learned through backpropagation and can be tuned to incorporate signals from any number of labeled examples. Our end-to-end learned approach outperforms GPT-3’s few-shot learning by a large margin. More remarkably, through ablations on model size using T5, we show that prompt tuning becomes more competitive with scale: as models exceed billions of parameters, our method “closes the gap” and matches the strong performance of model tuning (where all model weights are tuned). This finding is especially relevant because large models are costly to share and serve and the ability to reuse one frozen model for multiple downstream tasks can ease this burden. Our method can be seen as a simplification of the recently proposed “prefix tuning” of Li and Liang (2021) and we provide a comparison to this and other similar approaches. Finally, we show that conditioning a frozen model with soft prompts confers benefits in robustness to domain transfer and enables efficient “prompt ensembling.” We release code and model checkpoints to reproduce our experiments.", "arxivid": "2104.08691v2"}

Deep train-from-scratch models have exhibited effective performance yet require large amounts of data, which limits real-world applicability. Recently, researchers have leveraged the representation learning transferability of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle limited non-linguistic datasets effectively. However, incorporating LLMs with time-series data presents challenges of limited adaptation due to different compositions between time-series and linguistic data, and the inability to process multi-scale temporal information. To tackle these challenges, we propose LLM4TS, a framework for time-series forecasting with pre-trained LLMs. LLM4TS consists of a two-stage fine-tuning strategy: the time-series alignment stage to align LLMs with the nuances of time-series data and the forecasting fine-tuning stage for downstream time-series forecasting tasks. Furthermore, our framework features a novel two-level aggregation method that integrates multi-scale temporal data within pre-trained LLMs, enhancing their ability to interpret time-specific information.

On the other hand, summarization can help developers and practitioners understand the high level of the protocol, which is itself a daunting task. Our results show the value of our 5G-centric dataset in 5G protocol analysis automation. We believe that SPEC5G will enable a new research direction into automatic analyses for the 5G cellular network protocol and numerous related downstream tasks. Our data and code are publicly available.", "arxivid": "2301.09201v2"}
{"title": "Tspec-llm: An opensource dataset for llm understanding of 3gpp specifications", "abstract": "Understanding telecom standards involves sorting through numerous technical documents, such as those produced by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. While large language models (LLMs) can assist with the extensive 3GPP knowledge base, an inclusive dataset is crucial for their effective pre-training and fine-tuning. In this paper, we introduce TSpec-LLM, an open-source comprehensive dataset covering all 3GPP documents from Release 8 to Release 19 (1999–2023). To evaluate its efficacy, we first select a representative sample of 3GPP documents, create corresponding technical questions, and assess the baseline performance of various LLMs. We then incorporate a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework to enhance LLM capabilities by retrieving relevant context from the TSpec-LLM dataset. Our evaluation shows that using a naive-RAG framework on TSpec-LLM improves the accuracy of GPT-3.5, Gemini 1.0 Pro, and GPT-4 from 44%, 46%, and 51% to 71%, 75%, and 72%, respectively.", "arxivid": ""}
{"title": "An empirical study of netops capability of pre-trained large language models", "abstract": "Nowadays, the versatile capabilities of Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted much attention from the industry. However, some vertical domains are more interested in the in-domain capabilities of LLMs. For the Networks domain, we present NetEval, an evaluation set for measuring the comprehensive capabilities of LLMs in Network Operations (NetOps). NetEval is designed for evaluating the commonsense knowledge and inference ability in NetOps in a multi-lingual context. NetEval consists of 5,732 questions about NetOps, covering five different sub-domains of NetOps. With NetEval, we systematically evaluate the NetOps capability of 26 publicly available LLMs. The results show that only GPT-4 can achieve a performance competitive to humans. However, some open models like LLaMA 2 demonstrate significant potential.", "arxivid": "2309.05557v3"}

{"title": "Oran-bench-13k: An open source benchmark for assessing llms in open radio access networks", "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can revolutionize how we deploy and operate Open Radio Access Networks (0-RAN) by enhancing network analytics, anomaly detection, and code generation and significantly increasing the efficiency and reliability of a plethora of 0- RAN tasks. In this paper, we present ORAN-Bench-13K, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the context of O-RAN. Our benchmark consists of 13,952 meticulously curated multiple-choice questions generated from 116 O-RAN specification documents. We leverage a novel three- stage LLM framework, and the questions are categorized into three distinct difficulties to cover a wide spectrum of 0 RAN- related knowledge. We thoroughly evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art LLMs, including Gemini, Chat-GPT, and Mistral. Additionally, we propose ORANSight, a Retrieval- Augmented Generation (RAG)-based pipeline that demonstrates superior performance on ORAN-Bench-13K compared to other tested closed-source models. Our findings indicate that current popular LLM models are not proficient in O-RAN, highlighting the need for specialized models. We observed a noticeable performance improvement when incorporating the RAG-based ORANSight pipeline, with a Macro Accuracy of 0.784 and a Weighted Accuracy of 0.776, which was on average 21.55% and 22.59% better than the other tested LLMs.", "arxivid": "2407.06245v2"}
{"title": "Enchancing semisupervised learning for extractive summarization with an llm-based pseudolabeler", "abstract": "Generating high-quality summaries for chat dialogs often requires large labeled datasets. We propose a method to efficiently use unlabeled data for extractive summarization of customer-agent dialogs. In our method, we frame summarization as a question-answering problem and use state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) to generate pseudo-labels for a dialog. We then use these pseudo-labels to fine-tune a chat summarization model, effectively transferring knowledge from the large LLM into a smaller specialized model. We demonstrate our method on the \\tweetsumm dataset, and show that using 10% of the original labelled data set we can achieve 65.9/57.0/61.0 ROUGE-1/-2/-L, whereas the current state-of-the-art trained on the entire training data set obtains 65.16/55.81/64.37 ROUGE-1/-2/-L. In other words, in the worst case (i.e., ROUGE-L) we still effectively retain 94.7% of the performance while using only 10% of the data.", "arxivid": ""}

{"title": "Frugalgpt: How to use large language models while reducing cost and improving performance", "abstract": "There is a rapidly growing number of large language models (LLMs) that users can query for a fee. We review the cost associated with querying popular LLM APIs, e.g. GPT-4, ChatGPT, J1-Jumbo, and find that these models have heterogeneous pricing structures, with fees that can differ by two orders of magnitude. In particular, using LLMs on large collections of queries and text can be expensive. Motivated by this, we outline and discuss three types of strategies that users can exploit to reduce the inference cost associated with using LLMs: 1) prompt adaptation, 2) LLM approximation, and 3) LLM cascade. As an example, we propose FrugalGPT, a simple yet flexible instantiation of LLM cascade which learns which combinations of LLMs to use for different queries in order to reduce cost and improve accuracy. Our experiments show that FrugalGPT can match the performance of the best individual LLM (e.g. GPT-4) with up to 98% cost reduction or improve the accuracy over GPT-4 by 4% with the same cost. The ideas and findings presented here lay a foundation for using LLMs sustainably and efficiently.", "arxivid": "2305.05176v1"}
