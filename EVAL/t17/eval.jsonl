{"name": "a", "paperour": [4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4], "reason": ["Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\n- Research Objective Clarity\n  - The paper’s title and structure imply a clear objective: to provide “a comprehensive survey on principles, key techniques, and opportunities” of LLMs in telecommunications. Across Introduction sections 1.1–1.5, the manuscript consistently frames LLMs in the telecom context and signals the survey’s scope: evolution (1.1), industry impact and challenges (1.2), architectural underpinnings relevant to telecom (1.3), comparisons with traditional models (1.4), and current trends and collaborations (1.5). \n  - However, the Introduction does not explicitly state a concise research objective or a set of guiding research questions. There is no clear “Objectives and Contributions” paragraph detailing what the survey uniquely offers (e.g., taxonomy, framework, methodological lens). The absence of an Abstract in the provided content further reduces the clarity of the research objective and contributions.\n\n- Background and Motivation\n  - Strongly articulated. Section 1.1 (Evolution and Emergence of LLMs) thoroughly situates the reader, tracing from statistical language models to transformers and GPT-series (“A significant turning point was the introduction of the Transformer architecture…”; “GPT-3… exemplified LLMs’ power…”), and acknowledges constraints like sustainability, accessibility, and biases (“challenges remain… computational resources… equitable access… reliability…”).\n  - Section 1.2 (Significance and Impact in Telecommunications) provides compelling industry-specific motivation: automation of routine processes, multilingual service delivery, and intelligent network management (“LLMs promise significant service delivery enhancements… multilingual communications…”, “LLMs… contribute to optimizing traffic…”; “AI-native telecom systems…”; “intent-based networking…”). It also covers critical constraints (computational demands, privacy and regulatory concerns), showing a balanced motivation aligned with real-world deployment issues.\n  - Section 1.5 (Current Research Trends and Collaborations) anchors the survey in contemporary literature and cross-disciplinary efforts, citing concrete threads like AI-native systems, semantic routing, RAG with transactional stream processing, security, and efficient serving. This demonstrates awareness of the research landscape and supports the survey’s relevance.\n\n- Practical Significance and Guidance Value\n  - The manuscript demonstrates practical relevance throughout the Introduction:\n    - Section 1.2 links LLM capabilities directly to operational telecom needs (customer support, multilingual translation, network optimization, AI-native and intent-based networking for 5G/6G).\n    - Section 1.3 emphasizes telecom-relevant architectural features (self-attention, scalability, model parallelism, LoRA/quantization, RAG, and edge deployment) with explicit telecom benefits (“Deploying LLMs in 6G edge environments helps mitigate bandwidth costs…”).\n    - Section 1.4 contrasts LLMs with traditional approaches and highlights where LLMs meaningfully outperform (zero-/few-shot versatility, multilingual scope, semantic routing/intent-based networking).\n    - Section 1.5 ties these themes to active research collaborations and systems-level frameworks (e.g., TStreamLLM), reinforcing guidance value for practitioners and researchers.\n  - What’s missing is an explicit statement of the survey’s unique contributions and how the subsequent sections will systematize the field (e.g., a formal taxonomy, mapping techniques-to-applications, inclusion/exclusion criteria, survey methodology). Without this, the guidance value is strong but not maximally clear.\n\nWhy not 5:\n- No Abstract provided in the excerpt to clearly state scope, objectives, and contributions.\n- The Introduction does not include an explicit, concise research objective or contribution statement (e.g., “This survey contributes X, Y, Z; we propose a taxonomy; we identify gaps; we define evaluation criteria; we provide practitioner guidelines”).\n- No methodology section in the Introduction describing literature selection, time span, sources, or evaluation protocol, which would improve objective clarity and guidance value.\n\nSuggestions to reach 5:\n- Add an Abstract summarizing: scope, key contributions, taxonomy/framework, main findings, and guidance for practitioners/researchers.\n- Insert an “Objectives and Contributions” paragraph in the Introduction that:\n  - States the survey’s precise aims (e.g., synthesize principles, classify key techniques, map telecom applications, identify challenges and future directions).\n  - Outlines unique contributions (taxonomy, deployment patterns, evaluation metrics, best-practice checklists).\n  - Defines survey methodology (search strategy, databases, time window, inclusion/exclusion criteria).\n- Provide a structural roadmap figure linking sections to objectives to improve navigability and guidance value.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nOverall, the survey offers a relatively clear and reasonable method classification, and it partially presents the evolution of methodologies. It reflects major technical trajectories in LLMs and their deployment in telecommunications, but the connections between some methods and the systematic evolution across all categories are not uniformly articulated, which prevents a top score.\n\nWhat supports the score:\n\n- Method Classification Clarity\n  - Chapter 2 (Principles and Foundations of LLMs) provides a coherent taxonomy of foundational aspects that serve as “methods” in the sense of enabling techniques:\n    - 2.1 (Core Principles of LLMs) frames structured reasoning, ethical alignment, and robustness as guiding principles, which sets a clear scaffold for subsequent technical methods.\n    - 2.2 (Architecture of LLMs) groups architectural innovations—Transformer, LoRA, quantization, neuro-symbolic integration—into a meaningful set that directly maps to performance and deployment trade-offs in telecom contexts. The passage “Among the innovations to increase LLM efficiency is the development of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)… Quantization presents another architectural innovation…” shows good categorization of efficiency techniques.\n    - 2.3 (Training Methodologies) clearly classifies training paradigms: pre-training (“Pre-training serves as the cornerstone…”), instruction-tuning (“Instruction-tuning… further refines pre-trained models…”), hierarchical models, federated learning, and data-efficient techniques. This is a standard, understandable taxonomy aligning with the field’s practice.\n    - 2.4 (Integration and Deployment in Telecommunications) groups integration strategies: AI-native architectures, edge computing, and cloud–edge collaboration, which is appropriate and clear for telecom systems practice.\n    - 2.5 (Enhancing Data Processing and Automation) further segments methods such as reinforcement learning (“reinforcement learning can be integrated with human feedback…”) and transactional stream processing (TStreamLLM), both well-situated for telecom.\n  - Chapter 3 (Key Techniques and Strategies for LLM Deployment) separates practical technique families:\n    - 3.1 (Prompt Engineering), 3.2 (Fine-Tuning and Specialized Training), 3.3 (Multilingual Capabilities), 3.4 (Integration with Domain-Specific Knowledge Bases via RAG), 3.5 (Tool-Augmented LLMs), and 3.6 (Evaluation and Optimization Strategies). These are standard and recognizable categories that match the broader literature and telecom needs.\n  - Chapter 4 (Applications) and Chapter 7 (Evaluation and Performance Metrics) then move to applications and evaluation frameworks, which are appropriate for a survey and consistent with the prior method taxonomy.\n\n- Evolution of Methodology\n  - The evolution narrative is explicitly addressed in 1.1 (Evolution and Emergence of LLMs): it traces the path from statistical language models to Transformers (“A significant turning point was the introduction of the Transformer architecture…”), then to BERT (“deep bidirectional understanding”), through the GPT series (“pre-training on vast datasets followed by fine-tuning”), and finally to models like GPT-3/4 and ChatGPT. This section systematically presents milestones and is well-aligned with field history.\n  - 2.2 (Architecture of LLMs) speaks to the evolutionary push toward efficiency and deployment with LoRA and quantization and mentions neuro-symbolic integration to improve reasoning—this reasonably conveys methodological progression beyond raw scaling (“These architectural advancements align with a broader vision for LLM deployment…”).\n  - 2.3 (Training Methodologies) shows progression from foundational pre-training to instruction-tuning, hierarchical modeling, federated learning, and data-efficient techniques, which reflects the field’s shift from monolithic training to parameter-efficient and privacy-preserving schemes.\n  - 1.5 (Current Research Trends and Collaborations) and 2.4 (Integration and Deployment) discuss the trend toward AI-native network systems and edge deployment; 2.5 (Enhancing Data Processing and Automation) adds RLHF adaptation and transactional stream processing—these sections collectively indicate where the field is moving for telecom-scale responsiveness and sustainability.\n\nWhere the survey falls short for a perfect score:\n- While the classification is clear, the evolutionary linkages across all method categories are not consistently systematized. For example:\n  - In Chapter 3, the techniques are presented as a menu rather than as a chronological or causal progression. Prompt engineering (3.1), fine-tuning (3.2), multilingual capabilities (3.3), RAG (3.4), and tool augmentation (3.5) are all important, but their interdependencies and how one emerged to address specific limitations of another are only intermittently discussed. For instance, the relationship between instruction-tuning, RLHF, prompt engineering, and tool-augmented approaches is touched on in places (e.g., “Tools such as prompt engineering and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)…” in 1.3; “tool augmentation involves the coupling of LLMs with a range of external mechanisms…” in 3.5), but not laid out as an explicit evolutionary chain.\n  - The transition from monolingual to multilingual LLMs (3.3) lacks a clearer historical arc tying back to earlier training practices and datasets; it focuses more on current strategies than on the evolution path.\n  - The overlap among 3.4 (RAG) and 3.5 (Tool-Augmented LLMs) is acknowledged but not explicitly structured to show that tool-augmentation is a broader paradigm of which RAG is a specific instance; this can blur the evolutionary narrative.\n  - 3.6 (Evaluation and Optimization Strategies) introduces self-improvement and cognitive-agent strategies, but these are not explicitly connected back to earlier training or deployment trends in a temporal or developmental sense.\n- The survey could benefit from an explicit timeline or taxonomy diagram that maps method families to historical stages and telecom-specific drivers (e.g., moving from pre-training/fine-tuning to parameter-efficient tuning, RAG/tool augmentation, and streaming/edge deployment motivated by telecom latency/scalability/privacy constraints).\n\nIn sum, the paper’s classification is strong and appropriate for the field, and the evolution of methodologies is presented in several key sections—most notably 1.1, 2.2, and 2.3—reflecting the state of the art. The missing piece is a consistently articulated, end-to-end evolutionary thread unifying all method categories and clarifying their interconnections and sequencing, which is why the score is 4 rather than 5.", "3\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey provides some coverage of datasets and evaluation metrics, but it is limited in breadth and detail and does not comprehensively describe dataset scales, labeling methods, or task-specific metrics across the telecom landscape.\n\nEvidence of coverage:\n- Datasets are only briefly mentioned and not described in detail. In 6.4 “Churn Prediction Using Social Network Analytics,” the paper names “Telecom Customer Data Set and the Social Network Analysis Data Set (SNADS)” as foundational sources, but does not specify their scale, labeling methods, or data provenance. Similarly, 4.4 “Telecom Standards and Document Processing” references “TeleQnA — A Benchmark Dataset to Assess Large Language Models Telecommunications Knowledge [79],” but does not describe its size, annotation scheme, or task composition.\n- The Evaluation section is stronger conceptually but still lacks concrete, task-specific metrics commonly used in the field. In 7.1 “Evaluation Framework Design,” the paper proposes general telecom-oriented metrics—“latency, language understanding accuracy, adaptability to new protocols, and resource efficiency”—and human-centered metrics like “user satisfaction” and “reliability,” but these are not operationalized with definitions, measurement procedures, or benchmark baselines.\n- The survey does include standard ML metrics in one application: 6.4 notes “precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the curve (AUC)” for churn prediction evaluation, which is appropriate for classification. However, other major application areas covered in the paper lack equivalent rigor. For instance:\n  - 4.1 “Multilingual Machine Translation” discusses advances and challenges but omits standard MT metrics (e.g., BLEU, chrF, COMET) and widely used datasets (e.g., WMT, FLORES), and provides no quantitative evaluation references.\n  - 4.2 “Network Management and Optimization” and 4.5 “Semantic Routing and Intent-Based Networking” do not specify domain-specific KPIs or network evaluation metrics (e.g., throughput, packet loss, SLA violation rate, configuration accuracy, mean time to resolution), nor how LLM interventions would be measured against baselines.\n- Sections 7.2–7.4 provide thoughtful frameworks for trustworthiness, ethical evaluation, domain-specific benchmarking, and human-automated evaluation synergy. For example, 7.3 emphasizes the need for “telecom-specific benchmarks” and recognizes limitations of general-purpose LLMs on standards tasks, and 7.4 articulates strengths of human and automated evaluation. Yet, these remain high-level: they do not enumerate key telecom datasets (e.g., CDR logs, 3GPP corpora, open traffic traces like CAIDA/MAWI), nor do they map concrete metrics to the specific tasks covered elsewhere in the survey.\n- 7.6 “Data Integrity and Contamination” and 7.1’s call for “FAIR” principles indicate good methodological awareness, but again lack concrete dataset descriptions, curation protocols, or contamination controls for telecom-specific corpora.\n\nRationality assessment:\n- Where metrics are mentioned (e.g., precision/recall/F1/AUC for churn in 6.4; latency/resource efficiency/user satisfaction in 7.1; “response time accuracy and failure rates” in 3.6/7.1), they are academically sound and practically meaningful for their respective tasks. However, the review does not consistently extend this rigor to other key telecom applications it discusses (MT, standards Q&A, semantic routing, network optimization).\n- The dataset coverage is notably thin: aside from naming TeleQnA and generic references to customer and social network datasets, the survey does not catalogue important datasets in telecom nor provide details on scale, annotation, or use cases.\n\nOverall, the paper presents a reasonable evaluation framework at a conceptual level and includes appropriate metrics for a subset of tasks (churn prediction), but it lacks comprehensive and detailed coverage of datasets and evaluation metrics across the breadth of telecom applications discussed. This aligns with a score of 3 per the rubric.", "Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey provides pros/cons and differences for several methods, but the comparisons are largely presented in isolation and lack a systematic, multi-dimensional structure. It meets the criterion for mentioning advantages and disadvantages, yet falls short of offering a rigorous, side-by-side contrast across clear dimensions such as modeling perspective, data dependency, learning strategy, and application scenarios.\n\nEvidence supporting this score includes:\n\n- Strong, structured comparison in Section 1.4 (Comparisons with Traditional Models):  \n  The paper explicitly frames a comparison across “performance, versatility, and scope” and discusses concrete distinctions like zero/few-shot capabilities versus the need for retraining, and resource demands. For example:  \n  - “This transformation is underscored by comparing these models based on several critical parameters: performance, versatility, and scope…”  \n  - “Traditional settings often required building specific models for specific tasks… LLMs, with expansive contextual understanding, naturally handle multitasking…”  \n  - “Their adoption facilitates transformative improvements… albeit with increased resource demands.”  \n  This shows a clear, multi-dimensional comparison with articulated pros/cons and distinctions. This section is the clearest and most systematic comparative analysis in the survey.\n\n- Elsewhere, methods are mostly described independently without systematic cross-method contrasts:\n  - Section 2.2 (Architecture of LLMs) lists LoRA, quantization, and neuro-symbolic AI with their respective advantages, but does not compare them directly across assumptions, trade-offs, or application scenarios. For example:  \n    - “LoRA… reducing the number of trainable parameters…”  \n    - “Quantization… reduces memory usage and computational demands…”  \n    - “Integration of neuro-symbolic AI… boosts interpretability and decision-making accuracy…”  \n    These are descriptive benefits rather than structured comparisons (no discussion of when LoRA is preferable to quantization, or how neuro-symbolic approaches differ in objectives/assumptions).\n\n  - Section 2.3 (Training Methodologies) enumerates pre-training, instruction-tuning, hierarchical models, federated learning, and data-efficient techniques, but treats them largely in isolation.  \n    - “Instruction-tuning… enhances domain-specific task effectiveness…”  \n    - “Federated learning offers a decentralized model training approach… beneficial in telecommunications environments that prioritize user data privacy…”  \n    - “Data-efficient training techniques… such as data pruning and transfer learning…”  \n    Although pros and application relevance are identified for each, the survey does not systematically contrast these methods across shared dimensions (e.g., data dependency, privacy assumptions, scalability trade-offs, latency constraints in telecom).\n\n  - Section 3.1 (Prompt Engineering) and Section 3.2 (Fine-Tuning and Specialized Training) illustrate this pattern:  \n    - 3.1: “Prompt engineering… provides an efficient alternative to extensive fine-tuning by focusing on input manipulation… avoiding the need for exhaustive model weight modifications…” and mentions limitations (“requires a deep understanding of model behavior”).  \n    - 3.2: Emphasizes parameter-efficient fine-tuning (“LoRA… resource-effective”) and domain-specific corpora.  \n    The paper notes prompt engineering as an alternative to fine-tuning but does not develop a structured, side-by-side comparison across assumptions (e.g., data requirements, maintainability, brittleness, reproducibility), or scenarios (e.g., when to prefer prompts vs. PEFT techniques like LoRA in telecom workloads).\n\n  - Section 3.4 (Integration with Domain-Specific Knowledge Bases) and Section 3.5 (Tool-Augmented LLMs) present RAG, knowledge prompts, and tool integration clearly, but the comparative aspect between these techniques and others (e.g., fine-tuning, prompt engineering) is limited.  \n    - 3.4: “RAG integrates a retrieval step… ensuring responses… informed by domain-specific data…”  \n    - 3.5: “Tool augmentation… coupling of LLMs with… external mechanisms…”  \n    These sections articulate advantages and telecom relevance but do not systematically position these methods against alternatives in terms of architecture, objectives, or assumptions.\n\n  - Section 3.6 (Evaluation and Optimization Strategies) discusses self-improvement, cognitive agents, and iterative data enhancement, again with benefits and rationale, but lacks explicit cross-technique comparisons or trade-offs.\n\n- High-level framing without deeper cross-method contrasts:\n  - Section 1.3 (Architectural Foundations and Key Features) mentions efficiency techniques like “Activation-aware Weight Quantization (AWQ), LoRA, and Agile-Quant quantization techniques,” but provides no explicit comparative analysis among them regarding accuracy trade-offs, latency, hardware assumptions, or deployment constraints in telecom.  \n  - Section 2.4 (Integration and Deployment in Telecommunications) describes AI-native architectures, edge computing, and cloud-edge collaborations, but does not explicitly contrast trade-offs (e.g., privacy vs. performance vs. cost) in a structured manner across these integration strategies.\n\nIn summary, while the survey does discuss advantages and disadvantages and, in places (notably Section 1.4), offers a well-structured comparison, the broader treatment of methods tends to be descriptive and segmented by technique. It does not consistently provide a systematic, multi-dimensional comparison across architecture, objectives, assumptions, and telecom-specific constraints. This aligns with a score of 3: mentions pros/cons and differences, but the comparison is partially fragmented and lacks sufficient technical depth in contrasting methods.", "Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey provides broad coverage of architectures, training methods, deployment patterns, and telecom applications, and it occasionally touches on trade-offs and limitations. However, the analysis is more often descriptive than deeply analytical, with limited technically grounded explanations of underlying mechanisms, assumptions, and fundamental causes of differences between methods. Depth is uneven across sections, and synthesis across research lines is present but not robust.\n\nEvidence from specific sections and sentences:\n\n- Section 2.2 Architecture of LLMs:\n  - The paper explains mechanisms at a high level (“LoRA addresses the challenge of reducing the number of trainable parameters by integrating trainable rank decomposition matrices…” and “Quantization presents another architectural innovation aimed at optimizing the practical deployment of LLMs by reducing the precision of the weights…”). While this is technically correct, it does not analyze fundamental causes and design trade-offs such as accuracy degradation under different quantization schemes (per-channel vs per-tensor), stability issues from activation outliers, or how LoRA rank selection impacts task performance and memory bandwidth. There is little discussion of assumptions (e.g., stationarity of telecom task distributions) or detailed limitations (e.g., calibration and outlier handling required for low-bit quantization).\n  - The mention of “integration of neuro-symbolic AI… boosts interpretability and decision-making accuracy” is promising but lacks critical analysis of the integration’s complexity, failure modes (symbolic constraints conflicting with learned policies), and performance trade-offs.\n\n- Section 2.3 Training Methodologies:\n  - Lists methods—pre-training, instruction-tuning, hierarchical models, federated learning, data-efficient techniques—with brief benefits (“Federated learning offers a decentralized model training approach… aligning with telecom regulations”). Missing are underlying causes and trade-offs such as client heterogeneity and drift in federated settings, privacy-utility trade-offs under differential privacy, and assumptions about data distribution and edge-device capabilities. The commentary remains largely descriptive without dissecting why these methods differ in robustness or efficiency for telecom workloads.\n\n- Section 2.4 Integration and Deployment in Telecommunications:\n  - Provides cloud-edge collaboration rationale (“combination of the computational power of cloud services and the low-latency benefits of edge computing”), but does not analyze fundamental constraints like bandwidth costs (“data gravity”), latency SLAs, model partitioning strategies (tensor/pipeline parallelism vs inference offloading), or the operational trade-offs in cloud-edge orchestration (e.g., state consistency, failure handling).\n\n- Section 2.5 Enhancing Data Processing and Automation:\n  - Offers an interpretive insight by proposing hybrid RL + transactional stream processing (“By synergizing reinforcement learning with transactional stream processing… achieve optimal automation”). However, it does not explain core causal mechanisms (e.g., how reward shaping interacts with streaming consistency, exploration-exploitation under tight SLAs), nor does it evaluate assumptions or limitations (e.g., stability under non-stationary traffic, cost of continuous updates).\n\n- Section 3.1 Prompt Engineering:\n  - Acknowledges limitations (“prompt engineering comes with limitations, requiring a deep understanding of model behavior”), but lacks analysis of why prompt brittleness occurs (e.g., sensitivity to lexical form, distribution drift), or trade-offs between controllability and safety. The discussion remains generic.\n\n- Section 3.4 Integration with Domain-Specific Knowledge Bases:\n  - Provides better critical analysis than average segments by identifying challenges (“computational overhead… initial setup demands rigorous alignment between knowledge base schemas and LLM architectures”). Still, deeper causes and trade-offs (retrieval latency vs response quality, recall/precision balance in index design, stale index risks in fast-changing standards) are not explored.\n\n- Section 3.5 Tool-Augmented LLMs:\n  - Points out practical concerns (biases, computational constraints, real-time adaptability) and ethics (“data privacy and security”), but does not dissect detailed failure modes (e.g., tool-call orchestration errors, error propagation in multi-tool pipelines) or quantified trade-offs (latency overhead vs accuracy gains).\n\n- Section 5.1 Data Privacy and Security Issues:\n  - Offers technically grounded points (“model inversion attacks… differential privacy, secure multi-party computation, encrypted inference”), showing some genuine analysis of threats and mitigations. However, it omits trade-offs and fundamental causes such as utility loss under DP, computation/latency overhead of SMPC/encrypted inference, and operational assumptions (e.g., adversary capabilities).\n\n- Section 5.2 Computational Demands and Sustainability:\n  - Discusses energy and scalability concerns (“training a single large model can result in considerable carbon emissions”), but does not analyze the scaling laws, throughput-latency-energy trade-offs, or concrete serving strategies beyond high-level mentions. The commentary remains broad and lacks mechanistic detail.\n\n- Section 7.5 Impact of Model Scaling and Training Techniques:\n  - States that scaling improves performance (“GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 showcase substantial improvements”) and mentions LoRA/RAG. Missing are deeper causal explanations (e.g., the empirical scaling laws governing loss vs compute/data, diminishing returns, data quality effects, capacity vs generalization trade-offs) and quantified analysis of telecom-specific workloads.\n\nSynthesis across research lines:\n- There are connections made (e.g., combining RL with stream processing in 2.5; tool-augmented LLMs with transaction processing in 3.5; cloud-edge synergies in 2.4), but the synthesis is usually at a conceptual level. The review seldom reconciles conflicting findings or systematically explains why certain methods (e.g., RAG vs fine-tuning) dominate under specific telecom constraints (e.g., fast document churn, strict latency SLAs).\n\nInterpretive insights:\n- The survey occasionally offers interpretive commentary (e.g., hybrid RL + TSP, AI-native systems, intent-based networking in 4.5), but these are not consistently supported by deep causal or empirical analysis. Many claims remain normative or general, without unpacking assumptions, limitations, and fundamental design trade-offs.\n\nConclusion:\nOverall, the review includes some analytical remarks and identifies certain challenges and high-level trade-offs, but it largely emphasizes descriptive summaries and domain-adaptation narratives. It does not consistently provide deep, technically grounded explanations of why methods differ, the root causes of limitations, or rigorous synthesis across research lines. Hence, a score of 3 reflects basic analytical content with relatively shallow depth, uneven reasoning, and limited interpretive insight beyond description.", "Score: 4/5\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey identifies a broad and relevant set of research gaps and future directions across data, methods, systems, and governance dimensions, and it often explains why these issues matter for telecommunications. However, the analysis is dispersed across sections rather than consolidated into a dedicated “Gap/Future Work” section, and while many gaps are articulated, several discussions remain high-level without consistently deep analysis of impacts or concrete research agendas. Below are specific parts of the paper that support this evaluation.\n\n- Data-related gaps and their impacts:\n  - Low-resource and multilingual challenges: In 3.3 Multilingual Capabilities, the paper notes “Ensuring translation accuracy and context retention, particularly for languages with complex syntax or limited resources, is a significant task” and ties this to data privacy and supply chain issues, highlighting implications for global service quality and inclusivity. Section 8.4 Enhancing Capabilities for Future Opportunities reiterates “many models currently struggle with low-resource languages,” emphasizing why this matters to worldwide telecom operations.\n  - Data integrity and contamination: In 7.6 Data Integrity and Contamination, the review outlines biases in language samples and annotation errors, connecting them to unreliable evaluations and misaligned deployments. It stresses adherence to FAIR principles and provenance, explaining the impact on trustworthy benchmarking and model selection in telecom contexts.\n  - RAG data reliability: In 6.5 Retrieval-Augmented Language Models in Telecom, it flags “ensuring the reliability and credibility of information retrieved,” and the need for cross-verifying and reliability scoring, directly linking the gap to the correctness of outputs in standards-heavy telecom work.\n\n- Methodological gaps and impacts:\n  - Real-time updates and continual learning: In 2.5 Enhancing Data Processing and Automation, the paper states “The main challenge lies in maintaining accuracy without the need for full retraining” for real-time updates, and proposes transactional stream processing (TStreamLLM). This pinpoints a concrete methodological gap with operational impact on latency and accuracy in live telecom systems.\n  - Parameter-efficient fine-tuning and domain adaptation: 3.2 Fine-Tuning and Specialized Training and 2.2 Architecture of LLMs detail LoRA, quantization, and neuro-symbolic integration as promising techniques, but the survey implicitly recognizes the gap in robust domain adaptation pipelines for telecom jargon and standards. 4.4 Telecom Standards and Document Processing further underscores the need for specialized models (e.g., TeleRoBERTa) due to technical nomenclature and compliance requirements.\n  - Cognitive architectures and reasoning: In 4.7 Challenges and Innovations in Domain-Specific Applications, it explicitly poses the question “Can cognitive architectures fundamentally enhance LLMs,” positioning this as a forward-looking gap for complex protocol reasoning and decision support, with direct implications for automated network management.\n\n- Systems, infrastructure, and optimization gaps:\n  - Computational demands and sustainability: Section 5.2 Computational Demands and Sustainability explains energy-intensive training/serving, scalability, and infrastructure constraints, linking them to environmental impact, operational cost, and feasibility for telecom operators. 8.5 Addressing Sustainability in LLM Deployment proposes smaller optimized models, edge computing, and incremental learning, articulating both the problem and plausible paths forward.\n  - Edge/cloud orchestration and latency: 2.4 Integration and Deployment in Telecommunications and 6.5 RAG in Telecom outline tensions between cloud power and edge latency/privacy needs, and in 6.5 explicitly note “minimizing latency and ensuring throughput are pivotal,” clarifying the impact on real-time network functions and customer experience.\n  - Evaluation and benchmarking gaps for telecom tasks: 7.3 Domain-Specific Benchmarking states general-purpose benchmarks are insufficient and stresses the need for telecom-specific tasks (protocol understanding, standards processing, intent detection) and efficiency metrics, linking this to better model selection and deployment outcomes in industry.\n\n- Governance, ethics, and security gaps:\n  - Privacy and security: 5.1 Data Privacy and Security Issues covers data leakage, malicious text generation, and inference vulnerabilities (model inversion), and proposes differential privacy, encrypted inference, and XAI. It explains impacts on user trust, regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR), and service reliability.\n  - Bias and fairness: 5.3 Bias, Fairness, and Ethical Model Alignment discusses training data imbalances, multilingual inequities, and the consequences for service delivery and compliance. It suggests evaluation frameworks and dataset auditing, tying fairness to customer satisfaction and regulatory scrutiny.\n  - Regulatory and accountability: 5.4 Regulatory and Accountability Issues articulates needs for transparency, explainability, audits, liability delineation, and standardization, and connects these gaps to operational risk and consumer trust in telecom contexts.\n\n- Future directions and their importance:\n  - 8.1 Advancements in Semantic Communications and 8.3 LLMs in Next-Generation Network Architectures articulate forward-looking opportunities (intent-based networking, AI-native 6G), and explain why they matter (efficiency, responsiveness, autonomy), though the methodological roadmaps are more aspirational than detailed.\n  - 8.2 Integration with Multi-Modal Systems and 8.4 Rethinking User Engagement with LLMs identify opportunities and associated challenges (computational scale, privacy), and highlight impacts on monitoring, personalization, and customer satisfaction.\n\nWhy this is a 4 and not a 5:\n- Breadth is strong, and the survey touches data, methods, systems, and governance. However, the analysis is often distributed and sometimes high-level; there is no consolidated “Gap/Future Work” section that systematically itemizes each gap, explains root causes, and maps concrete research questions and methodologies. For example:\n  - Real-time updating and TSP are identified (2.5), but a deeper examination of specific continual learning strategies, evaluation protocols for staleness, and measurable impacts across telecom workloads is limited.\n  - Multilingual low-resource gaps are noted (3.3, 8.4), but the survey does not fully outline robust data creation, transfer-learning strategies, or cross-lingual evaluation metrics tailored to telecom tasks.\n  - Sustainability is well-motivated (5.2, 8.5), yet the discussion of energy/performance trade-off quantification in telecom deployment scenarios and standardized reporting practices remains brief.\n- Overall, while the paper clearly surfaces many relevant gaps and often explains why they matter, the depth and systematic mapping of impacts and research agendas is not consistently comprehensive across all identified issues. Hence, it merits 4/5: comprehensive identification with generally sound analysis, but not uniformly deep across all gaps.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey proposes several forward-looking research directions grounded in clearly articulated gaps and real-world telecom needs, but it stops short of offering deeply elaborated, fully actionable research roadmaps for each topic. Overall, it identifies the main problem areas and maps them to plausible, innovative directions, with multiple specific suggestions and telecom-centric applications. The analysis of potential impact is present but often brief, and the discussion of root causes and methodological pathways could be more detailed. Below are the key parts that support this score:\n\n- Clear identification of gaps and real-world constraints:\n  - Section 5 (Challenges and Ethical Considerations):\n    - 5.1 Data Privacy and Security Issues explicitly details risks like data leakage, malicious generation, inference vulnerabilities, and calls for differential privacy, encrypted inference, and regulatory alignment (“adopting guidelines aligned with existing standards such as the EU’s GDPR”).\n    - 5.2 Computational Demands and Sustainability highlights carbon footprint, scalability, and infrastructure limits, and points to efficient serving and edge-cloud strategies (“Towards Efficient Generative Large Language Model Serving” and AI-native approaches).\n    - 5.3 Bias, Fairness, and Ethical Model Alignment addresses demographic and linguistic biases and the need for fairness constraints and diversified evaluation sets.\n    - 5.4 Regulatory and Accountability Issues calls out explainability, audits, liability delineation, standardization, and environmental impact regulations.\n  - Section 7 (Evaluation and Performance Metrics):\n    - 7.1–7.3 lay out evaluation gaps, proposing domain-specific metrics, benchmarking for telecom tasks (e.g., intent detection, protocol understanding), and sustainability-aware metrics.\n    - 7.6 Data Integrity and Contamination addresses dataset curation, FAIR principles, provenance, and hybrid human-machine evaluation to counter bias and contamination.\n\n- Specific, forward-looking research directions aligned to these gaps:\n  - Section 8 Opportunities and Future Directions:\n    - 8.1 Advancements in Semantic Communications proposes LLM-driven intent-based networking for 6G, context/intent-aware transmission, and integrating LLMs with Knowledge Graphs (“unifying LLMs and Knowledge Graphs” for semantic depth and accuracy). It links directly to bandwidth efficiency and dynamic telecom needs.\n    - 8.2 Integration with Multi-Modal Systems recommends multi-modal LLMs for real-time monitoring (video/audio/sensors), anomaly detection, resource allocation, and personalized user interactions—grounded in telecom operational visibility needs.\n    - 8.3 LLMs in Next-Generation Network Architectures advocates AI-native, intent-driven automation, multi-modal adaptability, and edge deployment; it directly addresses resource constraints via quantization and LoRA (“ensure energy-efficient implementations without compromising model performance”).\n    - 8.4 Rethinking User Engagement with LLMs targets personalization, interactive dialogues, in-context learning, and multi-modal perception—responding to global, multilingual customer support demands and cognitive load reduction.\n    - 8.5 Addressing Sustainability in LLM Deployment suggests smaller models (e.g., Phi-2 + retrieval), edge computing, incremental/transfer learning, hardware lifecycle management, and sustainability-focused regulation—explicitly addressing the environmental and operational constraints from 5.2.\n    - 8.6 Collaborations and Interdisciplinary Research Opportunities proposes cross-disciplinary frameworks (linguistics, ethics, policy, engineering), multimodal advances, and energy-efficient designs, mapping to regulatory, ethical, and sustainability gaps noted in Section 5.\n  - Section 9 (Conclusion):\n    - 9.2 Importance of Ongoing Research links ethical deployment, efficient serving, AI-native architectures, multimodality, and fairness to telecom realities (low latency, high throughput, global regulation).\n    - 9.4 Enhancing Capabilities for Future Opportunities provides concrete topics: improving low-resource language support (“MaLA-500”), multi-modal extensions, tool-augmented LLMs (RAG, knowledge graphs), efficiency techniques (quantization, pruning), semantic communications in 6G, and ethical deployment. These are actionable directions that directly address earlier-identified gaps (e.g., 5.3 bias; 5.2 sustainability; 5.1 privacy).\n\n- Telecom-specific, innovative case-driven directions:\n  - Section 6 (Case Studies and Real-World Implementations):\n    - 6.5 Retrieval-Augmented Language Models in Telecom and 6.1/6.2 show how RAG and tool integration (e.g., TStreamLLM for transactional stream processing) deal with “ever-changing world knowledge” and real-time constraints raised earlier.\n    - 6.3 Mobility Management in Dense Networks and 6.4 Churn Prediction Using Social Network Analytics propose LLM-driven predictive handover management and social-network-informed churn prevention—both concrete new research/application topics tailored to telecom.\n    - 4.6 Traffic Management and Control (TrafficGPT) introduces a multi-modal decision support paradigm for smart city traffic—innovative, applicable, and methodologically linked to multi-modal research in 8.2.\n\nWhy this is a 4, not a 5:\n- While the survey consistently ties gaps to future work and offers multiple specific directions (semantic communications in 6G, multi-modal LLMs, transactional stream processing, edge deployment, domain-specific benchmarks, tool-augmented LLMs, sustainability strategies), the depth of analysis of root causes and the provision of detailed, actionable research roadmaps (e.g., explicit experimental designs, standardized protocols, quantified target metrics, phased deployment guidance) are limited. Many directions, though relevant and innovative in telecom context, are still presented at a high level (e.g., “integrating LLMs with Knowledge Graphs” or “improving low-resource language performance”) without thorough methodological pathways or impact quantification. Therefore, it meets most criteria for forward-looking relevance and innovation but lacks the fully fleshed, actionable path and exhaustive impact analysis needed for a 5."]}
{"name": "f", "paperold": [5, 4, 4, 4]}
{"name": "f", "paperour": [3, 4, 2, 4, 4, 3, 4], "reason": ["Score: 3/5\n\nExplanation:\n- Research Objective Clarity:\n  - Strengths: The paper’s intent to survey “principles, key techniques, and opportunities” for LLMs in telecommunications is implicit in the title and reiterated in the first paragraph of Section 1 Introduction (“This introduction highlights the remarkable journey and current landscape of LLMs within the telecommunications industry, elaborating on their principles, techniques, and untapped potential.”).\n  - Gaps: The Introduction does not state a concrete, explicit research objective or articulate formal research questions, scope, or contributions. There is no “our contributions are…” or “this survey aims to…” statement, nor a roadmap of the paper in the Introduction to orient the reader. The absence of an Abstract exacerbates this, as there is no concise up-front articulation of objectives, methods, or key findings. Overall, the objective remains broad and somewhat implied rather than specific and operationalized, which diminishes clarity of research direction.\n\n- Background and Motivation:\n  - Strengths: The Introduction provides a solid contextual background and motivation. It traces the evolution from n-grams and early neural models to transformers (e.g., “Initially, traditional models struggled… however, advancements in deep learning and transformer architectures have paved the way…”), highlights domain-specific drivers (telemetry interpretation, customer service automation, fraud detection), and identifies salient telecom challenges (computational overhead, domain adaptation across geographies/regulations). It also foregrounds methods like transformer models [2] and RAG [4] and previews emerging trends (IoT integration [7], cross-lingual transfer and multimodality [8]). These elements show strong motivation tied to real telecom needs (“interpret complex telemetry data,” “real-time insights,” “energy-aware deployment strategies,” “regulatory contexts”).\n  - Gaps: While the motivation is well supported, it does not segue into a precise statement of how this survey will systematically address gaps (e.g., taxonomy, evaluation criteria, selection methodology for included works). Thus, the link from background to a specific objective and plan remains incomplete.\n\n- Practical Significance and Guidance Value:\n  - Strengths: The Introduction emphasizes practical relevance across multiple operational domains: customer service automation, fraud detection, real-time telemetry analysis, and network optimization; it flags concrete enablers like RAG and domain adaptation and anticipates future integrations (IoT, cross-lingual, multimodal). Phrases such as “offering real-time insights that are crucial for network efficiency and resilience,” “supporting dynamic interactions,” and “enhancing the accuracy and relevance of telecom-related responses” demonstrate applied benefits and guidance potential.\n  - Gaps: Despite strong practical motivation, the Introduction does not articulate explicit guidance elements (e.g., a framework, taxonomy, or set of research questions that the survey will answer) that would help practitioners or researchers navigate the rest of the paper. There is no preview of structure or criteria (e.g., “In this survey we categorize techniques into X/Y/Z and assess them along metrics A/B/C”), which would strengthen the guidance value.\n\nWhy this score:\n- The paper presents a compelling and well-contextualized motivation with evident practical significance (clear descriptions of telecom-specific needs, challenges, and trends). However, the research objective remains implicit rather than explicitly and specifically stated, and the lack of an Abstract further reduces clarity. The Introduction also does not outline contributions, scope, methodology, or a roadmap. These gaps align with a 3-point assessment: the objective is present but somewhat vague; motivation is strong, but the direction and explicit objectives are not clearly delineated.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe paper presents a relatively clear and reasonable classification of methods and a mostly coherent account of methodological evolution, especially across Sections 2 and 3. It effectively reflects the technological development path in LLMs and their adoption in telecommunications, although some connections and staging are not fully explicit and there is occasional overlap.\n\nStrengths supporting the score:\n- Clear high-level taxonomy from core model design to adaptation and deployment:\n  - Section 2 “Fundamental Principles of Large Language Models” organizes the foundational content into coherent subsections: 2.1 Architectural Frameworks, 2.2 Operational Mechanics, 2.3 Transfer Learning and Domain Adaptation, 2.4 Knowledge Graphs and Information Retrieval Integration, and 2.5 Ethical Considerations and Security. This is a logical progression from model architectures and their mechanics to adaptation and knowledge integration.\n  - Section 3 “Key Techniques for Model Integration and Deployment” follows with applied and system-level techniques: 3.1 Fine-tuning and Domain Adaptation, 3.2 Resource Management and Efficiency, 3.3 Integration with Legacy Systems, and 3.4 Deployment Frameworks and Best Practices. This reflects the path from methodology to operationalization in telecom.\n\n- Systematic presentation of evolution within core methods:\n  - Section 2.1 traces the architectural evolution clearly: “Initially, language models relied heavily on statistical methods and techniques such as n-gram models [9]” → “The advent of neural network-based language models represented a significant leap” → “The transformer architecture marked a paradigm shift” with self-attention and large parameter models [2]. It then mentions “Emerging trends in model design… such as sparse transformers and efficient transformer variants” [5], and “Mixture of Experts” [11], signaling the trajectory toward efficiency and specialization.\n  - Section 2.2 explicitly builds on 2.1: “Building upon earlier discussions about transformer architectures, the sequence-to-sequence generation implemented by these models is crucial…” and introduces evolution in mechanics such as “window attention and sparse attention frameworks” [17].\n  - Section 2.3 shows method evolution from generic pre-training to domain-specific fine-tuning (“The foremost strategy for transfer learning involves adapting pre-trained models…” [18]), parameter-efficient techniques (“Domain-specialized fine-tuning… without extensive retraining” [19]; references to PEFT in Section 3.1), and cross-lingual transfer (“An exciting frontier… cross-lingual transfer learning” [21]).\n  - Section 2.4 progresses to knowledge-enhanced approaches: “Knowledge-enhanced LLMs… leveraging structured information encoded within knowledge graphs” [6] and “Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enable LLMs to access and blend diverse external information sources in real-time” [12].\n  - Section 3.1 consolidates adaptation methods, clearly distinguishing “Fine-tuning,” “low-rank adaptation (LoRA)” [35], and “Instruction tuning” [3], with a comparative view and noting “Emerging trends indicate a shift towards hybrid methods integrating both fine-tuning and instruction tuning… and continual learning” [36].\n  - Section 3.2 outlines efficiency evolution at system scale: “Megatron-LM [37]… pipeline parallelism,” “model compression—pruning and quantization” [38], “mixed-precision training” [38], and “hardware acceleration… FPGAs” [40], capturing the trajectory toward scalable and resource-efficient deployment.\n\n- The survey frequently signals evolution and trends explicitly:\n  - Phrases like “Emerging trends…” in 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4, and “Looking forward…” in 3.1 and 3.4 demonstrate the authors’ intent to reveal methodological direction over time.\n  - The cross-referencing between sections (e.g., 2.2 building on 2.1; 3.1 and 3.2 dovetailing with earlier discussions) shows a conscious effort to connect categories and evolution.\n\nLimitations preventing a score of 5:\n- Overlap and boundary blurring between categories:\n  - Fine-tuning and domain adaptation are treated in both 2.3 and 3.1. While Section 2 frames them as principles and Section 3 as deployment techniques, the duplication blurs the taxonomy boundary and could be streamlined into a single, staged narrative.\n- Some evolutionary connections are underdeveloped:\n  - Section 2.4 combines knowledge graphs and RAG effectively but does not articulate a chronological or causal evolution within telecom (e.g., how telecom-specific RAG/knowledge integration matured over time, adoption stages, or standards influence). Although it notes “A promising enhancement in RAG involves retrieval-augmented transformers,” it lacks a structured depiction of progression specific to telecom.\n  - Section 2.5 (ethics/security) is important but interrupts the methodological thread, as it shifts from methods to constraints without tying back to how ethical/security considerations influenced method evolution or classifications over time.\n- Missing explicit mapping of methods to telecom development stages:\n  - While the paper mentions telecom contexts, it does not provide a staged timeline or layered framework connecting method families (e.g., architectures → adaptation → knowledge integration → efficiency/deployment) to telecom-specific milestones (e.g., standards, legacy integration phases, 5G/6G adoption curves). For example, Mixture of Experts (2.1) is introduced but not revisited in resource efficiency (3.2) or telecom-specific deployment considerations.\n  - Techniques like window/sparse attention introduced in 2.2 are not explicitly tied to the resource management strategies in 3.2, which would show stronger coherence in the evolutionary narrative across sections.\n\nOverall judgment:\nThe method classification is relatively clear and reflects the technology development path from foundational architectures to adaptation and systems deployment. The evolution is presented and trends are discussed across sections, but some connections are implicit rather than explicit, certain categories overlap, and the telecom-specific staging of methodological evolution could be more systematically articulated. Hence, a score of 4 is appropriate.", "2\n\nExplanation:\n- Diversity of datasets: The survey provides very limited coverage of concrete datasets. Aside from citing TeleQnA [25] in multiple places (e.g., Section 2.4 “Knowledge Graphs and Information Retrieval Integration” references TeleQnA: “TeleQnA A Benchmark Dataset to Assess Large Language Models Telecommunications Knowledge”), the paper does not enumerate or describe other telecom-relevant datasets. It does not cover speech corpora used in telecom (e.g., call center ASR datasets), multilingual customer support dialog datasets, network telemetry/log datasets, standards corpora (e.g., 3GPP/ETSI text collections) with details on scale, labeling, or application scenarios. Sections 4.3 mention Dispatcher [48] and Seed-ASR [49], but these are model papers, not datasets, and no dataset descriptions accompany them. This falls short of the “variety of datasets” criterion.\n\n- Detail on datasets: There are no dataset-specific descriptions (size, domains, labeling methodology, languages covered, access modality). Even the only named dataset, TeleQnA [25], is not characterized in terms of scale, composition, annotation procedure, or benchmarking protocols. As such, the survey lacks the detailed dataset coverage expected for a high score.\n\n- Diversity and rationality of metrics: The paper introduces several high-level, domain-oriented metric ideas in Section 7:\n  - Section 7.1 “Benchmarking Techniques” discusses the need for “telecom-specific benchmarks” and “dynamic environment adaptation benchmarks,” but does not specify concrete benchmark suites or standard task metrics.\n  - Section 7.2 “Custom Evaluation Metrics for Telecom” proposes conceptual metrics such as “Telecom-Specific Accuracy Metric,” “Latency and real-time processing” metrics, “Integration and Interoperability Scores,” and “resource management efficiency.” These are reasonable directions but remain abstract. There are no formal definitions, measurement procedures, or references to established evaluation practices for LLMs in telecom.\n  - Section 7.4 “Security and Privacy Considerations” mentions “data privacy metrics,” “security compliance checks,” and “risk assessment models,” again at a conceptual level without concrete operationalization or widely used quantitative measures.\n  - Section 7.5 “Continuous Evaluation and Lifecycle Assessment” emphasizes adaptive monitoring and feedback loops but does not anchor these to specific measurable KPIs or industry-standard evaluation protocols.\n\n- Missing established metrics: The review does not connect telecom tasks to widely accepted evaluation metrics. For example:\n  - QA/knowledge tasks: exact match/F1, factuality/faithfulness scores for RAG, retrieval metrics like Recall@k, MRR, nDCG@k are not presented.\n  - ASR/speech tasks: WER/CER, MOS, PESQ are not mentioned despite relevance in Sections 4.3.\n  - Translation: BLEU, COMET, or other quality metrics are absent while real-time translation is discussed in Section 4.3.\n  - Dialogue/customer service: intent accuracy, slot F1, CSAT proxy metrics, first-contact resolution rates are not covered, though Section 4.1 discusses customer service and personalization.\n  - Network ops: latency distributions (p50/p95/p99), throughput, SLA adherence, QoS/QoE KPIs (jitter, packet loss, PRB utilization) are not articulated, despite Section 4.2 and 5.5 discussing real-time constraints.\n  - Resource/efficiency: energy per inference, tokens/sec, GPU-hours, memory footprint are not quantified even though Section 3.2 and 5.2 raise resource concerns.\n\n- Practical applicability: While the proposed metric categories in Section 7.2 are aligned with telecom needs (latency, interoperability, resource efficiency), they do not provide actionable measurement frameworks or mappings from specific tasks to metrics. The rationale for these metrics is present at a high level (e.g., meeting real-time demands, ensuring compatibility with legacy systems), but academic soundness requires operational definitions and standardized measurement protocols, which are missing.\n\nOverall, the paper’s treatment of datasets and metrics is more conceptual than concrete. It identifies important evaluation dimensions for telecom LLMs but does not comprehensively cover existing datasets nor detail established evaluation metrics and methodologies. This aligns with a score of 2 under the provided rubric.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nOverall, the survey provides clear, multi-method comparisons with identified pros/cons and trade-offs across several subsections, but the comparisons are not fully systematic across multiple dimensions and occasionally remain at a high level.\n\nEvidence of strengths in structured comparison:\n- Section 3.1 (Fine-tuning and Domain Adaptation) explicitly contrasts fine-tuning, LoRA, and instruction tuning with clear advantages and disadvantages and distinct objectives and assumptions. For example: “Comparatively analyzing these approaches reveals several strengths and challenges. Fine-tuning provides comprehensive domain embedding at the cost of computational and data demands. Meanwhile, domain-specific methodologies like LoRA offer scalable solutions… Instruction tuning fosters model flexibility, albeit it can sometimes lead to overfitting…” This shows method-level distinctions, resource assumptions, and risk (overfitting), satisfying the requirement to compare methods across objectives and constraints.\n- Section 3.2 (Resource Management and Efficiency) presents a comparative viewpoint across scaling techniques and efficiency strategies: “Comparative analyses of these approaches highlight distinct advantages and limitations. Model parallelism and pipeline techniques are effective at scaling operations but may introduce latency… Conversely, model compression and hardware acceleration provide immediate gains in energy efficiency and cost reduction, though they may necessitate substantial initial investments…” This contrasts methods across dimensions such as scalability, latency, energy, and cost.\n- Section 2.4 (Knowledge Graphs and Information Retrieval Integration) discusses trade-offs and contrasts among knowledge graphs, RAG, and retrieval-augmented transformers. It states: “Trade-offs between computational overhead and performance gains… While incorporating retrieval mechanisms indeed increases processing demands, the resultant semantic accuracy and informed contextual knowledge significantly outweigh these costs…” and distinguishes approaches (“Complementing the knowledge graph approach, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems…” and “retrieval-augmented transformers…”). This frames similarities (knowledge-enhanced reasoning) and distinctions (retrieval timing/integration) with context-specific benefits and costs.\n- Section 2.1 (Architectural Frameworks) compares modeling paradigms (n-gram, neural networks, transformers) and discusses emerging variants: “Initially… n-gram models… limited… The advent of neural network-based language models… The transformer architecture marked a paradigm shift…” It further differentiates efficiency-oriented designs: “Innovations such as sparse transformers and efficient transformer variants propose reductions in computational overhead…” and architecture-specific scaling strategies (“Mixture of Experts architectures…”). These passages identify architectural differences, objectives (efficiency, scalability), and constraints (computational demand).\n- Section 3.3 (Integration with Legacy Systems) contrasts integration strategies and their trade-offs: “API and middleware solutions… compatibility layer or abstraction layer… progressive upgradation strategies…” and acknowledges risks: “trade-offs… balancing innovation with stability… necessitates robust testing and validation frameworks…” This shows method choices, their distinct roles, and operational implications.\n\nWhere the comparison falls short (justifying a score of 4 rather than 5):\n- The comparisons, while clear, are distributed across subsections without a unified, systematic framework that consistently applies multiple dimensions (e.g., modeling perspective, data dependency, learning strategy, application scenario, and architectural assumptions) to each method. There is no consolidated taxonomy or matrix-style synthesis.\n- Some sections are descriptive rather than comparative. For instance, Section 2.2 (Operational Mechanics) largely explains tokenization, embeddings, attention, and adaptation (“Tokenization… Contextual embeddings… Attention mechanisms… sequence-to-sequence generation… Dynamic adaptation…”) without contrasting alternative mechanisms or explicitly analyzing pros/cons across competing approaches for telecom-specific workloads.\n- Section 2.3 (Transfer Learning and Domain Adaptation) focuses on general techniques (domain-specific fine-tuning, cross-lingual transfer) and challenges but does not deeply contrast parameter-efficient adaptation methods versus full fine-tuning within telecom constraints (this more detailed contrast appears in Section 3.1, but 2.3 itself is largely expository).\n- The survey’s comparisons are mostly qualitative; there is limited use of quantitative benchmarks or explicit telecom-focused evaluation metrics to ground differences, and several claims remain at a relatively high level (e.g., “sparse attention and window attention address limitations by optimizing models to handle longer contexts…” in Section 2.2, without deeper exploration of trade-offs specific to telecom traffic patterns or SLAs).\n- Some subsections (e.g., Section 3.4, Deployment Frameworks) mention framework choices (“ONNX Runtime… TensorFlow Serving… Prometheus…”) and best practices but provide less detailed, structured comparisons among deployment options beyond brief remarks on interoperability and microservices.\n\nIn summary, the paper delivers clear, technically grounded comparisons in multiple places (especially Sections 3.1, 3.2, 2.4, and 2.1), articulating advantages, disadvantages, and trade-offs. However, it lacks a consistently applied, multi-dimensional comparative framework across all methods and occasionally remains descriptive, which aligns with a 4-point score under the provided criteria.", "Score: 4/5\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey offers meaningful analytical interpretation of method differences and several technically grounded trade-off discussions, but the depth is uneven across sections and some arguments remain underdeveloped.\n\nWhere the analysis is strong:\n- Section 2.1 (Architectural Frameworks of Large Language Models) goes beyond description by explaining the fundamental cause of transformer superiority via “self-attention mechanisms that enable models to prioritize context [2]” and linking that to telecom’s “dynamic nature of telecommunications data.” It also recognizes a key limitation—“the computational demand required for their operation can be a barrier” and proposes directions like “sparse transformers and efficient transformer variants [5]” and “Mixture of Experts … to facilitate highly adaptable, task-specific processing without extensive computational load [11].” These are design trade-offs and mechanism-level causes (attention vs. context, compute vs. latency) tied to domain needs.\n- Section 2.4 (Knowledge Graphs and Information Retrieval Integration) explicitly examines trade-offs (“Trade-offs between computational overhead and performance gains arising from enhanced contextual accuracy are notable”), offers technically grounded commentary on why RAG reduces hallucinations (“integrates a retrieval layer that dynamically queries external databases … to supply relevant facts [12]”), and synthesizes how knowledge graphs/RAG mitigate domain accuracy issues in telecom standards.\n- Section 3.1 (Fine-tuning and Domain Adaptation) compares methods and articulates assumptions/limitations: it contrasts full fine-tuning with parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (“LoRA … enhancing model adaptability while significantly conserving computational resources and time [35]”) and flags risks (“Instruction tuning … can sometimes lead to overfitting if the task instructions are too narrowly defined [35]”) and longer-term concerns (“catastrophic forgetting [36]”), which shows reflective commentary on design trade-offs and lifecycle implications.\n- Section 3.2 (Resource Management and Efficiency) provides a clear analysis of systems-scale trade-offs: it contrasts model/pipeline parallelism with compression/quantization (“effective at scaling operations but may introduce latency … Conversely, … energy efficiency … though … substantial initial investments [41]”), connects approaches (Megatron-LM, mixed precision, FPGAs) to telecom constraints, and offers interpretive insights (“Balancing computational demand with efficient resource use is essential for sustaining telecom operations long-term [38]”).\n\nWhere the analysis is weaker or mostly descriptive:\n- Section 2.2 (Operational Mechanics) explains tokenization, embeddings, attention, and sequence-to-sequence in largely descriptive terms. While it mentions emerging strategies (“window attention and sparse attention frameworks”), it does not unpack the underlying mechanisms (e.g., the O(n^2) cost of attention or how windowed/sparse attention changes locality and memory footprints) or assumptions in telecom workloads.\n- Section 2.3 (Transfer Learning and Domain Adaptation) acknowledges alignment risks (“alignment of pre-trained knowledge with specific domain requirements … can result in sub-optimal performance or even system biases [22]”) and resource constraints, but provides limited analysis of the fundamental causes (e.g., domain shift properties in telecom logs vs. web corpora, label scarcity, multilingual code-switching peculiarities) or concrete design choices beyond high-level technique labels.\n- Section 3.3 (Integration with Legacy Systems) and Section 3.4 (Deployment Frameworks and Best Practices) discuss middleware, compatibility layers, ONNX/TensorFlow Serving, and monitoring/security in a largely pragmatic, descriptive way. They flag trade-offs (“balancing innovation with stability,” “operational and financial implications”) but do not deeply analyze technical assumptions (e.g., latency budgets of RPC-based microservices, schema evolution costs, consistency guarantees) or the causal mechanisms behind failure modes in legacy integration.\n\nSynthesis across research lines:\n- The survey does make cross-cutting connections—for example, linking architectural choices (transformers, sparse attention, MoE) to telecom constraints (latency, bandwidth, regulatory contexts) in 2.1, tying knowledge integration (RAG, knowledge graphs) to hallucination mitigation and standards compliance in 2.4, and aligning parameter-efficient adaptation (LoRA) and continual learning challenges to cost/resource limits in 3.1/3.2.\n- However, the synthesis is uneven and often remains at a high level. The paper rarely articulates deeper causal chains (e.g., how traffic heterogeneity and burstiness in telecom telemetry specifically stress context windows; how retrieval latency distributions affect end-to-end SLA in call centers; how MoE routing sparsity interacts with edge deployment and memory bandwidth limitations).\n\nTechnically grounded explanatory commentary:\n- Present in 2.1, 2.4, 3.1, 3.2 through identification of mechanisms (self-attention’s global context vs. compute cost; retrieval layers for factuality; parameter-efficient updates vs. catastrophic forgetting; parallelism vs. latency).\n- Less present in 2.2, 2.3, 3.3, 3.4 which mainly catalog techniques without delving into underlying system behavior, modeling assumptions, or quantitative constraints.\n\nOverall judgment:\n- The paper does extend beyond descriptive summary in several sections with interpretive insights and trade-off analyses, particularly around architecture, knowledge integration, adaptation, and systems efficiency. Yet the analytical depth is inconsistent and sometimes generic, lacking rigorous mechanism-level explanations or quantitative reasoning in multiple areas. Hence, a 4/5: strong in parts, but uneven and partially underdeveloped.\n\nResearch guidance value:\n- To strengthen critical analysis, the survey could:\n  - Quantify costs/benefits (e.g., attention complexity, memory bandwidth, energy per token) and connect them to telecom SLA targets.\n  - Analyze retrieval latency distributions and cache strategies for RAG in real-time telecom workloads.\n  - Discuss MoE routing sparsity and expert placement for edge vs. core deployments.\n  - Examine domain shift causes in telecom (noisy logs, code-switching, standards jargon) and their impact on alignment/PEFT choices.\n  - Provide a unifying framework mapping telecom constraints (latency, privacy, topology heterogeneity) to method selection (RAG vs. KG, LoRA vs. full FT, streaming attention vs. standard attention), with explicit assumptions and failure modes.", "3\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey does identify and discuss numerous challenges and future directions, but the analysis of research gaps is dispersed across sections rather than presented as a systematic, consolidated “Gap/Future Work” synthesis. While many important issues are mentioned, the depth of analysis regarding why each gap is critical and what specific impact it has on the field is uneven, with only some areas receiving detailed treatment. This fits a score of 3: several gaps are listed, but the analysis is not consistently deep, and their impacts and underlying reasons are not fully explored across all dimensions.\n\nEvidence supporting the score:\n- System-level and methodological gaps are identified and partially analyzed in Section 5 (Challenges and Limitations), which functions as the de facto research gaps section:\n  - 5.1 Scalability Challenges: “The primary challenge in scaling LLMs within telecom settings is managing the vast volumes of data… Current methods often struggle with real-time data processing capabilities essential for telecom networks, impacting the models' efficiency and responsiveness [5].” This explains the reason (data volume, real-time demands) and touches on impact (efficiency and responsiveness), with future directions (distributed computing and edge processing). However, the analysis remains high-level and does not deeply quantify or prioritize impacts.\n  - 5.2 Computational Overhead and Resource Constraints: “LLMs… require immense computational resources… especially in real-time applications… where latency and reliability are crucial [2; 62]… Energy consumption is a critical concern.” This identifies important constraints, reasons, and practical impacts (latency, energy costs), and notes candidate mitigations (hardware accelerators, sparse attention), but lacks a deeper exploration of trade-offs and concrete research agenda items.\n  - 5.3 Data Privacy and Security Risks: “Sensitive data handling is at the forefront… Aligning LLM operations with… GDPR and CCPA… LLMs pose inherent vulnerabilities to cyber attacks.” This section clearly articulates why privacy/security are crucial, referencing regulatory and threat landscapes, and suggests mitigation (intrusion detection, RAG), but it does not substantively analyze data-specific gaps such as dataset availability, anonymization techniques tailored to telecom logs, or cross-operator data sharing constraints.\n  - 5.4 Integration with Legacy Systems: “Interoperability… middleware… data format discrepancies… organizational resistance.” It describes causes and practical impacts (latency, disruption), and mitigation strategies (modular architectures), but remains descriptive rather than deeply analytical (e.g., lacks evaluation of which legacy patterns most impede LLM integration and how to prioritize fixes).\n  - 5.5 Latency and Real-time Processing Limitations: “Latency issues stem largely from the computational complexity of LLMs… co-design… edge computing.” This section gives a clear statement of importance (real-time telecom requirements) and some directions (co-design, edge), but again, without deep impact analysis or a structured research roadmap.\n\n- Earlier sections do identify gaps, but often briefly and without fully developed impact analysis:\n  - 1 Introduction: “Despite their advantages, LLMs also present notable challenges… computational overhead… domain adaptation…” and “cross-lingual transfer learning and multimodal integration hold promise [8].” These are valid gaps but discussed generically without detailed impact assessments.\n  - 2.1 Architectural Frameworks: “Computational demand… barrier… reducing model latency… integrating more efficient retrieval-augmented generation techniques.” This flags issues and directions, but the discussion does not analyze the specific telecom impacts (e.g., SLA violations, OPEX/CAPEX implications).\n  - 2.2 Operational Mechanics: “Challenges like computational overhead and scalability persist… window attention and sparse attention frameworks.” Identifies methods gaps but lacks deeper analysis of telecom-specific constraints (e.g., streaming packetized contexts, code-switching in operator commands).\n  - 2.3 Transfer Learning and Domain Adaptation: “Alignment of pre-trained knowledge… system biases… parameter-efficient techniques [5]… self-evolving methods [15].” This is one of the stronger gap identifications, connecting reasons (misalignment, bias) to impacts (performance degradation) and directions (PEFT, continual learning), though still mostly high-level.\n  - 2.4 Knowledge Graphs and IR Integration: “Careful calibration… trade-offs between computational overhead and performance gains… future directions… vector search.” It notes trade-offs and opportunities but lacks detailed problem framing (e.g., KG coverage, freshness, and telco-specific ontologies) and explicit impact pathways.\n  - 2.5 Ethics and Security: Provides a broad ethical/security agenda (bias mitigation, explainability, regulatory compliance) and points to future directions (RAG, knowledge graphs for ethics), but does not set out a prioritized telco-specific research plan.\n\n- Applications sections mention gaps, mostly as brief notes:\n  - 4.2 Network Management: “Substantial computational and energy overhead… data privacy concerns…” These are relevant but lightly analyzed in terms of operational impact.\n  - 4.3 Real-Time Communication Assistance: “Challenges persist, notably concerning latency and computational overhead…” Points to optimization strategies but not a detailed gap analysis for streaming inference in telecom-grade environments.\n  - 4.4 Security and Privacy Enhancement: “Adversarial attacks… adversarial training… blockchain synergy…” Valid concerns and directions, but impact analysis and feasibility trade-offs are not deeply explored.\n  - 4.5 Intelligent Scheduling: “Computational overhead… robust privacy frameworks…” Again, brief identification without deep impact analysis or research roadmap.\n\n- Evaluation and benchmarking sections touch future directions but do not frame them as explicit gaps:\n  - 7.1 Benchmarking: Mentions the need for telecom-specific benchmarks and dynamic environment adaptation. While appropriate, it does not analyze current benchmark shortcomings in detail or propose a comprehensive research agenda.\n  - 7.2 Custom Evaluation Metrics: Identifies the need for telecom-specific accuracy, latency, interoperability, and resource metrics. This is useful but lacks discussion of data availability for benchmarking, standardization, reproducibility, or comparability issues—key “data” dimension gaps.\n\nMissing or underdeveloped dimensions that reduce the score:\n- Data-centric gaps are not systematically or deeply addressed. There is little analysis of:\n  - Availability and quality of telecom-specific datasets (e.g., standards corpora, multilingual, code-switched logs, noisy telemetry text).\n  - Privacy-preserving data sharing/annotation and synthetic data generation tailored to telecom.\n  - Provenance, freshness, and curation of knowledge bases/graphs for telco operations.\n- A consolidated and prioritized Gap/Future Work section is absent. Gaps are scattered and not synthesized into a coherent research agenda with explicit impact pathways and dependencies.\n- Quantitative impact and prioritization are generally missing (e.g., how latency constraints translate to SLA breaches, or energy overhead to OPEX/CO2).\n- Safety/alignment gaps specific to telco operational actions (e.g., safe configuration changes, rollback policies, human-in-the-loop design) are not explicitly analyzed despite references to alignment surveys.\n\nIn sum, the paper does a commendable job identifying many relevant challenges and pointing to future directions across methods and systems, especially in Section 5. However, the analysis is often high-level, lacks a structured, comprehensive research gap synthesis, and is thin on data-centric issues and prioritized impact analysis, warranting a score of 3.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey identifies key real-world challenges in telecom (scalability, latency, computational overhead, legacy integration, privacy/security, evaluation gaps) and, in multiple sections, proposes forward-looking research directions that respond to these gaps. It also introduces several concrete suggestions (e.g., domain-tailored evaluation metrics, Telco-specific RAG, PEFT/quantization for sustainability, edge/IoT integration, unified protocols). However, many directions remain high-level; the analysis of academic/practical impact is often brief, and the paper rarely lays out detailed, actionable roadmaps or experimental designs. This aligns with a score of 4 rather than 5.\n\nEvidence supporting the score:\n- Clear gap-to-direction linkage on scalability and latency:\n  - Section 5.1 (Scalability): “Future prospects in LLM scalability require leveraging innovations such as distributed computing and edge processing… [and] hybrid model architectures that integrate retrieval-augmented generation” explicitly maps the identified scale/dynamism gap to distributed/edge processing and RAG-backed hybrids.\n  - Section 5.5 (Latency): Calls for “system and algorithm co-design,” “integrating edge computing,” and “advancing retrieval systems,” directly addressing real-time constraints with concrete avenues (PipeRAG co-design, edge offloading).\n- Resource/energy constraints to actionable techniques:\n  - Section 3.2 (Resource Management): Proposes “adaptive allocation frameworks utilizing real-time network analytics,” “model compression—pruning and quantization,” “mixed-precision training,” and “hardware acceleration (FPGAs)”—all practical strategies aligned with telecom cost, energy, and throughput needs.\n  - Section 6.4 (Sustainability): Suggests LoRA and “sparse fine-tuning and quantization” for energy/resource savings and advocates “domain-specific LLMs” to reduce training overhead—specific, implementable directions with high practical value.\n- Hallucination/factuality and domain grounding:\n  - Section 2.4 (Knowledge Graphs and IR/RAG): Goes beyond generic RAG by suggesting “deep integration techniques” and “knowledge embeddings tailored for telecommunications,” and “adaptively refine retrieval processes based on dynamic, evolving domain standards and metadata,” directly addressing the gap of factuality and domain currency in Telco contexts.\n  - Sections 4.3 and 5.5 reinforce RAG for real-time scenarios to balance accuracy and latency.\n- Legacy-system integration paths:\n  - Section 3.3 and Section 5.4: Recommend “API and middleware solutions,” “compatibility/abstraction layers,” and “progressive upgradation strategies,” plus future work on “enhancing interoperability frameworks” and modular architectures—practical, phased roadmaps that match real operator constraints.\n- Security/privacy gaps to research topics:\n  - Section 2.5 (Ethics/Security): Suggests “homomorphic encryption, secure multi-party computation, privacy-preserving ML,” and continuous monitoring/governance frameworks—direct responses to Telco data sensitivity and compliance regimes.\n  - Section 5.3: Calls for “advanced cryptographic techniques” and “decentralized model architectures,” tying model vulnerabilities to concrete security research directions.\n  - Section 4.4: Proposes synergy with “blockchain integration” for integrity and auditability, a cross-technology, domain-relevant direction.\n- Cross-technology integration and standardization:\n  - Section 4.6: Recommends “developing unified protocols and standards” across IoT, blockchain, AR/VR, and “academic and industry partnerships… with regulatory bodies,” which addresses a real operational barrier for multi-domain deployments.\n  - Section 6.2: Emphasizes edge deployment for latency, resource-constrained LLM design for IoT, and multi-modal capabilities—forward-looking and tied to Telco decentralization trends.\n- Evaluation and lifecycle gaps:\n  - Section 7.1: Calls for “more comprehensive benchmarking frameworks that integrate metrics for social and economic impacts,” not only technical KPIs—an innovative expansion aligned with operator decision-making.\n  - Section 7.2: Proposes concrete telecom-tailored metrics (e.g., “Telecom-Specific Accuracy Metric,” “Latency and real-time processing,” “Integration and Interoperability Scores,” “resource management efficiency”), offering actionable evaluation directions unique to telecom settings.\n  - Section 7.5: Advocates “adaptive performance monitoring,” “dynamic benchmarking,” and long-horizon “lifecycle impact assessments,” plus scalable evaluation frameworks—practical guidance on continuous model operations in live networks.\n\nWhy not a 5:\n- Many future directions are reiterated at a high level (edge computing, RAG, multimodality, blockchain, continual learning), with limited novel, telco-specific methodological detail or prioritized roadmaps.\n- The paper seldom articulates concrete research questions, experimental protocols, or datasets beyond general mentions (e.g., TeleQnA [25]) and does not deeply analyze academic vs. operational impact trade-offs (cost, reliability, compliance) for each proposed direction.\n- Some areas that could have been more actionable include:\n  - Detailed designs for Telco-RAG pipelines (e.g., domain-specific retrieval corpora curation, query routing policies across OSS/BSS/standards).\n  - Quantitative sustainability targets and evaluation schemes for PEFT/quantization under Telco SLAs.\n  - Specific interoperability standards or reference architectures for legacy integration and cross-technology stacks.\n\nOverall, the survey clearly surfaces key gaps and repeatedly links them to relevant, forward-looking proposals with practical resonance for telecom operations. It falls short of a 5 primarily due to limited depth on impact analysis and a lack of concrete, prioritized research agendas or methodologies."]}

{"name": "a1", "paperour": [3, 4, 3, 2, 3, 4, 4], "reason": ["3\n\nExplanation:\n\n- Research Objective Clarity:\n  - The title “Large Language Model (LLM) for Telecommunications: A Comprehensive Survey on Principles, Key Techniques, and Opportunities” implies a broad objective to survey foundations, methods, and telecom opportunities. However, the paper excerpt does not include a distinct Abstract or a clearly defined Introduction section that explicitly states the research questions, scope, or key contributions. As a result, the core objective remains inferred rather than explicitly articulated.\n  - Across early sections, the intent is implied rather than declared. For example:\n    - In 1.2 Transformer Architecture Fundamentals: “This architectural foundation directly sets the stage for the subsequent development of large language models… bridging the gap between architectural innovation and practical implementation in telecommunications and beyond.” This connects transformers to telecom applications but does not define the survey’s specific objectives or contributions.\n    - In 1.4 Computational Resource Considerations: “In the telecommunications domain, these computational considerations translate directly into infrastructure design, service delivery, and operational efficiency…” Again, the telecom relevance is clear, but the paper does not explicitly present an overarching objective or research direction at the outset.\n\n- Background and Motivation:\n  - The background is well-developed and detailed. Section 1.1 Historical Evolution of Language Models offers a thorough narrative from statistical models to transformers and LLMs, covering emergent capabilities, multilingual expansion, multimodality, efficiency, and ethics. This is a strong foundation that demonstrates the context for LLMs broadly.\n  - Motivation tied specifically to telecommunications is present but scattered and implicit, rather than set out in an Introduction. Examples include:\n    - 1.2 (closing): “bridging the gap… in telecommunications and beyond.”\n    - 1.4 (mid and closing): Highlights hardware, memory, energy, distributed training, and quantization with remarks like “In the telecommunications domain, these computational considerations translate directly…”\n  - What’s missing in the (non-existent) Abstract/Introduction is an explicit statement of why telecommunications uniquely needs this survey now (e.g., concrete telecom pain points, gaps in prior surveys, specific challenges like zero-touch operations or RAN optimization), and how the survey intends to address them.\n\n- Practical Significance and Guidance Value:\n  - The manuscript overall shows clear practical significance for telecom, but this emerges in later sections, not in an Abstract/Introduction. For instance:\n    - 1.5 Performance Evaluation Frameworks proposes telecom-relevant evaluation axes and references a telecom benchmark (TeleQnA in [40]), indicating practical evaluation guidance.\n    - 3 Practical Applications in Telecommunications (3.1–3.4) provides tangible use cases (network configuration automation, resource allocation, zero-touch operations, customer experience, predictive maintenance, security). These demonstrate strong practical guidance, but they are not summarized upfront.\n  - In the absence of an Abstract/Introduction, the reader is not given a concise roadmap of contributions or guidance value at the beginning. A standard survey introduction would typically enumerate contributions (e.g., taxonomy, benchmarks, open challenges, deployment strategies) and define the scope and audience.\n\nWhy the score is 3:\n- The research objective is present implicitly via the title and the structure of Section 1, but it is not explicitly articulated in an Abstract or Introduction. The background is thorough and well-explained (Section 1.1 and 1.2), yet the telecom-specific motivation and the survey’s guiding questions/contributions are not clearly introduced at the start. Practical significance is strong in later sections, but it is not framed upfront for the reader. Therefore, the clarity of objectives and motivation in the Abstract/Introduction (which are missing in the excerpt) is moderate rather than strong.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nOverall, the paper presents a relatively clear and reasonable method classification and a mostly coherent methodological evolution, but a few connections are occasionally inconsistent or underdeveloped for a perfect score.\n\nWhat works well:\n- Clear top-level taxonomy and logical flow from foundations to domain adaptation, to efficiency, to capabilities, ethics, and future directions:\n  - Section 1 (Foundations and Architectural Evolution) lays out a chronological and conceptual evolution: from statistical models to RNN/LSTM to Transformers and then to LLMs, with scaling, multilinguality, multimodality, and efficiency as emergent themes. For example, 1.1 explicitly narrates the historical trajectory (“Early language models were predominantly statistical… The introduction of neural network architectures… The transformative moment … arrived with the transformer architecture… Large Language Models (LLMs) emerged…”). Sections 1.2–1.3 then deepen the architecture and learning strategies (“The core innovation of the Transformer… self-attention” in 1.2; “self-supervised learning… scaling laws… domain-specific pre-training” in 1.3).\n  - Section 2 (Domain-Specific Adaptation Techniques) provides a method-centric taxonomy for telecom adaptation with four well-defined subcategories: 2.1 Knowledge Integration (ontological reasoning, knowledge graphs, semantic mapping), 2.2 Instruction Tuning and Data Generation (pipeline from corpus collection to template design to synthetic augmentation plus quality controls), 2.3 Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (LoRA, prompt tuning, selective updates), and 2.4 Cross-Domain Knowledge Transfer (multi-task learning, RAG, multimodality). Each subsection explicitly references its predecessors to show inheritance, e.g., “Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) naturally extends the instruction tuning methodologies” (2.3) and “Cross-domain knowledge transfer… building upon the parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques” (2.4).\n  - Section 4 (Computational Efficiency Strategies) is cleanly subdivided into 4.1 Model Compression (pruning/LaCo, distillation, tensorized representations), 4.2 Quantization (post-training quantization, differentiable quantization), and 4.3 Hardware-Aware Optimization (MoE, progressive subnetworks, cross-architectural optimization). The evolution within this block is explicit: “Quantization methodologies… building upon the model compression techniques” (4.2) and “Hardware-Aware Optimization… a critical extension of quantization methodologies” (4.3).\n  - Section 5 (Multilingual and Multimodal Capabilities) organizes capabilities rather than methods but still frames continuity (“Cross-lingual processing… extends…” in 5.1; “Multimodal integration represents a pivotal advancement… building upon the linguistic diversity explored in cross-lingual models” in 5.2), showing how language diversity and modality expansion fit into the broader LLM evolution.\n  - Section 1.5 (Performance Evaluation Frameworks) proposes a structured, multi-dimensional evaluation rubric tailored to telecom (Technical Performance, Domain-Specific, Ethical/Societal, Practical Utility) and situates it with benchmarks and methods (e.g., “synthetic tasks” in [37], multilingual evaluations in [39], domain-specific TeleQnA [40]).\n- Systematic “building upon” language across sections underscores inheritance and progression:\n  - 1.2 explicitly builds on 1.1; 1.3 builds on 1.2; 1.4 ties compute implications back to learning; 2.1–2.4 chain from instruction-tuned adaptation to PEFT to cross-domain transfer; 4.1–4.3 chain from pruning/distillation to quantization to hardware-aware deployment. These connective sentences make the evolutionary path explicit (e.g., “Quantization methodologies emerge… building upon the model compression techniques” in 4.2, and “Hardware-Aware Optimization… a critical extension of quantization methodologies” in 4.3).\n\nWhere it falls short of a perfect score:\n- Minor inconsistency in directional dependency between cross-lingual and multimodal capabilities:\n  - In 5.1, “Cross-lingual processing… extending the principles of multimodal integration to linguistic diversity” suggests multimodal precedes cross-lingual, while 5.2 states multimodal “builds upon the linguistic diversity explored in cross-lingual models.” These two subsections invert the dependency, creating a slight coherence issue in the evolution narrative between language diversity and modality expansion.\n- Some evolutionary stages are described more as parallel strands than as a timeline:\n  - For evaluation (1.5), the paper enumerates important strands (synthetic evaluation, qualitative evaluation, multilingual benchmarks, telecom-specific benchmarks, bias frameworks, user-centric evaluation) and proposes a holistic rubric, but does not map how evaluation methods have historically evolved or how each specifically emerged in response to earlier technological stages in LLM for telecom.\n- Occasional overlap and minor redundancy in efficiency classification:\n  - 4.1 (Model Compression Techniques) briefly folds quantization into compression (“Quantization techniques further enhance model compression…”), while 4.2 fully treats quantization as a separate category. While this mirrors common practice (quantization as part of compression), it dilutes crisp boundaries between categories within this section.\n- Telecom-specific method taxonomy could be further tightened:\n  - Section 2 is strong in method classification for domain adaptation, but the crosswalk from these methods to telecom-specific pipelines (e.g., mapping 2.1–2.4 to concrete telecom tasks in 3.1–3.4) is mostly verbal and could be made more systematic. The paper does connect adaptation methods to applications (e.g., 2.3 notes telecom tasks such as network configuration interpretation and documentation analysis), but a more explicit taxonomy linking method families to telecom use-cases would enhance clarity.\n\nBottom line:\n- Method classification is relatively clear and mostly well-structured, with solid subcategories and explicit inter-section references that reflect a coherent development path from foundation to adaptation to efficiency.\n- The evolution is largely systematic, especially in Sections 1, 2, and 4, but contains a few minor inconsistencies (5.1 vs. 5.2 dependency) and areas where historical progression is implied rather than explicitly charted (evaluation frameworks).\n- Therefore, a score of 4 accurately reflects a strong but not flawless classification-evolution coherence.", "Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey provides some breadth on evaluation frameworks but gives limited, high-level coverage of concrete datasets and metrics, and lacks detail on dataset characteristics and labeling procedures.\n\nEvidence supporting the score:\n- Section 1.5 Performance Evaluation Frameworks is the main locus for datasets/metrics coverage. It cites and briefly characterizes several benchmarks/frameworks:\n  - “[39] MEGA” is described as “a comprehensive benchmarking approach covering 16 NLP datasets across 70 typologically diverse languages.” This indicates scope and linguistic coverage but does not detail dataset composition, task types, labeling processes, or per-dataset characteristics.\n  - “[40] TeleQnA” is introduced as “a specialized benchmark dataset… a dataset of 10,000 questions drawn from standards and research articles.” This provides a numeric scale and domain source but does not explain application scenarios (e.g., QA formats, task taxonomy, standards coverage), labeling methodology (e.g., curation, answer sourcing/validation, inter-annotator agreement), or splits.\n  - “[37] S3Eval” is characterized as “using synthetic tasks to systematically probe model capabilities,” and “[38] QualEval” as a “qualitative assessment technique.” Both are relevant, but the survey does not detail task types, data generation protocols, or how these methods map to telecom tasks.\n  - “[41] GPTBIAS” is said to provide “bias scores… and detailed insights into bias types,” and “[42] User-centric benchmark” covers real-world use cases from 712 participants. Again, no specifics on metrics, sampling, labeling, or how these apply to telecom contexts.\n- The same section enumerates four high-level evaluation dimensions (Technical Performance Metrics, Domain-Specific Evaluation, Ethical and Societal Considerations, Practical Utility Metrics) and lists generic items such as “computational efficiency,” “model accuracy,” “generalization capabilities,” “multilingual proficiency,” “bias detection,” “fairness,” “user experience,” etc. However, it does not instantiate these with concrete, field-standard metrics (e.g., perplexity, exact match/F1 for QA, BLEU/COMET for translation, ROUGE for summarization, energy per token, latency/throughput/Joules-per-token, ROC-AUC/PR-AUC/FPR for anomaly detection, MAPE/MAE/RMSE for time-series, fairness parity/EO metrics, or factuality/hallucination measures).\n- Beyond Section 1.5, the applications sections (3.1–3.4) do not anchor their claims to datasets or concrete evaluation protocols. For instance:\n  - 3.1 Network Infrastructure Management discusses configuration automation, resource allocation, and zero-touch management, but provides no datasets (e.g., public NetFlow/PCAP traces, traffic matrices, or configuration corpora) or metrics (e.g., configuration exact-match accuracy, change failure rate, SLA violation rates, remediation latency).\n  - 3.3 Predictive Maintenance and Monitoring references potential operational benefits (“reduce equipment downtime by up to 30–50%”) but does not tie these to specific datasets or evaluation metrics (e.g., time-to-failure prediction AUC, forecast MAE/MAPE on telecom telemetry, benchmark datasets).\n  - 3.4 Security and Anomaly Detection highlights capability but omits common public datasets (e.g., CIC-IDS2017, UNSW-NB15, MAWI) and standard metrics (precision/recall/F1, ROC-AUC, detection latency, false positive rate).\n- Earlier sections reference evaluation-related works (e.g., [36] “A Survey on Evaluation of LLMs”), but the survey does not consolidate concrete metric definitions or telecom-specific task metrics. Likewise, energy and efficiency are discussed in 1.4 (e.g., [30] on energy costs), yet 1.5 does not translate that into explicit measurement protocols or metrics for evaluation.\n- There is no dedicated Data section cataloging telecom-relevant datasets across subdomains (network telemetry/traffic, security, customer service, RAN logs, speech/multilingual corpora), nor are labeling methods, splits, or data quality issues discussed.\n\nWhy this aligns with a “3”:\n- The survey does cover a limited but diverse set of evaluation artifacts (synthetic probes, qualitative evaluation, multilingual benchmarks, domain-specific TeleQnA, bias and user-centric evaluations), which is stronger than minimal coverage. However:\n  - Descriptions are brief and lack detail about dataset scale beyond MEGA and TeleQnA, labeling schemes, task taxonomies, and usage scenarios.\n  - The metrics discussion remains general; it does not enumerate or justify concrete, field-standard metrics aligned to the telecom tasks described.\n  - Core telecom sub-areas lack dataset and metric anchoring (time-series forecasting for traffic, anomaly detection, configuration QA, customer service dialog evaluation, multilingual speech/translation), limiting practical applicability.\n\nSuggestions to strengthen coverage (for future revisions):\n- Expand dataset coverage with telecom-relevant public corpora and describe scale, tasks, and labeling:\n  - Network traffic/telemetry: CAIDA/MAWI traces, Abilene/GEANT traffic matrices, UGR’16; security: CIC-IDS2017/2018, UNSW-NB15, CSE-CIC-IDS2018; time-series: ETT, M4/M5 (for forecasting baselines); configuration/code: network config corpora or synthetic config QA; customer support: MultiWOZ/Taskmaster-style dialog baselines if telecom-specific corpora are not public; multilingual/speech: WMT, FLORES-200, MuST-C, CoVoST, LibriSpeech.\n- Specify and justify metrics per task family:\n  - Language tasks: perplexity, EM/F1 (QA), ROUGE/BERTScore (summarization), BLEU/chrF++/COMET (translation).\n  - Telecom tasks: config synthesis exact-match/semantic accuracy; anomaly detection precision/recall/F1, ROC-AUC/PR-AUC, detection latency/FPR; forecasting MAE/MAPE/RMSE/sMAPE; resource allocation/SLA metrics (SLA violation rate, throughput, latency, jitter); customer support resolution rate/first-contact resolution/CSAT; energy/efficiency (tokens/sec, latency p50/p95, Joules/token, memory footprint).\n  - Ethics/safety: bias (e.g., StereoSet, CrowS-Pairs), fairness (demographic parity/equalized odds), privacy (membership-inference attack success rate), factuality/hallucination (FactScore-style or human eval), LLM-as-a-judge caveats and human-in-the-loop protocols.\n- Provide brief dataset summaries: size, domains, splits, annotation procedures, known biases, and telecom-specific relevance.\n\nOverall, the current treatment introduces useful evaluation directions and cites a handful of relevant benchmarks, but lacks sufficient dataset depth and concrete metricization to merit a higher score.", "Score: 2\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey largely describes families of methods and enumerates related techniques, but it rarely offers a systematic, side-by-side comparison across clear dimensions (e.g., architectural assumptions, data dependence, learning objectives, efficiency, and applicability). Advantages and disadvantages are mentioned only intermittently and not contrasted explicitly between methods, and commonalities/distinctions are generally implied rather than analyzed.\n\nEvidence from specific sections:\n- Section 1.2 Transformer Architecture Fundamentals:\n  - The text lists alternatives and refinements (“some studies have investigated the potential of replacing traditional self-attention with more efficient mechanisms like Fourier transforms [14] or examining the relative importance of different attention components [15]”; “sparse attention [17], tensor decomposition [18], and adaptive attention mechanisms”), but does not compare them across dimensions (e.g., complexity, accuracy, scalability, data regimes) or articulate pros/cons in a structured way. It remains descriptive rather than comparative.\n\n- Section 1.3 Pre-training and Learning Strategies:\n  - The section mentions diverse strategies (“self-supervised learning techniques… [19], knowledge graph integration [22], domain-specific pre-training [23], mixture-of-experts [26]”), yet there is no systematic contrast of objectives, assumptions, or trade-offs (e.g., how KG integration affects downstream generalization vs. MoE’s efficiency profile). Advantages/disadvantages are not laid out explicitly.\n\n- Section 1.5 Performance Evaluation Frameworks:\n  - The survey lists frameworks and benchmarks ([36]–[42]) and proposes a high-level multi-dimensional evaluation schema at the end, but it does not compare the referenced frameworks against each other (e.g., synthetic task probing [37] vs. qualitative evaluation [38] vs. multilingual benchmarking [39] vs. domain-specific TeleQnA [40]) in terms of coverage, validity, reliability, or practical limitations. This remains a catalog rather than a structured comparison.\n\n- Section 2.1 Knowledge Integration Methods:\n  - There is an implicit contrast between “Ontological Reasoning Approaches” and “Targeted Information Injection,” with sub-strategies listed (semantic mapping, KG embedding, hierarchical representations vs. fine-tuning with domain corpora, prompt engineering, hybrid knowledge fusion). However, the section does not explicitly compare these approaches on data requirements, interpretability, maintenance cost, adaptability, or error modes; nor does it enumerate pros/cons per approach. The “Computational Considerations” paragraph cites a general balancing act (“balance the depth of knowledge injection with model efficiency [46]”) but does not translate this into concrete comparative trade-offs.\n\n- Section 2.2 Instruction Tuning and Data Generation:\n  - The section details a pipeline (corpus collection, template engineering, synthetic augmentation) and quality dimensions (semantic coherence, diversity, technical precision), and mentions optimization techniques (multi-task learning [49], knowledge distillation [48], adaptive LR scheduling). It does not compare alternative instruction-tuning paradigms (e.g., supervised instruction datasets vs. synthetic augmentation strategies) with respect to robustness, data noise tolerance, or domain transferability.\n\n- Section 2.3 Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning:\n  - It introduces variants (LoRA [50], prompt tuning [52], selective parameter updating [53]) and claims “performance comparable to full fine-tuning” [54], but does not provide a structured comparison of the PEFT methods themselves (e.g., their assumptions, parameter budgets, stability, inference overhead, or suitability by task type). The relationships among methods remain unelaborated.\n\n- Section 2.4 Cross-Domain Knowledge Transfer:\n  - This section enumerates methods (multi-task learning [55], foundation models [56], RAG [57], PEFT [58], targeted skill development [59], multimodality [56]) without contrasting their objectives, data dependencies, or deployment constraints in a systematic way.\n\n- Section 4.1 Model Compression Techniques:\n  - While it highlights LaCo [8] and cites an empirical result (“average task performance of over 80% at pruning ratios of 25–30%”), it does not contrast LaCo with other pruning strategies (“structured pruning [53]”) across multiple dimensions or discuss where LaCo underperforms. Distillation and TTM [74] are mentioned, but not compared head-to-head on accuracy, memory footprint, or ease of integration.\n\n- Section 4.2 Quantization Methodologies:\n  - The section distinguishes post-training quantization vs. differentiable quantization and references performance claims (“reduce model size by up to 50–75% while maintaining over 99% of original performance [68]”), yet it does not compare these quantization approaches across task types, hardware targets, or failure cases; nor does it articulate pros/cons and assumptions explicitly.\n\n- Sections 6.1–6.3 Ethical Considerations:\n  - Bias, privacy, and explainability sections list techniques (e.g., probing, data curation, controlled generation [45], differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, federated learning) but do not compare methods systematically (e.g., their guarantees, utility trade-offs, implementation complexity), and rarely tie methods together through explicit commonalities/distinctions.\n\nOverall, the survey demonstrates breadth and coverage but lacks a systematic, technically grounded comparative framework. It primarily catalogs methods and directions, with few explicit, structured contrasts of architectures/objectives/assumptions and limited articulation of advantages/disadvantages per method. Hence, it aligns with the “lists characteristics/outcomes with limited explicit comparison” criterion, warranting a score of 2.", "Score: 3/5\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey provides broad coverage and occasional evaluative remarks, but its critical analysis of methods is generally shallow and uneven. It mostly catalogs techniques and trends without consistently explaining underlying mechanisms, design trade-offs, or fundamental causes for performance differences. Where relationships are synthesized, they are often rhetorical (“builds upon,” “complements”) rather than technically grounded analyses of why or when one method outperforms another.\n\nEvidence by section:\n\n- 1.2 Transformer Architecture Fundamentals: The section explains what self-attention, multi-head attention, and positional encodings do (“The core innovation of the Transformer architecture is the self-attention mechanism…dramatically improving computational efficiency.”), but it does not analyze trade-offs (e.g., O(n^2) complexity vs. linear variants), failure modes, or why alternatives (e.g., Fourier-based layers [14], sparse attention [17]) succeed or fail in specific regimes. The mentions of “replacing traditional self-attention with more efficient mechanisms like Fourier transforms [14]” and “wide versus deep Transformer models [16]” are descriptive; they lack mechanistic explanations or conditions under which these choices are preferable.\n\n- 1.3 Pre-training and Learning Strategies: The narrative links scaling laws [21], multilingual strategies [25], and MoE [26], but does not probe assumptions and limitations (e.g., data contamination, memorization vs. generalization, instability in MoE routing, catastrophic forgetting in continual pretraining). Phrases like “Scaling laws provide a quantitative framework…” and “Pre-training objectives have diversified…” remain high-level and do not unpack fundamental causes for observed differences among objectives or data curation strategies.\n\n- 1.4 Computational Resource Considerations: The section enumerates GPUs, memory, energy, distributed training, quantization, edge deployment (“Techniques like model sharding, ZeRO optimization, and distributed computing…”; “INT4 weight-only quantization [32]…”), but omits analysis of trade-offs such as communication overhead vs. throughput in distributed strategies, latency implications for telco workloads, activation vs. weight-only quantization challenges, or edge deployment trade-offs (e.g., accuracy loss vs. tighter SLAs).\n\n- 1.5 Performance Evaluation Frameworks: This section lists evaluation directions—synthetic probes [37], qualitative methods [38], multilingual benchmarks [39], telecom-specific datasets [40], bias frameworks [41], user-centric perspectives [42]—and proposes a four-part taxonomy. It does not analyze foundational pitfalls (e.g., contamination, evaluator bias, prompt sensitivity) or dissect why specific evaluation designs reveal different failure modes. It also lacks discussion of trade-offs between task-general vs. domain-specific evaluation or the reliability limits of synthetic tasks.\n\n- 2.1 Knowledge Integration Methods: Offers a structured overview (semantic mapping, knowledge graph embeddings, hierarchical representation; fine-tuning, prompt engineering, hybrid fusion) and lists “Challenges and Limitations” (“Maintaining model generalizability…Ensuring consistent and accurate representation…”). However, it does not explore root causes (e.g., ontology mismatch and concept drift, spurious correlations in fused sources), or analyze how different injection methods affect internal representations, forgetting, and inference-time robustness.\n\n- 2.2 Instruction Tuning and Data Generation: Provides process-level detail (template engineering, synthetic augmentation, quality metrics) but avoids core trade-offs (e.g., synthetic data drift/hallucination vs. diversity gains, prompt distribution mismatch, brittleness to instruction phrasing). Statements like “Quality assessment mechanisms…Semantic Coherence…Diversity and Representativeness…Technical Precision” are criteria lists without interpretive analysis or empirical assumptions.\n\n- 2.3 Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT): Describes LoRA, prompt tuning, selective updating, and claims of efficiency (“Empirical studies validate the effectiveness…while requiring significantly fewer computational resources [54]”) without discussing limitations (e.g., capacity bottlenecks with low-rank adapters, cross-task interference, task compositionality, sensitivity to base model pretraining). There is no discussion of when PEFT underperforms full fine-tuning or why.\n\n- 2.4 Cross-Domain Knowledge Transfer: Enumerates multi-task learning, foundation models, RAG, PEFT, targeted skill development, multimodal learning; mentions resource constraints. It does not examine negative transfer risks, retrieval precision/latency trade-offs in RAG, or domain boundary conditions that govern transfer success.\n\n- 4.1–4.3 Computational Efficiency (Model Compression, Quantization, Hardware-Aware Optimization): These sections list techniques (LaCo pruning [8], distillation, TTM [74], INT4 [32], MoE [26], progressive subnetwork training [78]) and headline outcomes (“preserve an average task performance of over 80% at pruning ratios of 25-30%”; “reduce model size by up to 50-75% while maintaining over 99% of original performance”). They do not interrogate fundamental causes of performance loss under different compression/quantization schemes (e.g., outlier channels, per-channel vs. per-tensor quantization, activation vs. weight-only quantization), nor do they analyze inference/hardware trade-offs (e.g., memory bandwidth vs. compute-bound regimes, kernel support, operator fragmentation).\n\n- 5.1 Cross-Lingual Processing and 5.2 Multimodal Integration: These sections repeatedly draw parallels (“parallels the cross-linguistic knowledge transfer strategies…”) and identify themes (shared semantic spaces, zero-shot transfer, bias toward high-resource languages). However, they lack mechanism-level discussion (e.g., subword vocabulary dominance, alignment strategies like shared tokens vs. language adapters, negative transfer dynamics) or precise design trade-offs in multimodal fusion (early vs. late fusion, attention routing, modality imbalance).\n\n- 6.1–6.3 Ethics (Bias, Privacy, Transparency): The paper acknowledges concerns and lists mitigation ideas (controlled generation, prompt engineering, differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, federated learning, modular architectures, reasoning traces). It stops short of analyzing causal pathways for bias (e.g., data imbalance, spurious attribute co-occurrence), formal privacy-utility trade-offs (ε-DP vs. performance), or explainability tensions (faithfulness vs. plausibility). The commentary is sensible but generic.\n\nOverall, while the survey is comprehensive and occasionally synthesizes relationships (“This approach builds upon…”, “complements…”, “sets the stage for…”), it largely reports methods and trends rather than deeply explaining why methods differ, when each method is preferable, or what assumptions drive limitations. The absence of consistent mechanism-level reasoning, trade-off analyses, and failure mode discussions places it at a solid 3/5 for critical analysis.", "Score: 4/5\n\nExplanation:\nThe paper identifies a broad set of research gaps across multiple dimensions (data, methods, systems, and ethics) and offers future work directions, but much of the discussion remains high-level and dispersed, with limited deep analysis of why each gap matters to telecommunications or how it concretely affects progress. The work is strong in coverage but lighter in depth, impact analysis, and systematic synthesis.\n\nWhere the paper clearly identifies gaps:\n- Data and domain knowledge integration:\n  - Section 2.1 (Knowledge Integration Methods), “Challenges and Limitations” explicitly lists gaps such as “Maintaining model generalizability while introducing specialized knowledge,” “Managing computational complexity of knowledge injection techniques,” and the need for “robust evaluation frameworks for domain-specific model performance.” This is a well-scoped identification of problems in data/knowledge integration for telecoms, though the downstream impact is not deeply elaborated.\n- Evaluation and benchmarking:\n  - Section 1.5 (Performance Evaluation Frameworks) notes “Traditional evaluation metrics have proven insufficient,” and calls for comprehensive, domain-specific assessments (multilingual, ethical, user-centric), supported by examples like TeleQnA [40]. This flags a clear gap in evaluation methodologies and domain benchmarks, which is important for telecom contexts.\n- Computational resource constraints:\n  - Section 1.4 (Computational Resource Considerations) repeatedly identifies gaps: “Memory management emerges as a critical challenge… techniques like model sharding, ZeRO,” “Energy consumption represents another crucial aspect,” and issues with “edge computing and mobile deployment.” These are material gaps for telecom deployments (e.g., BSPs, edge sites), although the impact is described qualitatively.\n- Methods and efficiency:\n  - Section 4.1 (Model Compression): “Challenges persist in maintaining model performance while reducing computational complexity.” \n  - Section 4.2 (Quantization): “Challenges persist in developing universally applicable quantization methodologies.” \n  - Section 4.3 (Hardware-Aware Optimization): positions MoE, pruning, and data-centric optimization as needed directions, but is light on concrete, telecom-specific design trade-offs.\n- Application-specific challenges:\n  - Section 3.1 (Network Infrastructure Management), “Challenges and Considerations”: “ensuring model interpretability, managing computational complexity, maintaining robust security protocols, and developing precise domain-specific training methodologies.” This correctly surfaces critical operational gaps for closed-loop or semi-autonomous network operations.\n  - Section 3.3 (Predictive Maintenance): “challenges remain in… data quality, managing computational complexity, and developing robust validation frameworks,” and calls for “specialized LLM architectures… for telecommunications infrastructure monitoring.”\n  - Section 3.4 (Security and Anomaly Detection): notes “computational complexity and resource requirements,” “bias and false positives,” and the need for “rigorous testing, continuous model refinement, and human oversight,” as well as the opportunity/need for edge-based approaches.\n- Multilingual/multimodal capability gaps:\n  - Section 5.1 (Cross-Lingual Processing): “Current multilingual LLMs are not without limitations… subtle preference towards high-resource languages,” and cross-lingual performance variability—an important data/methods gap with direct telecom relevance for global operators.\n  - Section 5.2 (Multimodal Integration): identifies “computational efficiency” constraints (quadratic attention) as a barrier to scalable, real-time multimodal telecom applications.\n- Ethics, privacy, and explainability:\n  - Section 6.1 (Bias): documents systemic bias risks and the need for “continuous monitoring and dynamic adaptation.” It also highlights cross-lingual/cultural bias (models pivoting on English).\n  - Section 6.2 (Privacy): enumerates concrete attack vectors (membership inference, inversion), and gaps requiring “federated learning,” “homomorphic encryption,” and “robust adversarial defense mechanisms.”\n  - Section 6.3 (Transparency and Explainability): identifies the “opaque” nature of LLMs as a deployment barrier and proposes high-level strategies (modular architectures, probabilistic reasoning traces), indicating a gap in operational explainability tooling for telecom.\n\nWhy this is not a 5/5:\n- The gap analysis is more enumerative than diagnostic. Many sections identify “what” is missing but do not delve into “why it matters specifically for telecom” or quantify impact. For example:\n  - Section 4.* (efficiency) mentions challenges but does not connect them to real-time SLA constraints, latency budgets, or cost/energy trade-offs typical in carrier networks.\n  - Section 1.5 (evaluation) calls for sophisticated frameworks but does not articulate how evaluation shortcomings concretely lead to deployment failures (e.g., hallucination risks in closed-loop network config, safety cases for zero-touch).\n- Limited integration across dimensions. The review does not synthesize gaps into a cohesive taxonomy (e.g., data availability/quality/labeling; methods robustness/calibration/interpretability; systems integration/latency/hardening; governance/compliance/monitoring), nor does it map which gaps block which use-cases (e.g., autonomous configuration vs. customer support vs. security).\n- Impact analysis is brief. While sections like 3.3 allude to benefits (e.g., reduced downtime), the consequences of unresolved gaps are seldom analyzed in depth—such as the operational risk of LLM hallucinations in NOC automation, auditing requirements for 3GPP/ETSI-aligned workflows, or failure modes under distribution shift.\n- Future Research Directions (Section 7.1–7.3) are aspirational and opportunity-oriented rather than gap-driven. They present visionary directions (AI-native architectures, advanced communication paradigms, interdisciplinary work) but do not rigorously connect to the specific shortcomings identified earlier, nor prioritize gaps by urgency or impact.\n- Missing or underdeveloped gap areas important for telecom:\n  - Standardization and interoperability (e.g., alignment with 3GPP/ETSI standards, MLOps compliance in carrier environments).\n  - Safety and governance for closed-loop control (e.g., guardrailing, verification, calibration, fail-safe mechanisms).\n  - Data governance specifics (PII handling in call logs, lawful intercept constraints, retention policies, synthetic data for privacy-preserving fine-tuning).\n  - Robustness and reliability (distribution shift, adversarial robustness in live networks).\n  - Reproducibility and benchmarking across operators and vendors beyond the single TeleQnA mention.\n\nOverall judgment:\n- The paper earns 4/5 because it identifies many relevant research gaps across data, methods, systems, and ethics and ties them to future work at a high level. However, it falls short of a “comprehensive and deeply analyzed” gap treatment: the discussion often lacks depth on why each gap is critical in telecom contexts and how it concretely impacts deployment, risk, and progress. A more systematic taxonomy, explicit impact analysis, and prioritization would elevate this to a 5/5.", "4\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey proposes several forward-looking research directions that are clearly aligned with real-world telecommunications needs, but the analysis of the underlying gaps and the actionable path to address them is often high-level and lacks depth.\n\nEvidence of forward-looking directions aligned with real-world gaps:\n- Section 1.4 Computational Resource Considerations explicitly identifies a core real-world gap (cost, energy, memory, and deployment constraints) and calls for future work: “Future research must continue to focus on developing more computationally efficient model architectures, creating specialized hardware accelerators, and designing intelligent resource allocation strategies.” This sets up concrete directions addressing pressing operational constraints in telecom environments.\n- Section 1.5 Performance Evaluation Frameworks argues the inadequacy of traditional metrics in telecom and suggests multi-dimensional evaluation needs: “Performance evaluation frameworks must evolve to provide comprehensive, nuanced assessments that bridge computational capabilities with practical telecommunications requirements.” This aligns with real-world needs for reliability, multilinguality, and domain knowledge, and motivates future work on domain-specific benchmarks (supported by the earlier introduction of TeleQnA in [40]).\n- Section 2.1 Knowledge Integration Methods lists specific emerging directions tied to domain gaps in telecom knowledge representation: “Multi-Modal Knowledge Representation,” “Dynamic Knowledge Adaptation,” and “Cross-Domain Knowledge Transfer.” These topics directly respond to the challenge of integrating complex, evolving telecom knowledge sources.\n- Section 3.1 Network Infrastructure Management provides a concrete bulleted list under “Future Research Directions,” including “Development of specialized telecommunications domain LLMs,” “Enhanced explainable AI techniques for network management,” “Integration of multimodal data processing capabilities,” and “Advanced few-shot and zero-shot learning methodologies.” These are specific and actionable directions that map well to real-world operations such as configuration automation and zero-touch management.\n- Section 6.2 Privacy and Data Protection presents future-oriented, practical safeguards for telecom data, e.g., “The future of privacy in telecommunications LLMs will likely involve hybrid approaches that combine multiple protection strategies,” and enumerates differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, federated learning, anonymization, and adversarial defenses—all directly responsive to regulatory and operational needs.\n- Section 6.3 Transparency and Explainability offers concrete techniques and tools tied to deployment trustworthiness: “Modular Architectures,” “Probabilistic Reasoning Traces,” “Interactive Explanation Interfaces,” and “Ethical Knowledge Graphs,” again reflecting real-world telecom demands for audited, explainable decision-making in sensitive contexts.\n\nEvidence of breadth and innovation:\n- Section 7.1 Emerging Network Intelligence Technologies is forward-looking in scope, proposing “AI-native network architectures,” “zero-touch network management,” “predictive maintenance,” “LLM-powered security,” and even “emergent autonomous scientific discovery.” These are innovative and ambitious directions that address central telecom challenges (autonomy, resilience, threat response).\n- Section 7.2 Advanced Communication Paradigms highlights “cross-lingual” and “multimodal” communication, and points to “adaptive communication models that can dynamically adjust their processing based on contextual requirements,” recognizing real-world multilingual CX and multimodal operation scenarios.\n- Section 7.3 Interdisciplinary Research Opportunities enumerates wide-ranging collaborations—computational neuroscience, ethics, quantum computing, neurolinguistics, bio-inspired computing—opening novel research topics beyond conventional telecom/ML silos.\n\nWhy this is not a 5:\n- The link between identified gaps and proposed directions is frequently implicit rather than explicitly analyzed. For example, in Section 7.1 and 7.2, the vision for “AI-native architectures,” “adaptive communication models,” and “multimodal integration” is compelling but lacks concrete research questions, methodological roadmaps, or evaluation strategies. There is little discussion of “causes” of the gaps or detailed “impacts,” beyond high-level statements like “computational efficiency remains a critical consideration” or “bias mitigation and semantic preservation” are challenges.\n- Several directions are broad and aspirational. Section 7.3’s list (e.g., “quantum computing,” “bio-inspired computing”) is innovative but not tied to specific telecom problem statements or actionable experiments, datasets, or benchmarks. Similarly, Section 7.2 acknowledges challenges—“computational efficiency, bias mitigation, and semantic preservation”—but does not lay out concrete steps to address them within telecom contexts.\n- Even where specific directions are offered (e.g., Section 3.1’s bullets, Section 6.3’s tools), the paper rarely provides a thorough analysis of their academic and practical impact or a clear implementation path (e.g., data requirements, system integration constraints, measurement plans), which the 5-point criterion requires.\n\nSummary:\nThe paper earns 4 points because it consistently identifies forward-looking research directions rooted in real-world telecom needs (efficiency, privacy, explainability, multilingual/multimodal communication, zero-touch operations) and proposes multiple new topics and suggestions. However, the analysis of the causes of gaps and the actionable paths to address them is often brief and high-level, and the academic/practical impact is not explored in sufficient depth to merit the highest score."]}

Practical significance and guidance value are also explicitly addressed. However, the absence of an Abstract in the provided material and minor structural redundancies prevent a full-score assessment.\n\n- Research Objective Clarity:\n  - The survey’s objectives are explicitly and comprehensively stated in Section 1.6 (Scope and Objectives of the Survey). The “Objectives of the Survey” subsection lists five clear aims:\n    - “Consolidating Interdisciplinary Research” (Section 1.6) — clarifies the intent to bridge foundational work (Transformers, PEFT) with telecom deployments.\n    - “Identifying Challenges and Opportunities” (Section 1.6) — commits to critically evaluating barriers such as computational costs, hallucinations, environmental impacts, and privacy, while highlighting opportunities like federated learning.\n    - “Frameworks for Responsible Deployment” (Section 1.6) — signals actionable guidance for ethical integration drawing from healthcare and legal domains.\n    - “Benchmarking and Performance Evaluation” (Section 1.6) — defines criteria tailored to telecom, emphasizing fairness, latency, and domain adaptation.\n    - “Future Research Directions” (Section 1.6) — sets a forward-looking agenda on datasets and human oversight.\n  - The “Rationale for Scope and Objectives” subsection (Section 1.6) further strengthens clarity by explaining why the survey balances technical and ethical dimensions and prioritizes practical relevance (e.g., RAG, edge deployment).\n  - Minor issues:\n    - The absence of an Abstract in the provided text reduces top-level clarity and quick accessibility of the paper’s central objective and contributions.\n    - A duplicated heading “### 1.2 Core Principles and Architectures of LLMs” (appearing twice) slightly detracts from structural clarity.\n\n- Background and Motivation:\n  - The background is rich and logically developed in Section 1.1 (Evolution and Background of Large Language Models), which traces the field from statistical models through RNN/LSTM to Transformers, scaling laws, efficiency optimizations (LoRA/QLoRA, BitNet b1.58), and multimodal expansion. This connects directly to telecom relevance (e.g., real-time signal processing, network logs, customer interactions).\n  - Section 1.2 (Core Principles and Architectures of LLMs) grounds the technical foundation (encoder/decoder, attention mechanisms, positional encodings, training paradigms, emerging architectures like Mamba, Energy Transformer, Zebra) and ties these explicitly to telecom needs (long sequences, resource constraints, real-time processing).\n  - Section 1.5 (Motivations for LLM Adoption in Telecom) clearly articulates drivers:\n    - Operational efficiency and automation via RAG and few-shot adaptation.\n    - Cost optimization through caching and smaller local models.\n    - Personalized user experiences and multilingual support.\n    - Regulatory compliance and future-readiness.\n  - Section 1.3 (Transformative Potential) and Section 1.4 (Challenges) together situate both the promise and the barriers (latency, privacy, domain adaptation, bias/fairness, scalability), strengthening motivation and credibility of the survey’s need.\n\n- Practical Significance and Guidance Value:\n  - The survey demonstrates practical guidance value throughout the Introduction:\n    - Section 1.3 connects architectural capabilities to concrete telecom use cases (Zero-Touch Network and Service Management, customer service automation with frameworks like “Sahaay,” phishing detection and security logs analysis).\n    - Section 1.4 enumerates adoption challenges with mitigation strategies (quantization, compression, federated learning, XAI, HITL, scalability and dynamic adaptation), showing actionable pathways rather than purely descriptive hurdles.\n    - Section 1.6 operationalizes the survey’s value via specific objectives that will guide the rest of the paper (benchmarks, ethics frameworks, edge deployment strategies, multimodal fusion), making it useful to researchers, practitioners, and policymakers.\n  - The “Rationale for Scope and Objectives” (Section 1.6) highlights balanced coverage (technical plus societal), immediate operator value (RAG, edge deployment), and cross-domain ethical insights—indicating clear industry guidance.\n\nWhy not 5:\n- The provided content lacks an Abstract, which is typically crucial for immediate clarity of objectives, contributions, and scope. Given the task focuses on evaluating the Abstract and Introduction, the absence of an Abstract modestly diminishes top-level clarity and accessibility.\n- Minor structural redundancy (duplicate heading in Section 1.2) and the placement of objectives (Section 1.6 appears after multiple subsections) could be improved by presenting a concise, early statement of purpose and contributions at the outset of the Introduction.\n\nIn sum, the Introduction presents clear, specific objectives; a thorough, well-connected background and motivation; and strong practical guidance. With a succinct Abstract and minor structural refinements, this would merit a full score.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey presents a relatively clear and coherent method classification and a reasonably systematic evolution of methodology, with strong cross-referencing between sections and a logical progression from foundational principles to integration techniques and applications. However, a few inconsistencies and minor gaps prevent a perfect score.\n\nStrengths supporting the score:\n- Clear evolutionary narrative in Section 1.1:\n  - “Early Foundations: Statistical Language Models to Neural Networks” → “The Transformer Revolution and Foundational Models” → “Scaling Laws and Emergent Capabilities” → “Efficiency Optimizations and Specialized Architectures” → “Multimodal Expansion and Domain Adaptation” → “Current Challenges and Future Integration.”\n  - This sequence explicitly traces the field’s development path, connecting architectural changes (RNN/LSTM → Transformer) to scale-driven capabilities (few-shot/zero-shot) and then to efficiency and domain adaptation relevant to telecom.\n- Well-structured method classification that builds from foundations to applied techniques:\n  - Section 2 offers a layered technical taxonomy:\n    - 2.1 “Core Architectures of LLMs” (Transformer components, attention, positional encodings, FFNs, variants)\n    - 2.2 “Training Paradigms for LLMs” (pre-training, fine-tuning, PEFT, hybrid approaches)\n    - 2.3 “Key Capabilities of LLMs” (in-context learning, multilingual processing, zero-/few-shot)\n    - 2.4 “Parameter Efficiency and Scalability” (compression, PEFT, federated learning, edge-cloud)\n    - 2.5 “Domain-Specific Adaptation” (domain-adaptive pre-training, prompt engineering)\n    - 2.6 “Emerging Architectural Innovations” (Mamba, hybrid energy/attention, sparse/local-global attention)\n  - This classification is clear, comprehensive, and matches the technological development trajectory, especially with explicit tie-ins to telecom constraints (latency, privacy, long sequence handling).\n- Systematic integration techniques with explicit inter-section evolution:\n  - Section 3 presents telecom-oriented techniques and shows a progressive combination of methods:\n    - 3.1 “RAG for Telecom-Specific Knowledge” (dynamic retrieval and grounding)\n    - 3.2 “PEFT Methods” (LoRA, adapters, prefix tuning)\n    - 3.3 “Prompt Engineering” (domain prompts, multi-step reasoning, RAG augmentation)\n    - 3.4 “Multimodal Fusion” (cross-modal attention, GNNs, contrastive learning)\n    - 3.5 “Hybrid RAG-Fine-Tuning Pipelines” (explicitly combining 3.1 and 3.2; scaling/edge considerations)\n    - 3.6 “Edge Deployment and Federated Learning” (distribution, privacy-preserving updates)\n  - The survey frequently signals evolution and synergy with phrases like “Building upon the prompt engineering techniques discussed in Section 3.3, multimodal fusion emerges…” and “Building on the multimodal fusion techniques discussed in Section 3.4, hybrid RAG-fine-tuning pipelines emerge…,” which clearly indicate methodological progression and interconnections.\n- Consistent cross-references and forward-linking:\n  - Many sections explicitly connect previous foundations to subsequent applications (e.g., 1.2 linking to 1.3; 2.4 bridging to 2.5; 3.5 to 3.6; 4.1–4.6 linking techniques to use cases). This reinforces evolutionary coherence and illuminates how methods translate into telecom workflows.\n\nAreas that reduce the score:\n- Minor structural inconsistency: The header “1.2 Core Principles and Architectures of LLMs” appears duplicated (“### 1.2 Core Principles and Architectures of LLMs” repeated), which could confuse readers and slightly weakens classification clarity.\n- Some evolutionary stages are implied rather than deeply analyzed:\n  - While Section 1.1 maps the macro-evolution well, later sections occasionally mix method families and applications without a formalized taxonomy or timeline of telecom-specific method adoption. For instance, Section 2.6 “Emerging Architectural Innovations” lists heterogeneous innovations (Energy Transformer, Zebra, Mamba) but does not fully articulate a chronological evolution or comparative adoption pathway within telecom contexts.\n- Connections between certain techniques could be tightened:\n  - The survey effectively shows RAG+PEFT+Prompt synergy, but the inheritance between more novel attention alternatives (e.g., polynomial-based attention in 1.2, feedback attention, state space models in 2.6) and their specific progression or replacement patterns in telecom deployments is discussed at a high level without a systematic comparative framework.\n- Lack of a visual taxonomy or unified schema:\n  - Although the text-based classification is clear, the absence of a synthesized taxonomy/diagram or table mapping methods to telecom challenges and their historical evolution stages makes the method categorization less immediately digestible for readers, which slightly detracts from clarity and perceived systematic evolution.\n\nOverall, the survey does a strong job of organizing methods and tracing their evolution, especially from Transformer foundations through PEFT/RAG/edge paradigms, and frequently ensures coherence by cross-referencing sections. Minor structural duplication and a few underdeveloped connections keep it from attaining the highest score.", "Score: 3/5\n\nExplanation:\n- Strengths in metrics coverage and rationale:\n  - Section 6.2 (Performance Metrics and Evaluation Criteria) provides a thorough, telecom-targeted metric suite. It goes beyond generic NLP metrics to include:\n    - Task fidelity: precision/recall/F1 for fraud/security and classification tasks; an explicit critique of BLEU/ROUGE for technical correctness and the proposal of expert-reviewed correctness scores for generative outputs.\n    - Latency and real-time needs: time-to-first-token (TTFT), end-to-end latency, communication overhead/synchronization delay in federated setups—well aligned with telecom’s low-latency requirements.\n    - Scalability/resource efficiency: throughput, memory footprint, and energy consumption metrics—important for edge deployments and sustainability concerns in Sections 5.5/5.6.\n    - Robustness/adaptability: adversarial robustness, domain shift resilience, hallucination rate—reflecting operational realities described in Sections 5.3–5.4.\n    - Ethical/compliance: fairness, transparency/interpretability, privacy leakage tests—coherent with Sections 4.6 and 7.x.\n  - Section 6.1 (Benchmarking Frameworks) appropriately argues for telecom-specific benchmarking, including:\n    - Handling temporal/sequence tasks and heterogeneous modalities (“Telecom benchmarks must also account for heterogeneous data sources…”).\n    - Combining synthetic datasets (simulated failures) with real operational data, and the need for reproducibility and human-in-the-loop validation.\n    - Future directions emphasizing multimodality, efficiency-oriented benchmarking, and collaborative/open-source platforms.\n  - Section 6.4 (Task-Specific Benchmarking Results) reports indicative performance figures (e.g., 0.92 F1 for multimodal fraud models; AUC-ROC 88% for churn with CDRs; edge response time improvements) and links them to the metric dimensions above, reinforcing practical relevance.\n\n- Weaknesses in dataset diversity, specificity, and detail:\n  - The survey rarely names concrete, commonly used telecom datasets or gives dataset-level detail (scale, labeling protocols, access/licensing, modality breakdown). The discussion is mostly at the level of data types (network logs, standards, CDRs, tickets) or synthetic/real blends without exemplars.\n  - The few explicit mentions of a dataset are sparse and not elaborated:\n    - TeleQnA [117] is referenced (e.g., in Section 7.3 as a benchmark to assess telecom knowledge), but the survey does not describe its size, coverage, question types, or labeling methodology.\n  - In Section 6.1, while the proposal to mix synthetic failures and operational data is sensible, it does not enumerate established public datasets or provide concrete examples from security (e.g., widely used intrusion/fraud corpora), customer service (call center/chat datasets), or network logs (open CDR challenges). The same is true in Section 6.4 where results are presented (e.g., “CDR-trained models reach 88% AUC-ROC”) without dataset identification, scale, or splits.\n  - Other parts of the survey reinforce the absence of a dataset catalog. For instance:\n    - Section 1.6 (Scope/Objectives) promises benchmarking criteria (fairness, latency, domain adaptation) but does not pair them with specific datasets.\n    - Section 3.1 (RAG) and Section 3.4 (Multimodal Fusion) discuss telecom corpora (manuals, logs, tables, images) conceptually but do not detail representative datasets or curation practices.\n    - Section 4.x application chapters cite performance figures without dataset provenance, limiting reproducibility and comparative value.\n  - As a result, the dataset coverage does not meet the “diversity and detail” expectations for a comprehensive survey; it lacks descriptions of dataset scales, labeling methods, and application scenarios that would help practitioners choose benchmarks and understand limitations.\n\n- Rationality of dataset/metric choices:\n  - Metrics are well justified and closely aligned with telecom constraints (real-time, robustness, compliance), meeting the “academically sound and practically meaningful” criterion.\n  - Dataset rationale is discussed conceptually (privacy constraints, heterogeneity, concept drift, synthetic-real blends in Section 6.1; multimodality across the survey), but the lack of concrete dataset exemplars and characteristics weakens practical guidance and completeness.\n\nOverall judgment:\n- The review excels in identifying and motivating telecom-appropriate evaluation metrics and benchmarking dimensions, but it falls short on dataset diversity and detail. To reach 4–5 points, it would need a dedicated, well-annotated catalog of telecom-relevant datasets (e.g., public CDR challenges, open phishing/SMS spam corpora, intrusion/fraud benchmarks, call center dialogue datasets, 3GPP/standards corpora), including scale, modalities, labeling schemes, licensing/privacy notes, and typical use cases, with explicit mapping to the proposed metrics and tasks.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey provides a clear and generally well-structured comparison of major methods across several sections, with explicit contrasts of architectures, training paradigms, and integration techniques. It identifies advantages, disadvantages, similarities, and distinctions, and frequently explains differences in terms of architecture, learning objectives, and deployment assumptions. However, the comparison is not fully systematic end-to-end: some parts remain descriptive or fragmented, and a unifying multi-dimensional comparison framework (e.g., consistent axes across sections) is missing. Below are specific supports and gaps from the text.\n\nWhere the paper compares methods well:\n- Core architectures and objectives (Section 2.1 Core Architectures of LLMs)\n  - The survey contrasts encoder-only vs decoder-only vs encoder-decoder designs tied to task types: “While encoder-only models like BERT excel at bidirectional context understanding..., decoder-only models like GPT specialize in autoregressive generation...” (2.1). This anchors differences in architecture and objective.\n  - It explicitly contrasts attention variants to address complexity: “To address the quadratic complexity of standard softmax attention, researchers have developed more efficient alternatives... Polynomial-based attention... while feedback attention mechanisms enable processing of indefinitely long sequences...” (1.2; echoed in 2.1), explaining trade-offs in computational assumptions and sequence handling.\n  - Positional encoding variants are discussed with implications for sequence tasks: “relative positional encodings enhance handling of long sequences...” (2.1).\n\n- Training paradigms and PEFT (Section 2.2 Training Paradigms; Section 3.2 PEFT)\n  - Systematic coverage of pre-training vs task-specific fine-tuning vs PEFT and hybrid paradigms: “Two dominant strategies emerge...” (2.2), with pros/cons (compute, data scarcity, bias).\n  - Strong, structured comparison in 3.2: specific PEFT techniques are contrasted with use-case fit and constraints—“LoRA... interpretability-sensitive tasks,” “Prefix Tuning... dynamic context switching,” “Adapter Layers... predictive maintenance,” “Sparse Fine-Tuning... edge deployments,” plus “Method Selection and Hybrid Approaches.” This section clearly maps techniques to scenarios and trade-offs.\n\n- Efficiency and deployment trade-offs (Section 2.4 Parameter Efficiency and Scalability; Section 3.6 Edge Deployment and Federated Learning)\n  - Multiple techniques are compared with their benefits and limits: “Pruning eliminates redundant weights... Quantization... Knowledge distillation...” (2.4) and “Federated learning decentralizes... allowing edge devices... while preserving privacy...” (2.4), including deployment assumptions (privacy, bandwidth, latency) and risks (bias amplification, heterogeneity).\n  - Edge vs cloud vs hybrid design trade-offs are discussed: “Edge-based RAG... reduces latency... challenges in synchronizing distributed knowledge bases...” (3.6), which explicitly states pros/cons and operational constraints.\n\n- Hybrid pipelines (Section 3.5)\n  - Clear articulation of why hybrid RAG + fine-tuning addresses standalone limitations: “fine-tuning alone struggles with rapidly evolving information, and RAG introduces latency; their integration balances adaptability with efficiency.” This is a concise, comparative rationale tied to objectives and assumptions.\n\n- Architecture comparison across tasks (Section 6.3 Comparative Analysis of LLM Architectures)\n  - This is the most systematic comparative section. It evaluates GPT vs BERT/RoBERTa vs LLaMA vs lightweight models across:\n    - Performance by task: “GPT-4... for customer service generation... BERT... for parsing telecom standards...” with concrete figures (“fine-tuned BERT... 84.6%... surpassing GPT-2 83%”).\n    - Efficiency and scalability: “Phi-2 augmented with RAG matches GPT-3.5’s accuracy... while using fewer parameters...” (edge viability) and “LoRA... minimal overhead.”\n    - Domain adaptation: “TeleRoBERTa... matches foundation model performance with 10x fewer parameters... for intent-driven management.”\n    - Robustness/hallucinations: “BERT-based models exhibit fewer hallucinations... RAG-augmented GPT-4 reduces hallucination rates by 40%...”\n    - Task-aligned selection guidance: “GPT-4 for generative tasks, BERT/RoBERTa for structured analysis, lightweight models... for edge deployment.”\n  - These comparisons are structured, multi-dimensional, and technically grounded in architectures, objectives, and deployment assumptions.\n\n- Benchmarking results that reflect method trade-offs (Section 6.4)\n  - Comparative outcomes are cited, e.g., “federated learning implementations maintain ≤3% precision loss versus centralized training,” and “RAG hybrids improve response relevance by 18%,” reinforcing practical trade-offs between accuracy and privacy/latency.\n\nWhere the comparison is weaker or less systematic:\n- Some sections are more descriptive than comparative:\n  - Emerging architectures (Section 2.6) lists Mamba, Energy Transformer, Zebra and notes their properties (“linear-time,” “integrates attention with energy-based models,” “alternates local and global attention”) but does not consistently contrast them across standardized dimensions (e.g., sequence length handling, memory footprint, typical telecom tasks, robustness).\n  - RAG (Section 3.1) mentions vector vs keyword retrieval and hybridization with PEFT but lacks a deeper, structured comparison of retrieval strategies (dense vs sparse, lexical vs semantic) and their telecom-specific trade-offs (e.g., recency, heterogeneity).\n- Limited unifying framework:\n  - There is no single comparative schema applied consistently across all method families (e.g., a common set of dimensions like objective, compute/memory, data dependency, latency, robustness, reliability, fairness, typical telecom use cases). The comparisons appear in well-written islands (notably 3.2 and 6.3) rather than as a continuous, unified analysis.\n- Some comparisons are high-level:\n  - Early foundational sections (1.2, 2.1–2.3) occasionally state trade-offs (e.g., quadratic attention vs efficient variants; in-context learning strengths vs prompt sensitivity) but without deeper side-by-side contrasts (assumptions, failure modes, empirical trade-offs) to the same rigor as later sections.\n\nOverall judgment:\n- The review clearly compares multiple methods across meaningful dimensions in several places (especially PEFT and architecture-task alignment), articulates advantages and disadvantages, and explains differences by architecture, objectives, and deployment assumptions. However, the comparisons are unevenly distributed; some sections read more like descriptive listings, and a consistent cross-method comparative framework is missing. Hence, a 4-point score is appropriate: strong, clear comparisons with notable depth in key sections, but not fully systematic across the whole review.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\n\nOverall, the survey provides meaningful, technically grounded analytical interpretation across key methods and integration techniques, consistently relating architectural choices and training paradigms to telecom-specific constraints. It explains several fundamental causes of method differences (e.g., attention’s quadratic complexity driving latency/resource bottlenecks; in-context learning’s gradient-descent approximation underpinning rapid domain adaptation) and articulates trade-offs (accuracy vs. efficiency, centralization vs. privacy, adaptability vs. latency) with reasonable depth. However, the analysis depth is uneven: certain sections remain largely descriptive, with limited mechanistic detail, fewer explicit assumptions, or underdeveloped failure-mode discussions. Below I cite specific sections and sentences that support this assessment.\n\nStrengths in critical analysis, trade-off articulation, and synthesis:\n- Section 1.2 (Core Principles and Architectures) goes beyond description to explain underlying mechanisms and their telecom relevance:\n  - “To address the quadratic complexity of standard softmax attention, researchers have developed more efficient alternatives…” and “Polynomial-based attention schemes maintain expressive power while reducing computational costs [18], while feedback attention mechanisms enable processing of indefinitely long sequences through latent representation recall [19].” This ties the O(n^2) cost of attention to resource constraints and motivates alternative attention designs for telecom settings.\n  - “Transformers can approximate gradient descent when processing in-context examples [20], explaining their remarkable few-shot adaptation capabilities…” This is a technically grounded insight into why ICL works and why telecom operators can leverage it for rapid configuration changes.\n  - “Research shows that Transformer models can learn positional relationships implicitly through causal masking, even without explicit positional encodings [16].” This highlights assumptions about position encoding and implications for time-series/log processing in telecom.\n- Section 2.1 (Core Architectures of LLMs) articulates limitations and future design directions:\n  - “Sequence Length Limits: Quadratic attention complexity hinders processing of ultra-long sequences…” and “Future directions include hybrid architectures (e.g., combining Transformers with state-space models [72]) and hardware-aware optimizations [73].” This identifies root causes of scaling problems and proposes principled remedies relevant to telecom’s long sequences.\n- Section 2.2 (Training Paradigms) discusses efficiency and adaptation trade-offs:\n  - “Pre-training faces computational challenges due to the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms… [74].” and “Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)… crucial for deploying LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices…” These sentences connect method design to telecom constraints (compute, edge).\n  - “Retrieval-augmented fine-tuning … ideal for troubleshooting or compliance tasks requiring up-to-date information.” This synthesizes RAG with fine-tuning to address domain drift and compliance—core telecom challenges.\n- Section 2.4 (Parameter Efficiency and Scalability) has strong reflective commentary on risks and trade-offs:\n  - “Compression can inadvertently amplify biases, as noted in [98], while heterogeneous infrastructures demand modular designs, per [99].” This is precisely the kind of interpretive insight the rubric seeks—why efficiency methods may have fairness implications and deployment assumptions.\n  - The section balances techniques (quantization, pruning, distillation, FL, edge-cloud split) with “Dynamic Resource Allocation and Lightweight Architectures” and “Challenges and Future Directions,” making the trade-offs explicit.\n- Section 3.1 (RAG) and 3.5 (Hybrid RAG-Fine-Tuning Pipelines) provide clear causal reasoning and synthesis:\n  - “A significant advantage of RAG in telecom is its ability to reduce hallucinations by anchoring responses in verified sources [110].” This explains the mechanism for hallucination mitigation.\n  - “While fine-tuning alone struggles with rapidly evolving information, and RAG introduces latency, their integration balances adaptability with efficiency…” This is a succinct, well-supported trade-off analysis and synthesis across methods.\n- Section 3.6 (Edge Deployment and Federated Learning) recognizes systemic constraints and mitigation:\n  - “Edge RAG faces challenges in synchronizing distributed knowledge bases and maintaining retrieval accuracy under resource constraints…” and “Federated learning… mitigated via gradient compression and adaptive aggregation (e.g., FedAvg) [130].” This names the design tensions and indicates targeted solutions, grounded in telecom realities.\n- Section 5.2 (Computational and Resource Constraints) is particularly strong:\n  - “The attention mechanism scales as O(n^2)… Training LLMs is equally resource-intensive… Memory bandwidth bottlenecks further exacerbate these challenges…” and “SparseBERT shows that diagonal elements in attention matrices can be pruned without degrading accuracy [154].”\n  - The link to “AttentionLego… Processing-In-Memory” shows deep synthesis across architecture, hardware, and telecom workloads—exactly the multi-line research integration the rubric rewards.\n- Sections 5.3 (Bias and Fairness) and 5.4 (Hallucination and Reliability) provide reflective, multi-layer mitigation strategies:\n  - Bias: “Adopting fairness-aware training… adversarial debiasing… human-in-the-loop oversight…” and the caution that “over-correction might lead to ‘reverse discrimination’…” This demonstrates nuanced understanding of method limitations and deployment assumptions.\n  - Hallucination: “RAG frameworks mitigate hallucination by tethering LLM outputs to externally retrieved, domain-specific knowledge…” and “Post-generation validation techniques… can detect and correct hallucinations.” Clear causal mechanisms and practical trade-offs are discussed.\n\nAreas where analysis depth is uneven or underdeveloped:\n- Section 2.6 (Emerging Architectural Innovations) sometimes remains descriptive, with limited mechanistic detail:\n  - “Hybrid architectures integrating convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with Transformer-based layers can process time-series signal data more efficiently…” This claim aligns with intuition but lacks deeper analysis of when and why CNNs outperform pure attention for specific telecom modalities, or assumptions about stationarity/non-stationarity in signals.\n  - “Edge-enabled architectures … TinyGPT … optimized for edge deployment.” The commentary is high-level; it does not discuss failure modes, rank constraints, or layer placement strategies (e.g., split learning boundaries) in sufficient technical depth.\n- Section 3.2 (PEFT) is informative but could further explain underlying causes and assumptions:\n  - It outlines LoRA, prefix tuning, adapters, and sparse fine-tuning, and offers task-based recommendations (“LoRA excels in interpretability-sensitive tasks…”). However, it does not deeply analyze why particular layers benefit from low-rank updates, how rank choice affects representation geometry, or where PEFT fails (e.g., in heavily compositional tasks).\n- Section 3.4 (Multimodal Fusion) gives useful techniques (cross-modal attention, graph fusion, contrastive learning) yet lacks detailed causal discussion:\n  - The section could better articulate alignment objectives’ failure modes (e.g., negative transfer across modalities) and assumptions (e.g., graph homophily in telecom topologies) that determine success.\n- Throughout, quantitative comparative evidence is sparse. While the analysis is conceptually sound and well synthesized, many claims are not backed by concrete performance counterfactuals or ablation-driven explanations, which would elevate the critique to a “5” under the rubric.\n\nConclusion:\nThe survey clearly advances beyond descriptive summary. It explains method differences and their root causes (especially complexity, latency, domain drift, hallucination, privacy), analyzes trade-offs, and synthesizes across architectures, training paradigms, and deployment models with telecom-specific constraints. The depth is strong in several sections (1.2, 2.4, 3.1/3.5, 5.2–5.4) but uneven in others (2.6, 3.2, 3.4), and more explicit discussion of assumptions and failure modes would improve the overall critical analysis. Hence, the section merits 4 points under the provided criteria.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe survey’s Gap/Future Work discussion is primarily concentrated in Section 9.2 “Future Research Directions,” with supporting gap identification spread across earlier challenges sections (Sections 2.2, 2.5, 5.1–5.6, 6.1–6.5, 7.1–7.5, 8.1–8.5). Overall, the paper identifies a broad, coherent set of research gaps across data, methods, systems, ethics/regulation, and operations, and ties them to telecom-specific constraints. However, the analysis of each gap’s impact and background tends to be brief rather than deeply developed, and concrete problem formulations, measurement protocols, and actionable research hypotheses are limited. Hence, the work earns a 4: comprehensive gap identification with somewhat shallow analysis per gap.\n\nEvidence and rationale, with specific parts that support the score:\n\n1) Methods and architectures gaps are clearly identified, with telecom relevance, but analysis is brief:\n- Section 9.2, “1. Efficient and Scalable Architectures for Telecom-Specific Tasks”: “Future research must prioritize architectures that balance performance with computational efficiency, particularly for resource-constrained telecom environments. Innovations like selective state-space models (e.g., [9]) offer linear-time complexity for long-sequence processing, ideal for network traffic analysis or predictive maintenance.” This pinpoints method gaps (efficient long-sequence processing) and states importance for telecom, but stops short of deeper impact analysis (e.g., quantitative targets, failure modes, interoperability constraints, or standardized latency budgets).\n- Section 9.2 also mentions “hardware-accelerated attention mechanisms” ([73]), “layerwise grouped local-global attention” ([24]), and “feedback-augmented models” ([19]) as promising, but does not deeply discuss trade-offs or deployment constraints beyond indicating their potential.\n\n2) Domain adaptation/data-centric gaps are acknowledged, but the depth is moderate:\n- Section 2.5 “Domain-Specific Adaptation” highlights “scarcity of labeled telecom datasets” and proposes self-supervised/synthetic data ([102]). It also flags privacy constraints and edge deployment costs; however, Section 9.2 doesn’t fully advance this into concrete future work items on telecom dataset pipelines, FAIR-compliant curation, or standardized labeling protocols despite referencing related concerns elsewhere (e.g., Section 6.1 benchmarking requirements and Section 6.2 ethical metrics).\n- Section 9.2, “2. Domain-Specific Adaptation and Fine-Tuning,” identifies PEFT (LoRA [202]), multimodal fusion, and energy-based models as needed advances, but does not deeply analyze the impact on specific telecom subdomains (e.g., RAN optimization vs. OSS/BSS workflows), data lifecycle governance, or cross-vendor interoperability.\n\n3) Ethical and regulatory gaps are comprehensively listed but not fully developed into research agendas:\n- Section 9.2, “3. Ethical and Regulatory Compliance,” calls for advances in fairness, transparency, reliability, and GDPR alignment, consistent with earlier sections detailing risks (Section 5.1 data privacy and security; Section 5.3 bias; Section 5.4 hallucination; Section 7.2 regulatory frameworks; Section 7.3 transparency). The paper thoroughly surfaces the issues, but the future work lacks detailed proposals for measurable compliance tooling, standardized audits, or controlled trials (e.g., fairness benchmarks tailored to telecom, robust hallucination stress-testing protocols).\n- The importance is established (e.g., high stakes in fraud/security/compliance), but specific impact pathways (e.g., how fairness failures propagate through telecom operations, or cost models of compliance) are not deeply analyzed.\n\n4) Systems-level gaps (edge, federated, scalability, sustainability) are well covered, with moderate analysis:\n- Section 9.2, “4. Edge and Federated Learning for Distributed Intelligence,” proposes FL and hybrid frameworks with privacy and real-time constraints; it builds on earlier detailed challenges (Section 5.2 computational constraints; Section 3.6 edge/federation; Section 8.1 FL; Section 8.2 edge-cloud) and shows why this matters (latency, privacy). However, it stops short of detailing concrete research questions like gradient compression targets, scheduling policies under 6G URLLC, or standardized privacy-loss metrics for telecom.\n- Section 9.2, “6. Sustainability and Environmental Impact,” highlights green AI strategies and aligns with Section 5.6’s energy/carbon analysis; it identifies the importance clearly, but does not propose rigorous, telecom-specific energy benchmarks or lifecycle accounting schemes.\n\n5) Human-AI collaboration and autonomous systems are included, with limited depth on impact:\n- Section 9.2, “7. Human-AI Collaboration and Autonomous Systems,” notes LLMs could enable self-healing networks and meta-cognitive agents, linking to earlier governance/oversight needs (Sections 7.4–7.5). Importance is clear, but there is little elaboration on socio-technical impact (e.g., operator role redesign, training requirements, liability frameworks) or formal evaluation protocols for HITL efficacy in telecom.\n\n6) The survey ties gaps to earlier sections that establish background and importance:\n- Data/privacy/security risks: Section 5.1 explicitly analyzes “risk of unintended data leakage” and “black-box nature complicates compliance.” This strengthens the motivation in Section 9.2 for privacy-preserving methods.\n- Compute/latency/scalability: Section 5.2 details “quadratic complexity…prohibitively expensive for long-context tasks” and memory bottlenecks; Section 5.5 covers latency/throughput. These underpin Section 9.2’s efficient-architecture/edge deployment directions.\n- Bias and fairness: Section 5.3 thoroughly covers implications and mitigation strategies, motivating the ethical compliance direction in Section 9.2.\n- Hallucination/reliability: Section 5.4 establishes why reliability is critical; Section 9.2 mentions reliability but does not create concrete mitigation work packages beyond referencing known approaches.\n\nWhy this merits a 4 rather than 5:\n- Breadth: The review comprehensively enumerates major gaps across data, methods, systems, ethics, sustainability, and human oversight.\n- Depth: The analysis is competent but generally brief. It seldom provides detailed causal chains, quantified impacts, specific research hypotheses, or telecom-specific measurement frameworks per gap. It points to promising techniques and references, yet lacks deep, problem-oriented formulations (e.g., explicit characterization of concept drift under telecom workloads, standardized latency budgets for specific telecom tasks, or concrete fairness audit protocols tailored to telecom).\n- Missing actionable details: Limited attention to concrete dataset creation pipelines and FAIR-compliant telecom corpora (despite Section 2.5 and 6.1 nods), robust adversarial security research agendas specifically for telecom LLM deployments, and standardized benchmarks for hallucination under mission-critical telecom conditions.\n\nConstructive suggestions to strengthen the Gap/Future Work section:\n- Add telecom-specific problem statements per gap (e.g., “Design FL aggregation under non-IID traffic with URLLC constraints; target X ms latency and Y privacy-loss bound”).\n- Propose standardized fairness/hallucination benchmarks for telecom (multi-lingual, low-resource dialects; long-context log analysis) and concrete audit protocols.\n- Detail data-centric future work: FAIR-compliant dataset pipelines, labeling standards, privacy-preserving synthetic data evaluation frameworks for telecom.\n- Include measurable sustainability goals (energy per inference, carbon per deployment) and reporting standards for telecom LLMs.\n- Outline socio-technical research on operator workflows, governance, and liability in autonomous network management.\n\nIn sum, the review identifies the right gaps comprehensively and maps them to telecom constraints, but the analysis per gap is generally concise and would benefit from deeper, actionable elaboration—consistent with a score of 4.", "4\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey proposes several forward-looking research directions grounded in clearly articulated gaps and real-world telecom needs, but the analysis of potential impact and the actionable pathways are somewhat brief in places.\n\nEvidence supporting the score:\n- Tight linkage to gaps and real-world constraints:\n  - Section 5 (Challenges and Limitations) identifies core gaps: privacy/security (5.1), computational/resource constraints (5.2), bias/fairness (5.3), hallucination/reliability (5.4), scalability/real-time processing (5.5), and environmental impact (5.6). These problems are then explicitly addressed by later future directions.\n  - Section 8.1 (Federated Learning for Distributed Telecom Intelligence) directly tackles privacy and non-IID data challenges: “Telecom data is inherently non-IID… adaptive aggregation algorithms (e.g., FedProx or SCAFFOLD)… ternary quantization… low-rank decomposition and 8-bit quantization” and aligns with GDPR and operational privacy needs (“By decentralizing model training… aligns seamlessly with the telecom industry’s need for scalable, secure, and efficient AI solutions.”).\n  - Section 8.2 (Edge-Cloud Collaborative Learning Architectures) addresses latency and bandwidth constraints through task partitioning (“lightweight operations at the edge… offloaded to the cloud”), hardware-aware acceleration (“processing-in-memory (PIM)… Fourier transforms”), and proposes “Hierarchical Processing” and “Federated Hybrid Learning” as concrete strategies tied to real telecom workloads like “real-time traffic anomaly detection” and “instant responses (e.g., FAQs).”\n  - Section 8.3 (6G-Driven LLM Deployment at the Edge) connects to 6G URLLC and eMBB real-world requirements: “split learning partitions LLM layers between edge and cloud,” “network slicing for prioritized LLM traffic,” and security/federated training trade-offs relevant to GDPR and low latency. It lists telecom-specific use cases (real-time network optimization, automated customer service, DRL-based anti-jamming).\n  - Section 8.4 (Resource-Efficient LLM Optimization Techniques) offers concrete, actionable techniques (quantization, pruning-aware training, hybrid pruning+quantization, knowledge distillation, federated learning integration) and explicitly frames future research priorities: “Adaptive Optimization,” “Energy-Aware Training,” and “Cross-Stack Optimization,” which map to sustainability and deployment constraints in telecom.\n  - Section 8.5 (Emerging Paradigms: NTN and Reconfigurable Environments) proposes innovative directions beyond terrestrial networks, addressing global access and dynamic deployment via NTNs with specific mitigation strategies for higher latency/bandwidth constraints through “quantization and pruning,” “hybrid edge-cloud architectures,” and FL for intermittently connected regions. It also flags ethical/governance concerns (misinformation/disinformation risk and equitable access) with calls for robust governance.\n  - Section 9.2 (Future Research Directions) consolidates a clear set of research topics that directly answer the identified gaps: efficient and scalable architectures (state-space models like Mamba, PIM, grouped local-global attention, feedback attention), domain-specific adaptation (PEFT, multimodal fusion, energy-based architectures), ethical/regulatory compliance (hallucination mitigation, GDPR), edge and federated learning, sustainability, and human-AI collaboration. These are framed as actionable areas that address operational latency, privacy, bias, and energy footprints.\n\n- Innovation and specificity:\n  - The survey goes beyond standard suggestions by proposing telecom-tailored ideas such as “telecom-specific explainability benchmarks,” “neuro-symbolic hybridization for SLA checks,” “network slicing prioritization for LLM traffic,” and “split learning for edge-cloud partitioning.” It also references concrete algorithms and mechanisms (FedProx/SCAFFOLD, LoRA/PEFT, state-space models like Mamba, PIM accelerators, sparse/MoE activation) and applies them to telecom use cases, which strengthens the practical relevance.\n  - The NTN and reconfigurable environments section (8.5) is notably forward-looking, extending LLM deployment to satellite/LEO contexts and discussing adaptive partitioning under variable network conditions.\n\n- Where the survey falls short of a 5:\n  - While directions are numerous and well-aligned with real-world telecom constraints, the discussion of academic and practical impact is often high-level. For instance, Section 9.2 lists strong themes but provides limited depth on methodological roadmaps, evaluation protocols, or concrete experimental designs beyond a few mentions (e.g., TeleQnA, explainability benchmarks).\n  - Some proposed directions, although important, are established in the broader AI systems literature (e.g., edge-cloud collaboration, FL, quantization/pruning), and the analysis does not consistently delve into the causes of telecom-specific gaps or provide detailed plans for addressing them across heterogeneous infrastructures and regulatory landscapes.\n  - Actionability could be heightened with more explicit frameworks or step-by-step deployment guidance (e.g., standardizing cross-operator FL protocols, detailed compliance monitoring pipelines, or concrete federated benchmarking schemes).\n\nOverall judgment:\nThe paper provides a robust, forward-looking set of research directions tightly coupled to identified telecom gaps and real-world needs, with multiple specific and innovative topics. However, it stops short of offering a thoroughly analyzed, highly actionable roadmap with deep impact analysis across all proposed directions. Hence, a score of 4 is appropriate."]}

{"name": "f1", "paperour": [4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4], "reason": ["Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\n- Research Objective Clarity: The Introduction clearly states the survey’s purpose: “This survey aims to provide a comprehensive exploration of LLMs' principles, techniques, and transformative opportunities in telecommunications. By synthesizing current research, identifying key challenges, and projecting future developments, we seek to offer a definitive scholarly examination of this rapidly evolving technological frontier...” (Section 1, Introduction). This objective is aligned with core issues in the field (principles, techniques, opportunities) and indicates an intent to synthesize, analyze challenges, and forecast trends. However, the objective remains broad (“comprehensive exploration”) and lacks explicit research questions, a defined scope boundary, or a clear articulation of what unique contributions or taxonomy the survey will deliver compared to existing surveys (e.g., [30], [61], [62]). The absence of an Abstract (not present in the provided content) also reduces upfront clarity.\n\n- Background and Motivation: The Introduction provides a strong contextual foundation. It motivates the survey by highlighting the complexity of modern telecom networks and the promise of LLMs to handle multidimensional data and complex protocol understanding (Section 1: “The telecommunications landscape is increasingly characterized by complex, multidimensional networks…”). It substantiates motivation with concrete application examples—network configuration via natural language interfaces [5] and autonomous operation/maintenance in optical networks [2]—and identifies critical challenges (interpretability, domain adaptation, efficiency, ethics [6]). It also points to emerging techniques like RAG, instruction tuning, and multimodal learning [7] as active solutions (Section 1). These elements convincingly support why the survey is needed.\n\n- Practical Significance and Guidance Value: The Introduction articulates clear practical relevance by pointing to impactful application areas (network security, performance optimization, protocol analysis, intelligent network management [3]) and emphasizes a “fundamental shift towards more accessible, intelligent, and adaptive communication systems.” It signals that the survey will synthesize current research and project future developments, which is valuable for researchers and practitioners. Nonetheless, the guidance value could be strengthened by explicitly stating deliverables (e.g., a taxonomy, comparative analyses, evaluation frameworks, design principles, or practitioner checklists) and detailing the survey methodology (e.g., corpus selection criteria, time window, inclusion/exclusion criteria). Such additions would make the practical utility more concrete.\n\nOverall, the Introduction is clear, well-motivated, and aligned with key field challenges and opportunities, but the lack of an Abstract, explicit research questions, defined scope, and stated unique contributions prevents a top score.", "4\n\nExplanation:\n- Method Classification Clarity: The survey presents a relatively clear and coherent classification of methods that maps well to the technical dimensions of LLMs in telecommunications. Section 2 “Architectural Foundations and Model Design” is structured into logical categories—specialized transformer architectures (2.1), pre-training and knowledge representation (2.2), computational efficiency and model compression (2.3), multimodal integration and cross-domain fusion (2.4), and robust and secure design principles (2.5). This macro-structure is reasonable and reflects key methodological components in the field. Similarly, Section 3 “Training Methodologies and Knowledge Integration” is organized into domain-specific corpus construction (3.1), retrieval-augmented knowledge integration (3.2), privacy-preserving training (3.3), adaptive knowledge representation (3.4), and multimodal knowledge integration (3.5), which complements the architectural focus by covering data, training, and knowledge mechanisms.\n\n  Support:\n  - Section 2.2 explicitly positions itself in the method taxonomy: “Advanced pre-training and knowledge representation strategies have emerged as foundational mechanisms… bridging the architectural innovations discussed previously with computational efficiency techniques to follow.”\n  - Section 2.4 clearly delineates multimodal integration as a distinct class: “This subsection explores the intricate mechanisms by which LLMs transcend unimodal boundaries, synthesizing knowledge across diverse representational spaces.”\n  - Section 3.1 frames corpus construction as a foundational training methodology for telecom: “Domain-specific corpus construction represents a critical frontier… enabling precise knowledge integration and enhanced performance.”\n  - Section 3.2 positions RAG within the training/knowledge integration pipeline: “Retrieval-augmented knowledge integration represents a sophisticated paradigm… building upon the foundational work in domain-specific corpus construction.”\n\n  Limitations:\n  - There is noticeable overlap between multimodal topics in Sections 2.4 and 3.5; both cover cross-modal fusion and alignment without a clearly differentiated scope, which blurs category boundaries. For instance, 2.4 focuses on multimodal integration at the architectural level, and 3.5 revisits multimodal knowledge integration with similar themes (“converting multi-modal signals into a unified linguistic space”), causing redundancy.\n  - “Adaptive Knowledge Representation” (3.4) mixes information-theoretic compression (matrix entropy, singular value decomposition) with representation learning, which overlaps with 2.3 “Computational Efficiency and Model Compression Techniques.” This weakens categorical separation.\n  - Section 2.5 “Robust and Secure Model Design Principles” bundles disparate themes (knowledge graphs, PEFT security surfaces, modality collaboration, ethical considerations, benchmarking) without a strict taxonomy within robustness/security (e.g., adversarial robustness, privacy, trust calibration, verifiability), making the internal structure less crisp.\n\n- Evolution of Methodology: The paper does present a developmental progression and methodological trends, with explicit connective language that guides the reader through an evolving path from architecture to pre-training, efficiency, multimodality, and security, then to training pipelines that complement architecture. Transitional sentences make the evolution visible:\n  - Section 2.2: “Building upon the specialized transformer architectures explored earlier…”\n  - Section 2.4: “Building upon the computational efficiency strategies discussed in the previous section… setting the stage for the security and robust design principles to be discussed in the subsequent section.”\n  - Section 3.2: “Retrieval-augmented knowledge integration… Complementing the previously discussed corpus construction strategies…”\n  - Section 3.4: “Adaptive knowledge representation… building upon the privacy-preserving methodologies discussed in the previous section.”\n\n  The survey also points out trajectories and future directions in several places, indicating evolutionary trends:\n  - Section 2.1 and 2.2 discuss the shift from general transformers to domain-tailored architectures and domain-specific pre-training/PEFT.\n  - Section 2.3 outlines the movement towards efficiency via PEFT, SVD-based compression, MoE, federated learning, and hybrid compression strategies.\n  - Section 2.4 and 3.5 reflect the trend toward multimodal fusion and cross-domain reasoning.\n  - Section 2.5 emphasizes a trajectory toward robust, context-aware architectures and comprehensive multimodal evaluation frameworks for security and trustworthiness.\n  - Section 3.1 to 3.2 shows an evolution from building domain corpora to integrating dynamic external knowledge via RAG.\n\n  Limitations:\n  - While transitions are stated, the evolution is not systematically periodized or presented as a clear timeline of methodological stages in telecom LLM development. The survey lacks a consolidated roadmap or diagram that traces phases (e.g., from generic NLP methods to telecom-specific LLMs, to RAG agents, to multimodal co-pilots, to secure and privacy-preserving systems).\n  - Some sections predominantly restate general LLM progress without consistently tying back to telecom-specific methodological evolution; for example, 3.4’s heavy focus on compression and information theory (“Language Modeling Is Compression,” “matrix entropy”) is less explicitly situated in a telecom development path, which slightly dilutes the narrative of domain-specific evolution.\n  - Redundancy in multimodal coverage (2.4 and 3.5) disrupts a clean evolutionary storyline by revisiting similar ground without clarifying how training-side multimodality advances beyond architecture-side multimodality.\n\nOverall judgment:\n- The classification is relatively clear and largely reasonable, offering a coherent macro-structure across architecture, training, efficiency, multimodality, and security. The evolution is presented with connective statements and emerging trends, but suffers from overlaps (multimodal, compression vs adaptive representation) and lacks a more systematic chronological or staged depiction of telecom-specific method development. Therefore, a score of 4 is appropriate.", "3\n\nExplanation:\n- Diversity of datasets and metrics: The survey mentions several telecom-relevant datasets and benchmarks, indicating breadth but lacking depth. In Section 3.1 (Domain-Specific Corpus Construction), it cites TSpec-LLM [7], SPEC5G [31], ORAN-Bench-13K [34], and domain-specific corpora like Tele-LLMs [15] and TelecomGPT [68]. In Section 5 (Security Applications), it references LLMcap for PCAP failure detection [49] and PLLM-CS for satellite networks [51]. For multimodal and general LLM evaluation, it mentions SEED-Bench-2 [72] and surveys on multimodal benchmarking [30], [61], [62], [63], [75]. This demonstrates reasonable coverage across telecom standards, RAN, PCAP/network security, and multimodal evaluation.\n  - However, the review does not provide detailed descriptions of these datasets’ scale (e.g., number of documents, packets, tokens, samples), labeling methodology, or precise application scenarios. For instance, SPEC5G [31] and TSpec-LLM [7] are named but not characterized; ORAN-Bench-13K [34] is introduced without details of tasks, splits, or metrics; and security datasets/benchmarks commonly used in the field (e.g., CICIDS2017, UNSW-NB15, KDD’99) are not mentioned at all.\n- Coverage and rationality of metrics: Metrics are touched on but not comprehensively or systematically presented. The survey references:\n  - Matrix entropy as an evaluation perspective [24] in Sections 2.4 and 5.4.\n  - A single performance claim (“100% accuracy on benchmark datasets” [51]) in Section 5.2, without context on dataset, class balance, or complementary metrics.\n  - “Beyond Perplexity: Multi-dimensional Safety Evaluation of LLM Compression” [60] and LLM-KICK [84] in Section 7.4, indicating awareness of safety and capability evaluations.\n  - Multimodal evaluation surveys and benchmarks [30], [63], [72], but no concrete metric families are enumerated.\n  - Retrieval scoring (cosine similarity) and a ranking function R(q, d) in Section 3.2, which formalizes retrieval but does not translate into evaluation metrics like Recall@k, MRR, or nDCG.\n  - There is no systematic coverage of key telecom-relevant evaluation dimensions and metrics such as detection precision/recall/F1, ROC-AUC, false positive rate, latency and throughput for real-time systems, QoS/SLA compliance, energy and memory footprint, or human-in-the-loop verification metrics for standards parsing. Likewise, generation metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, factuality/faithfulness measures), code-generation pass@k, and calibration/reliability metrics are not discussed.\n- Support from specific sections:\n  - Section 3.1 mentions dataset construction and specific telecom datasets/benchmarks [7], [31], [34] but lacks scale/label details.\n  - Section 3.2 formalizes retrieval (“R(q, d)” and cosine similarity) but does not connect to standard retrieval evaluation metrics.\n  - Section 2.4 introduces matrix entropy [24] as an innovative metric, yet without contrasting it against conventional metrics or showing applicability to telecom tasks.\n  - Section 5.2 cites “100% accuracy” for PLLM-CS [51] but does not discuss robustness, generalization, or complementary metrics.\n  - Sections 6.3 and 7.4 acknowledge evaluation frameworks and safety assessments [72], [60], [84] but provide no metric taxonomy or mapping to task types.\n- Overall judgment: The review references multiple datasets and several evaluation-related works, demonstrating awareness of the domain. However, it does not offer detailed dataset descriptions (scale, labels, scenario coverage) or a structured, task-specific metric taxonomy. The choices are generally reasonable for telecom LLMs but not sufficiently explained to support rigorous comparative assessment. Therefore, it merits a score of 3 under the given rubric.", "3\n\nExplanation:\nOverall, Sections 2 and 3 present a broad, conceptually organized survey of architectures and training methodologies, but the comparison of methods is largely descriptive and fragmented rather than systematic.\n\nWhere the paper does well:\n- In Section 3.2 Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge Integration, the review offers a structured framing of the retrieval process: “The retrieval process typically involves three critical components: (1) query representation, (2) knowledge base indexing, and (3) relevant document ranking…” and even adds a formalization “Mathematically, the retrieval process can be formalized as a ranking function R(q, d)…,” which shows clarity and some technical grounding for one method family.\n- In Section 2.3 Computational Efficiency and Model Compression Techniques, multiple efficiency strategies are covered (PEFT [10], ASVD [16], pruning/editing [17], MoE [18], federated learning [19], weight disentanglement [20]) with brief notes on their goals or benefits, e.g., “Methods such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and prompt tuning demonstrate remarkable efficiency,” “ASVD… enabling compression rates of 10-20% without substantial performance degradation,” and “MoE… significantly reduce computational overhead while maintaining model expressivity.” This acknowledges advantages at a high level across several method families.\n- Section 2.4 mentions evaluation ideas like “innovative metrics like matrix entropy” [24], hinting at how methods might be assessed across modalities, which is useful for comparison frames.\n\nWhere the paper falls short for a higher score:\n- The survey rarely contrasts methods along multiple explicit dimensions (e.g., architecture, data dependency, learning strategy, inference cost, privacy/security, domain transferability). The content in Section 2.1 Specialized Transformer Architectures and Section 2.2 Advanced Pre-training and Knowledge Representation Strategies largely lists approaches and examples (e.g., “[8] exemplifies this approach…,” “[5] highlights the potential…,” “[2] introduces a framework…”), without juxtaposing them or explaining distinctions in assumptions/objectives or trade-offs.\n- Advantages and disadvantages are not systematically articulated. For instance, Section 2.3 names several techniques but does not detail drawbacks or situational limitations (e.g., MoE routing complexity, communication overhead in federated learning, or accuracy–privacy trade-offs in differential privacy discussed in Section 3.3). Section 3.3 Privacy-Preserving Training Methodologies enumerates federated learning, PEFT, knowledge editing, differential privacy, and encryption, but does not clearly compare their privacy guarantees, utility degradation, or deployment assumptions.\n- Commonalities/distinctions among methods are often implied rather than analyzed. In Section 3.1 Domain-Specific Corpus Construction and Section 3.4 Adaptive Knowledge Representation, the text points to multiple techniques (semantic segmentation, tokenization; SVD, matrix entropy), but does not contrast when one method is preferable over another, nor how their architectural or objective differences affect telecom tasks.\n- The review avoids deep technical contrast of multimodal methods in Section 2.4 and Section 3.5. It lists representative works and promising directions (“treating multi-modalities as foreign languages” [43], “adaptive alignment” [44], “AnyMAL” [46], “Uni-MoE” [47]), but does not provide a structured comparison of cross-modal fusion strategies, their assumptions (e.g., unified embedding vs. modality-specific experts), or trade-offs in efficiency and generalization.\n\nBecause the paper mentions pros/cons or differences sporadically and provides some structured description for RAG, but lacks a systematic, multi-dimensional comparative analysis across the broader method landscape, the comparison quality aligns with a 3: present but fragmented and relatively superficial rather than rigorous and comprehensive.", "Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey provides a broad, well-organized overview of architectural and training methodologies relevant to LLMs in telecommunications, but its critical analysis is mostly high-level and descriptive rather than deeply mechanistic. It occasionally offers interpretive remarks and minimal formalization, yet largely stops short of explaining the fundamental causes of method differences, explicit design trade-offs, and assumptions. The depth of reasoning is uneven across sections.\n\nEvidence supporting this assessment:\n- Section 2.3 (Computational Efficiency and Model Compression Techniques) offers some technically grounded commentary (e.g., “Activation-aware Singular Value Decomposition (ASVD) [16] provide sophisticated mechanisms for model dimensionality reduction. These techniques systematically manage activation distributions…” and “Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures… By activating only a subset of model parameters during inference…”). These sentences hint at underlying mechanisms (conditional computation and activation-aware compression), but the review does not analyze core trade-offs such as routing overhead, load balancing, communication cost in MoE, or rank-choice and layer selection in ASVD/LoRA. It remains descriptive and does not quantify or explain why and when these methods fail or excel.\n- Section 3.2 (Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge Integration) includes a minimal formalization (“Mathematically, the retrieval process can be formalized as a ranking function R(q, d)… often utilizing cosine similarity…”) which is a positive analytical step. However, the discussion does not examine fundamental causes of RAG’s performance differences versus domain fine-tuning or instruction tuning—e.g., retrieval noise, coverage gaps, latency–accuracy trade-offs, index staleness, or domain drift. The sentence “Emerging research highlights the potential of integrating multi-modal retrieval strategies…” remains aspirational without analysis of failure modes or costs.\n- Section 2.5 (Robust and Secure Model Design Principles) states that “The integration of external knowledge graphs with LLMs provides a promising avenue for improving factual accuracy and reducing hallucination risks [26],” but does not distinguish between KG-augmented prompting, retrieval pipelines, or structured reasoning, nor assess assumptions (coverage, consistency) or trade-offs (latency, maintenance, alignment). The analysis stays at a conceptual level.\n- Section 3.3 (Privacy-Preserving Training Methodologies) references federated learning, PEFT, knowledge editing, and differential privacy (e.g., “By introducing calibrated noise into the training process, differential privacy ensures that individual data points cannot be reconstructed…”). While identifying techniques, it does not discuss the privacy–utility trade-off (epsilon/delta choices), convergence impacts, statistical heterogeneity in federated settings, communication and system constraints, or attack surfaces introduced by PEFT adapters. This limits interpretive insight.\n- Section 2.4 (Multimodal Integration and Cross-Domain Knowledge Fusion) mentions mechanisms like cross-modal attention and adaptive representation learning, and introduces evaluation ideas (e.g., “matrix entropy” [24]). Yet it lacks analysis of modality alignment pitfalls (tokenization granularity, information loss, negative transfer), the assumptions behind “treating modalities as foreign languages,” or comparative evaluation of alignment strategies (contrastive vs. generative alignment).\n- Section 3.4 (Adaptive Knowledge Representation) shows interpretive ambition (“LLMs as sophisticated information compression algorithms” and references to matrix entropy [24] and ASVD [16]). However, it does not connect these compression perspectives to concrete emergent behavior differences, failure modes, or reproducible evaluation evidence. The commentary on “not all model layers contribute equally” is accurate but unexpanded.\n- Across Sections 2.1–2.5 and 3.1–3.5, the paper often states trajectories and promises (“Future advancements will likely focus on developing adaptive compression techniques…”, “Researchers are exploring approaches that dynamically adjust model architectures…”) without dissecting the mechanism-level reasons these directions are necessary or the conditions under which they succeed or fail.\n\nPositive elements:\n- The survey consistently links sections (e.g., connecting PEFT from Section 2.3 to multimodal adaptation in 2.4 and 3.5; bridging RAG in 3.2 to corpus strategies in 3.1), showing some synthesis across research lines.\n- There are scattered technically grounded remarks (ASVD and activation distributions, MoE conditional computation, retrieval similarity formalization, matrix entropy), indicating some effort toward interpretive analysis.\n\nOverall, while the paper moves beyond pure enumeration and attempts to connect themes, it does not systematically explain the fundamental causes of performance differences, design trade-offs, or assumptions across methods. The result is a survey with basic analytical comments and limited interpretive depth—consistent with a score of 3.\n\nResearch guidance value:\n- To strengthen critical analysis:\n  - Compare dense vs. MoE scaling with mechanism-level discussion: conditional routing benefits vs. load balancing, token-level expert assignment, communication costs, and failure modes (expert underutilization, gate collapse).\n  - Analyze PEFT trade-offs: LoRA rank selection, layer targeting, adapter placement vs. full fine-tuning; quantify effects on capacity for domain transfer and safety (knowledge leakage via adapters).\n  - Deepen RAG analysis: retrieval noise vs. hallucination reduction; index freshness, domain drift, latency–accuracy trade-offs; when KG augmentation outperforms unstructured retrieval and why (coverage, schema alignment).\n  - Privacy methods: explicate DP’s epsilon–utility curves, gradient noise impacts on convergence and domain generalization; federated learning’s statistical heterogeneity, communication rounds, and privacy attacks on model updates.\n  - Multimodal alignment: examine loss designs (contrastive vs. generative), information bottlenecks in tokenization of non-text modalities, negative transfer risks, and evaluation pitfalls; discuss alignment assumptions and their limits in telecom data (logs, telemetry, topology graphs).\n  - Compression and safety: connect matrix/activation-aware compression to changes in reasoning, calibration, and bias; reference empirical evidence on compressed-model safety shifts and propose diagnostic procedures.\n- Provide comparative tables or case studies across methods (RAG vs. domain fine-tuning vs. instruction tuning; KG-aug vs. RAG; MoE vs. dense; PEFT families) with explicit assumptions, compute budgets, latency, and accuracy on telecom tasks (spec parsing, PCAP analysis, topology editing).\n- Include failure analyses and ablation-driven insights to move beyond descriptive claims into mechanistic understanding that guides practical choices in telecom deployments.", "4\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey identifies research gaps and future work across data, methodology, evaluation, and ethics in a comprehensive manner, but the depth of analysis on the impact and background of each gap is uneven and often brief. The gaps are distributed throughout sections rather than consolidated into a single Gap/Future Work section, and while many challenges are named with some rationale, the discussion rarely probes deeply into consequences or provides prioritized, concrete research questions.\n\nSupporting parts:\n- Architectural gaps and their impact\n  - Section 2.1: “Emerging research indicates that telecommunications-specific transformer architectures must address several key challenges: domain-specific knowledge representation, multi-modal data integration, computational efficiency, and robust generalization.” It also explains why: “The architectural design must balance model complexity with interpretability, ensuring that sophisticated neural networks remain comprehensible and trustworthy for critical infrastructure applications.”\n  - This both identifies key method-oriented gaps and ties them to telecom-critical trust and interpretability, showing impact.\n\n- Data/corpus construction gaps\n  - Section 3.1: “The corpus construction process must address several critical challenges, including data privacy, representation bias, and computational efficiency.” Followed by a clear future work list: “Future research trajectories... should focus on: 1. Dynamic corpus updating mechanisms 2. Cross-domain knowledge transfer techniques 3. Advanced multi-modal integration strategies 4. Ethical and privacy-preserving data curation 5. Computational efficiency optimization.”\n  - This covers data-centric gaps comprehensively and motivates them by emphasizing domain-specificity and the limitations of generic pretraining (“...addresses fundamental limitations in generic pre-training approaches...”).\n\n- Retrieval-augmented integration limitations\n  - Section 3.2: Identifies method-level gaps explicitly: “Issues of retrieval noise, contextual relevance, and computational efficiency...” and suggests benchmarks to address them: “Innovative solutions like [34] propose comprehensive benchmarking frameworks...”\n  - The impact is implied (precision and verifiability in telecom specs) but not deeply analyzed.\n\n- Privacy-preserving training gaps\n  - Section 3.3: Mentions future directions and needs: “Future research must focus on developing comprehensive frameworks that balance model performance, computational efficiency, and stringent privacy constraints,” and calls for “standardized privacy evaluation metrics” and “adaptive privacy-preservation strategies.”\n  - The importance is noted (sensitive domains and confidentiality), but the discussion is high-level rather than deeply analytical.\n\n- Adaptive knowledge representation and compression gaps\n  - Section 3.4: Identifies open challenges: “Challenges remain in creating universal adaptive representation techniques that can generalize across linguistic and contextual domains.” Also provides concrete future directions (e.g., “Designing self-optimizing models with adaptable internal representations”).\n  - The paper briefly connects these to performance and efficiency (e.g., “the intrinsic connection between data compression ratio and model performance”), but the impact analysis is modest.\n\n- Multimodal integration gaps\n  - Section 3.5: “The field faces substantial challenges, including maintaining semantic consistency across modalities, managing computational complexity, and developing standardized evaluation frameworks.” It also points to future work in robust alignment and generalization.\n  - The rationale (semantic gaps, heterogeneity) is described; however, the potential consequences (e.g., failure modes in telecom operations) are not deeply explored.\n\n- Security and networking gaps\n  - Section 5.1: “Critical challenges persist... including computational complexity, model interpretability, and generalizability across diverse network environments.” This ties directly to threat detection reliability, but the impact discussion remains brief.\n  - Section 5.2: Notes generalization and interpretability challenges and suggests “specialized telecom-domain foundation models” as a solution.\n  - Sections 5.3–5.4 identify gaps in interpretability, efficiency, lifelong learning, and evaluation, but again the analysis is more enumerative than deeply diagnostic.\n\n- Ethics, bias, transparency, and evaluation gaps\n  - Section 6.2: Bias detection and mitigation are framed comprehensively; mentions “multi-pronged interventions” and techniques, linking to ethical impact but without deep case analyses.\n  - Section 6.3: Calls for “more sophisticated evaluation frameworks” and discusses knowledge graph integration to improve transparency; impact on accountability is noted but high level.\n  - Section 6.4: Highlights that compression can change model behavior (“can inadvertently introduce unexpected behavioral shifts”) and calls for governance and standardized assessment—good identification of an important, subtle gap, though the downstream impact is only briefly sketched.\n  - Section 6.5: “Emerging challenges include developing standardized evaluation frameworks for assessing the reliability and ethical performance...” and emphasizes multimodal accountability and privacy needs. The societal impact is acknowledged, but detailed consequences for telecom operations are limited.\n\n- Future perspectives\n  - Section 7.1–7.5: These sections synthesize forward-looking trajectories (convergence, interdisciplinary frontiers, advanced generative technologies, ethical development, societal transformation). They point to needs for specialized LLMs, multimodal models, efficiency, and governance. However, they function more as broad direction setting than deep gap analyses, with limited discussion of the impact of not addressing these gaps or prioritized research roadmaps.\n\nOverall judgment:\n- Strengths: The review thoroughly canvasses gaps across data (domain-specific corpora, privacy), methods (architectures, PEFT, compression, multimodal alignment, RAG), evaluation (benchmarks for multimodal and telecom-specific retrieval), and ethics (bias, transparency, governance). It occasionally ties gaps to telecom-critical impacts (trustworthiness for critical infrastructure, privacy/confidentiality, security resilience).\n- Limitations: The analysis is often brief and distributed across sections without an integrated, prioritized Gap/Future Work synthesis. Many gaps are stated as lists of challenges or future work bullets without deep exploration of why they persist, the specific mechanisms causing them, or quantified impact on the field if left unresolved.\n\nHence, a score of 4 reflects comprehensive identification with somewhat brief analysis and impact discussion.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey presents multiple forward-looking research directions that are clearly tied to known gaps and real-world needs in telecommunications, but the analysis of their potential impact and the causal linkage to specific gaps is sometimes broad rather than deeply elaborated. Overall, the paper proposes innovative topics and concrete suggestions across sections, with especially actionable lists in several subsections, yet it does not consistently provide detailed, step-by-step pathways or rigorous impact analyses for each direction.\n\nEvidence supporting the score:\n- Clear identification of actionable future work grounded in real-world telecom needs:\n  - Section 3.1 Domain-Specific Corpus Construction explicitly lists five concrete future trajectories: “Dynamic corpus updating mechanisms,” “Cross-domain knowledge transfer techniques,” “Advanced multi-modal integration strategies,” “Ethical and privacy-preserving data curation,” and “Computational efficiency optimization.” These directly respond to real challenges in telecom data scarcity, privacy constraints, and multimodality.\n  - Section 3.2 Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge Integration proposes specific future directions: “developing domain-specific embedding spaces,” “incorporating dynamic knowledge update strategies,” and “creating more sophisticated semantic matching algorithms,” aligning with the practical need to parse complex standards (e.g., 3GPP) and operational manuals.\n  - Section 2.3 Computational Efficiency and Model Compression Techniques concludes with a forward-looking, actionable direction: “developing adaptive compression techniques that can dynamically adjust model complexity based on specific task requirements,” which addresses deployment constraints in telecom environments (latency, energy, edge devices).\n  - Section 2.4 Multimodal Integration and Cross-Domain Knowledge Fusion calls out concrete architectural ideas—“adaptive attention mechanisms, modular knowledge representation strategies, and meta-learning frameworks”—that map to real multimodal operations (topology images, logs, specs).\n  - Section 2.5 Robust and Secure Model Design Principles offers specific approaches such as “integration of external knowledge graphs” to reduce hallucinations and “comprehensive multimodal evaluation frameworks,” directly tackling trustworthiness and robustness needs in critical infrastructure.\n  - Section 6.4 Ethical Governance and Responsible Innovation enumerates a detailed governance agenda: “Developing standardized ethical assessment protocols,” “Creating adaptive bias mitigation strategies,” “Establishing comprehensive model monitoring mechanisms,” “Promoting interdisciplinary collaboration,” and “Ensuring continuous learning and improvement of ethical guidelines.” This is both actionable and aligned with regulatory and operational demands in telecom.\n- Strong, forward-looking coverage in Section 7 Future Perspectives and Emerging Research Trajectories:\n  - 7.1 Convergence of AI and Next-Generation Communication Infrastructures points to practical, near-term needs like “zero-touch management paradigms,” “interpret high-level network intents and automatically generate precise configurations,” and “seamlessly integrate across heterogeneous network environments,” which directly address operational automation and OPEX reduction in telecom.\n  - 7.2 Interdisciplinary Research Frontiers identifies concrete methodological gaps and directions: “designing effective pre-training tasks,” “embedding heterogeneous time series,” and “enabling human-understandable interactions,” plus efficiency directions such as “attention offloading.” These map to cross-domain integration challenges (wireless, networking, AI).\n  - 7.3 Advanced Predictive and Generative Technologies offers specific research lines: “reprogramming LLMs for time series forecasting” and “activating LLM capabilities in domain-specific prediction tasks,” alongside “knowledge fusion and editing” and “modality-specific expert networks,” all of which are innovative and meet practical needs (fault prediction, demand forecasting, risk scoring).\n  - 7.4 Ethical and Responsible AI Development provides a prioritized list of five research areas (e.g., “transparent and interpretable compression methodologies,” “robust multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks,” “energy-efficient model architectures”), linking to real constraints (safety, cost, sustainability) and recognized gaps (compression effects on behavior).\n  - 7.5 Societal and Economic Transformation acknowledges workforce and access issues and proposes directions like “resource-efficient architectures that democratize access” and “human-machine collaboration,” addressing real economic and societal needs beyond purely technical gaps.\n\nWhere the analysis is somewhat shallow and broad (reason for not assigning 5):\n- Several future directions are stated at a high level without deep causal analysis of the underlying gap or a detailed plan for achieving impact. Examples include:\n  - 7.2: “Future interdisciplinary research must focus on developing more adaptable, context-aware models…” (broad aspiration without concrete milestones or evaluation plans).\n  - 7.3: “Future research must focus on addressing critical challenges such as knowledge hallucination… and developing more robust multimodal reasoning capabilities.” This identifies important goals but does not delineate specific protocols, datasets, or methodologies to achieve them.\n  - 7.1 and 7.3 highlight promising avenues (e.g., domain-specific LLMs, unified multimodal processing), yet they stop short of providing clear, actionable roadmaps or quantifying anticipated academic/practical impact (e.g., reduction in MTTR, energy savings, accuracy boosts on named benchmarks).\n- The links between earlier-identified challenges and the proposed directions, while present, are not always explicitly traced. For instance, earlier mentions of “model interpretability, domain-specific knowledge adaptation, computational efficiency, and ethical deployment” (Section 1) are broadly addressed later, but the paper could more directly tie each proposed direction to a specific deficiency and quantify expected outcomes.\n\nOverall judgment:\n- The paper excels in breadth, originality, and alignment with real-world telecom needs, and it presents multiple concrete, actionable suggestions (especially in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 6.4, and 7.1–7.5).\n- The discussion of academic and practical impact is present but often brief; the causal analysis of gaps and detailed, actionable paths (with metrics, datasets, baselines) is not consistently thorough across all directions.\n- Hence, a 4-point score appropriately reflects strong prospectiveness with room for deeper, more granular analysis and clearer action plans."]}

{"name": "f2", "paperour": [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4], "reason": ["Score: 4/5\n\nExplanation:\n- Research Objective Clarity: The paper’s objective—to provide “a comprehensive survey” of LLMs for telecommunications—is clear from the title and reinforced in Section 1 Introduction. The Introduction explicitly delineates the survey’s organizing pillars: “The core principles of LLMs in telecommunications revolve around three key aspects: architecture, pre-training, and fine-tuning,” and it sets expectations for coverage of deployment, ethical issues, and future directions (“Emerging trends highlight the convergence of LLMs with next-generation networks, such as 6G and semantic communication… Federated learning and edge-compatible models… Yet, ethical considerations…”). It also closes with a clear statement of intent and scope: “The synthesis of historical advancements, technical innovations, and emerging applications presented here lays the groundwork for subsequent discussions on foundational architectures and key techniques in this survey.” These passages collectively make the objective sufficiently specific for a survey article and aligned with core field issues (real-time processing, scalability, domain-specific language understanding).\n- Background and Motivation: The Introduction provides a strong contextual grounding. It traces the historical evolution from transformer-based general-purpose LLMs (e.g., GPT/BERT) to telecom-centric adaptations (“Historically, LLMs emerged from advancements in transformer architectures… adapted to telecom-specific applications, such as network diagnostics and customer service automation”), and articulates clear domain demands driving this evolution (“unique demands of telecommunications, including real-time processing, scalability, and the need for domain-specific language understanding”). It further motivates the work by identifying pressing challenges (“real-time processing constraints and the need for robust domain-specific language understanding”) and specifying telecom-specific data characteristics (network logs, 3GPP standards, customer transcripts).\n- Practical Significance and Guidance Value: The Introduction demonstrates strong practical relevance. It highlights key application areas (“Automation of network management… multilingual customer support and sentiment analysis”) and ties them to enabling techniques (MoE, LoRA, RLHF, RAG, federated learning), while also foregrounding constraints and trade-offs (“trade-offs between model performance and resource efficiency… ethical considerations, including bias mitigation and regulatory compliance”). The forward-looking orientation (“Future research must bridge gaps in scalability, real-time processing, and interdisciplinary collaboration”) provides actionable guidance for researchers and practitioners, indicating where further work is needed.\n\nReasons for not awarding 5/5:\n- The Abstract is missing from the provided text. For a survey, a concise Abstract that lays out the objective, scope, taxonomy, and main contributions is important to maximize clarity.\n- The Introduction, while comprehensive, does not explicitly enumerate research questions, contributions, or a formal taxonomy statement (e.g., “This survey contributes: (1)… (2)… (3)…”). Such an explicit contributions paragraph would strengthen objective clarity and guidance value.\n- Scope boundaries (what is out of scope) and methodological stance (e.g., how studies were selected, evaluation criteria for inclusion) are not described in the Introduction, which slightly reduces the precision of the research direction.\n\nOverall, the Introduction clearly states the survey’s purpose, provides substantial background and motivation, and articulates strong practical significance, but the absence of an Abstract and a formalized contributions/objectives paragraph keeps the score at 4 rather than 5.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey presents a relatively clear and coherent classification of methods and a reasonable depiction of their evolution, though some connections and stages could be more explicitly unified.\n\n- Method Classification Clarity\n  - The paper establishes a clear foundational taxonomy early on: “The core principles of LLMs in telecommunications revolve around three key aspects: architecture, pre-training, and fine-tuning” (Section 1 Introduction). This anchors the methodological structure.\n  - Section 2 (“Foundational Architectures and Training Paradigms”) systematically elaborates these pillars:\n    - 2.1 (Transformer-Based Architectures) classifies architectural methods (sparse/MoE designs, dynamic attention, lightweight variants, retrieval-augmented and neuro-symbolic hybrids).\n    - 2.2 (Telecom-Specific Pre-Training) covers tokenization/embedding, multimodal pre-training, self-supervised objectives—clearly scoped to telecom data characteristics.\n    - 2.3 (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) differentiates LoRA, RLHF, prompt tuning/adapters, and their trade-offs for telecom tasks.\n    - 2.4 (Scalability and Deployment) distinguishes distributed inference, energy efficiency, orchestration, multi-adapter serving—mapping to real-world telecom constraints.\n    - 2.5 (Emerging Architectures and Hybrid Approaches) frames RAG, MM-LLMs, neuro-symbolic systems, federated and edge-compatible designs as hybrid solutions.\n  - The “Key Techniques for Telecom-Specific Applications” in Section 3 further classifies method families by application: NLP automation (3.1), configuration and optimization (3.2), security (3.3), multimodal integration (3.4), performance optimization and scalability (3.5), and hybrid approaches (3.6). Each subsection is scoped and names concrete techniques (e.g., in 3.1: RAG, multilingual adapters; in 3.2: intent-based configuration; in 3.3: adversarial robustness, federated security; in 3.4: cross-modal fusion, QA-LoRA; in 3.5: speculative decoding, model parallelism).\n  - The classification is reinforced in Sections 4–5 by mapping methods to applications and evaluation/benchmarking, showing how techniques are deployed and assessed in telecom scenarios.\n\n- Evolution of Methodology\n  - The narrative explicitly signals progression between method stages:\n    - From general LLMs to telecom-centric adaptations (Introduction: “transition from general NLP to telecom-centric LLMs involves specialized pre-training…”).\n    - From architectures to efficiency and deployment (2.4: “a natural progression from the parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods discussed earlier” and “foreshadowing the multimodal and retrieval-augmented techniques…”).\n    - From foundational methods to hybrids (2.5: “Three key approaches—retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), multimodal LLMs (MM-LLMs), and neuro-symbolic integration—are reshaping LLM deployment…”).\n    - From NLP to optimization and security (3.2: “building upon their demonstrated capabilities in telecom-specific NLP tasks”; 3.3 references multimodal and self-supervised objectives discussed earlier).\n    - Across sections, connective phrases (“seamlessly transitioning,” “natural progression,” “foreshadowing,” “building upon”) consistently guide the reader through the methodological evolution.\n  - Future-oriented evolution is laid out in Section 7 (Future Directions): integration with next-generation networks and semantic communication (7.1), privacy-preserving and federated paradigms (7.2), multimodal/cross-domain LLMs (7.3), scalability and efficiency (7.4), regulatory/ethical frameworks (7.5), and emerging research directions (7.6). These subsections tie back to earlier methods and explicitly identify trends and open problems.\n  - The survey also embeds trade-offs and transitions (e.g., 2.1 on sparse/MoE vs. load balancing; 2.3 on LoRA vs. nonlinear patterns; 3.5 on speculative decoding and distributed inference; 4.5 on energy-latency trade-offs), indicating how method choices evolved to meet telecom constraints.\n\n- Areas for Improvement (why not 5)\n  - Taxonomy overlap and fragmentation: Hybrid architectures/methods appear repeatedly across 2.5 and 3.6; performance optimization spans both 2.4 and 3.5; security methods are covered in 3.3 and revisited in 4.3. While context differs, a consolidated taxonomy or figure mapping layers (architecture → training → adaptation → deployment → hybrid → application) would strengthen coherence.\n  - Evolution staging is implicit rather than explicitly chronological. The paper signals transitions but does not provide a clear timeline or phased development (e.g., early dense transformers → sparse/MoE → PEFT → hybrid RAG/neuro-symbolic → multimodal/federated) with milestones tied to telecom adoption.\n  - Some cross-references are rhetorical (“foreshadowing,” “bridging”) rather than analytical, and certain evolutionary connections (e.g., how benchmarks in 5 catalyze method shifts in 2–3) could be more thoroughly synthesized.\n\nOverall, the paper reflects the technological development of LLMs in telecom with a structured and connected classification and a reasonably systematic evolution narrative, but it falls short of a fully unified taxonomy and explicit evolution stages. Hence, 4 points.", "Score: 3/5\n\nExplanation:\n- Diversity of datasets: The survey mentions a few telecom-specific benchmarks but provides limited breadth and detail. In Section 5.1, it references “datasets like [90]” (TSpec-LLM) and highlights “TeleQnA” [26] as enabling reproducible evaluation of 3GPP understanding and telecom knowledge. These appear repeatedly (e.g., Section 3.3 references “TelecomQnA benchmark datasets [26]”; Section 5.3 notes “<2% drop in TeleQnA benchmarks [26]”). Beyond these, most data sources are described generically (e.g., “3GPP standards, network logs, customer service transcripts” in Sections 1 and 2.2) rather than as curated datasets with stated properties. Frameworks such as LMMs-Eval [146], RouterBench [128], and Vidur [126] are cited as evaluation or simulation tools (Section 5.5), but the survey does not provide a wider catalog of telecom datasets (e.g., public intrusion detection corpora, labeled trouble-ticket sets, annotated multimodal logs) with scope or composition details.\n- Detail and rationale on datasets are minimal: The paper does not describe dataset scale, labeling protocols, splits, or languages. For example, in Section 4.4 the claim that “[90] provides a benchmark dataset that enables LLMs to answer technical queries with 71–75% accuracy when augmented with RAG” does not include dataset size, annotation method, or task breakdown. Similarly, while [104] and [26] are cited for document categorization and telecom QA, there is no discussion of how these datasets were constructed or balanced (Section 4.4; Section 5.1).\n- Diversity and rationality of metrics: The survey does a better job here, covering metrics that are both academically common and operationally meaningful for telecom:\n  - Latency and throughput for real-time systems (Section 3.5: “time-to-first-token (TTFT) and tokens-per-second (TPS)”; Section 4.5 discusses latency reduction; Section 5.1 integrates latency constraints into fault detection evaluation).\n  - Energy efficiency (Section 3.5: “joules per token”; Section 5.2 roofline analysis and memory-bound inference; Section 5.5 sustainability-aware metrics; Section 6.1 quantifies carbon footprint concerns).\n  - Task-specific accuracy metrics (Section 5.1: precision-recall for diagnostics; Section 4.2: BLEU-4 for speech-to-text translation; Section 4.2: sentiment F1-scores; Section 4.3: precision in intrusion detection).\n  - Robustness and security metrics (Section 5.1: “False Positive Rate Under Attack (FPRA)” for adversarial robustness; Section 5.3: stress testing under load and adversarial settings).\n  - Time-series evaluation (Section 5.1: “Mean Absolute Scaled Error” for forecasting).\n  - RAG evaluation (Section 5.1 and 5.5 discuss retrieval-augmented protocols and hallucination rates).\n  These choices are largely appropriate and tied to telecom constraints (e.g., URLLC-like latency, QoS compliance in Section 4.5).\n- Missing metric definitions and depth: While many metrics are named, the survey rarely defines them or explains how they are applied per task. For example, FPRA (Section 5.1) is introduced without formal definition or examples; QoS compliance (Section 4.5) is cited as “15–25% better” without specifying which QoS indicators (latency, jitter, packet loss) or how measured; energy metrics are mentioned but not standardized across scenarios. Section 5.1 acknowledges gaps explicitly: “lack of unified metrics for cross-modal tasks,” “insufficient attention to energy efficiency during inference,” and “limited benchmarks for continual learning scenarios,” which supports the assessment that metric coverage is acknowledged but not fully systematized.\n- Practical linkage between metrics and tasks: There is clear effort to tie metrics to real-world telecom requirements (e.g., TTFT/TPS for diagnostics in Section 3.5; latency constraints in Sections 4.5 and 5.1; adversarial robustness for security in Sections 4.3 and 5.3). This strengthens rationality, even if execution detail is thin.\n- Overall judgment: The survey’s metric coverage is broad and largely reasonable for telecom contexts, but dataset coverage is narrow and lacks critical detail (scale, labeling, splits, multilingual aspects). The paper often cites benchmarks (TeleQnA [26], TSpec-LLM [90]) and evaluation frameworks but does not comprehensively catalog datasets nor provide detailed descriptions that would meet the 5-point standard. The acknowledgment of benchmarking gaps (Section 5.1; Section 5.5) further indicates that the dataset/metric landscape is only partially covered. Therefore, a 3/5 reflects limited dataset diversity and detail, with stronger—though still not exhaustive—metric coverage and reasonable alignment to telecom tasks.", "Score: 4/5\n\nExplanation:\nThe review provides a clear and largely systematic comparison of methods across the core dimensions relevant to telecom LLMs—architecture, pre-training, fine-tuning, deployment, and hybridization—while identifying advantages, disadvantages, and trade-offs with good technical grounding. However, it falls short of a fully systematic cross-method synthesis (e.g., no unifying taxonomy or side-by-side criteria applied consistently to all methods), and some subsections remain narrative rather than comparative.\n\nStrengths in clarity, rigor, and depth:\n- Explains architectural distinctions and trade-offs with concrete metrics and constraints:\n  - Section 2.1 contrasts dense transformers with sparse/MoE designs (“activate only subsets of model parameters per input”), quantifying benefits (“reducing inference latency by 30–50%”) and acknowledging drawbacks (“challenges in load balancing across experts”), and names mitigation strategies (“gradient-guided gating or WDMoE-based distributed inference”).\n  - It further distinguishes dynamic attention mechanisms (“prune 60–80% of computations without accuracy loss”) and formalizes temporal/spatial locality biases with an attention equation—indicating rigor in articulating how architectural assumptions differ.\n  - It evaluates lightweight variants and compression (“4-bit precision with <1% accuracy drop,” “aggressive pruning … harms compositional reasoning”), explicitly articulating trade-offs between latency/efficiency and reasoning capacity.\n  - Hybrid models are differentiated by function (“RAG … grounds LLM outputs in 3GPP standards, reducing hallucination rates by 40%,” vs. “neuro-symbolic … rule-based validators for interpretable network diagnostics”), clearly stating advantages and intended use cases.\n- Contrasts pre-training strategies along data and objective axes:\n  - Section 2.2 separates tokenization/embedding (“hybrid approaches combining rule-based segmentation with learned embeddings”) from multimodal pre-training (“15–20% accuracy” improvement) and specialized self-supervised objectives (“masked network event prediction,” “contrastive learning for protocol alignment”), highlighting their domain fit and data efficiency (“reducing fine-tuning data requirements by 40%”).\n  - Challenges are identified and specific (“synthetic data generation … risks bias,” “6-bit quantization preserves performance”), mapping techniques to limitations.\n- Compares PEFT techniques by mechanism, assumptions, and resource/performance trade-offs:\n  - Section 2.3 contrasts LoRA (“only 0.1% of the parameters updated,” but “may limit … nonlinear patterns”), RLHF (“reducing manual validation efforts by 40%,” but “resource-intensive”), and prompt/adapters (“90% of full fine-tuning performance with just 2% additional parameters,” but “prompt sensitivity”), explicitly naming pros/cons and operational implications.\n  - It also notes compositional hybrids (LoRA + RLHF; PEFT + RAG), clarifying when combinations mitigate single-method limitations.\n- Deployment/scalability comparisons are practical and multi-dimensional:\n  - Section 2.4 contrasts distributed inference approaches (“WDMoE … partitions workloads across edge and cloud,” “InfMoE … sparse activation on single GPUs”) with energy-oriented methods (“dynamic batching and gradient checkpointing reduce power consumption by up to 40%,” “QA-LoRA … INT4 with <1% accuracy loss”).\n  - It flags system-level trade-offs (“adapter switching latency … mitigated through predictive loading”) and compares sparse fine-tuning vs. full-tuning performance regimes (“SpIEL … slower in low-data scenarios but outperform[s] LoRA by 12% when data exceeds 10k samples”), demonstrating nuanced, data-dependent evaluation.\n- Hybrid approaches are contrasted by capability and cost:\n  - Section 2.5 distinguishes RAG (“latency overheads from retrieval operations”), multimodal LLMs (“alignment challenges across heterogeneous data modalities”), and neuro-symbolic integration (“reduces manual configuration errors by 30%”), explaining how these methods differ in architecture, objectives (grounding vs. fusion vs. rule compliance), and assumptions about knowledge access and interpretability.\n\nWhere the comparison falls short of a perfect score:\n- While each subsection offers clear contrasts and trade-offs, there is no overarching comparative framework or taxonomy applied uniformly across methods (e.g., a consistent set of axes such as latency, accuracy, interpretability, data dependence, energy, and deployment footprint). The comparisons are thorough within subsections but not synthesized into a single, structured set of dimensions spanning all techniques.\n- Some areas remain more descriptive than comparative. For example:\n  - Section 2.2 lists multiple pre-training techniques and benefits but provides less direct, method-vs-method contrast on when to prefer masked event prediction vs. contrastive alignment beyond general statements (e.g., “These objectives enable few-shot adaptation, reducing fine-tuning data requirements by 40%,” and “risks bias” in synthetic data).\n  - Section 2.5 mentions “hybrid RAG architectures … combining dense and sparse retrievers” and “modality-specific experts” but does not deeply analyze selection criteria or boundary conditions (e.g., retrieval latency vs. accuracy curves, or when neuro-symbolic validation measurably outperforms pure RAG).\n- Cross-cutting comparisons (e.g., LoRA vs. adapters vs. pruning vs. quantization vs. MoE under identical telecom tasks and constraints) are implied across sections but not consolidated, which would elevate the analysis from strong narrative comparison to a systematic evaluation.\n\nOverall, the review demonstrates strong, technically grounded comparisons with explicit advantages, disadvantages, assumptions, and use-case alignment, especially in Sections 2.1, 2.3, and 2.4. It would reach a 5/5 with a unifying comparative schema applied across all methods and deeper, side-by-side analysis in areas like pre-training objectives and hybrid architectures beyond narrative contrasts.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\n\nOverall, the survey delivers meaningful, technically grounded critical analysis across core method families (architectures, pre-training, PEFT, deployment) and maps those choices to telecom-specific constraints (latency, edge resources, compliance). It goes beyond description by articulating trade-offs, limitations, and cross-cutting synergies. However, the depth is uneven: in several places, claims are insightful but not unpacked to the level of underlying mechanisms or explicit assumptions, and some comparative statements lack causal analysis. Below are specific strengths and gaps tied to concrete sections and sentences.\n\nWhere the paper provides strong, well-reasoned analysis\n\n- Section 2.1 (Transformer-Based Architectures)\n  - Explains efficiency-performance mechanisms and design trade-offs: “MoE architectures achieve linear computational cost reduction… However, these designs introduce challenges in load balancing across experts… necessitating techniques like gradient-guided gating” and “Dynamic attention mechanisms… prune 60–80% of computations without accuracy loss… temporal-spatial attention… align[s] with the time-sensitive nature of tasks.” This ties method behavior (sparse routing, locality biases) to telecom constraints (real-time, geo-temporal patterns) and provides a grounded equation for biased attention (A_ij … with φ and ψ).\n  - Notes harmful side-effects with a plausible causal hypothesis: “aggressive pruning of ‘redundant’ layers harms compositional reasoning in network configuration generation” (a nontrivial failure mode often overlooked in purely descriptive surveys).\n  - Synthesizes hybrid approaches to mitigate limitations: “Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)… grounds LLM outputs in 3GPP standards, reducing hallucination rates by 40% in technical documentation tasks,” and “Neuro-symbolic integration… with rule-based validators for interpretable network diagnostics.”\n\n- Section 2.2 (Telecom-Specific Pre-Training)\n  - Links tokenization/embeddings to domain structure: “Hybrid approaches… for protocol headers and signal measurements… hierarchical embeddings… capture temporal and spatial dependencies,” a technical rationale for why generic tokenizers underperform on telecom corpora.\n  - Analyzes objective selection in terms of telecom data properties: “Masked network event prediction… balances accuracy and computational efficiency,” and “Contrastive learning for protocol alignment… enables few-shot adaptation,” tying objectives to downstream data efficiency and alignment.\n  - Explicitly discusses risks and trade-offs: “Synthetic data generation… risks bias,” “quantization-aware pre-training… addresses memory overhead.”\n\n- Section 2.3 (PEFT)\n  - Offers mechanistic commentary: presents LoRA’s low-rank update formula and argues “LoRA’s reliance on linear projections may limit its ability to capture nonlinear telecom-specific patterns,” then contrasts with “LoRA-FA… freezing one of the low-rank matrices,” which is a concrete, technically grounded limitation/remedy pair.\n  - Evaluates RLHF beyond description: “requires carefully curated preference datasets and iterative reward modeling… resource-intensive,” and suggests “combining LoRA with RLHF… fine-tuning only the reward head’s low-rank layers,” an insightful synthesis under telecom compute constraints.\n  - Identifies sensitivity/failure modes: “suboptimal prompts can degrade performance,” pointing to initialization/meta-learning needs.\n\n- Section 2.4 (Scalability and Deployment)\n  - Connects system design to telecom SLAs: “WDMoE… partitions LLM workloads across edge and cloud… aligning with low-latency requirements”; “QA-LoRA… INT4 precision with <1% accuracy loss… on edge devices,” and “adapter switching latency… mitigated through predictive loading,” showing thoughtful reasoning across model, system, and traffic patterns.\n  - Compares sparse fine-tuning behavior under different data regimes: “SpIEL… converge[s] slower… in low-data scenarios but outperform[s] LoRA… when data exceeds 10k samples,” a useful, nuanced observation about data-dependent method selection.\n\n- Section 2.5 (Emerging/Hybrid)\n  - Balances benefit-cost analysis: “RAG… mitigates hallucination… [but] introduces latency… necessitating optimized indexing,” and in MM-LLMs: “alignment challenges across heterogeneous data modalities… leveraging cross-modal attention masks,” both pointing to cause-and-effect and design countermeasures.\n  - Addresses interpretability-design trade-offs: “Neuro-symbolic integration… validated by symbolic reasoners for compliance,” positioning hybrid systems as a principled response to black-box risks.\n\n- Section 3.1 (Telecom NLP)\n  - Identifies core ambiguities and how methods address them: “user queries often contain ambiguities… multi-task RL… optimizing for correctness and coherence,” and “RAG introduces latency… necessitating optimized vector databases and hierarchical indexing,” again connecting method limits to telecom responsiveness requirements.\n  - Notes edge deployment trade-offs: “pruning redundant transformer layers can accelerate inference… [but] over-aggressive pruning harms few-shot learning.”\n\n- Section 3.2 (Network Optimization)\n  - Links temporal reasoning and streaming to algorithm choice: “temporal reasoning challenges… attention mechanisms—enabling stable performance even in infinite sequence lengths,” and articulates MoE routing latency vs. hardware-aware optimizations.\n\n- Section 3.3 (Security)\n  - Moves beyond summary to attack surface and defenses: “prompt injection and data poisoning… mitigation strategies… differential privacy… [but] trade-off… detection sensitivity vs false positives… encrypted traffic,” and quantifies costs: “homomorphic encryption… 3–5× latency overhead.”\n\n- Sections 3.4–3.5 (Multimodality; Optimization)\n  - Provides fusion mechanics and compute constraints: gating-based fusion equation; “dynamic token pruning to reduce redundancy,” “4-bit quantized MM-LLMs… <100ms latency… ~5% drop,” and roofline analysis (“70% of inference latency attributed to memory access”), which is a strong, mechanistic explanation of bottlenecks.\n\n- Strengths in synthesis across research lines\n  - Recurring, well-connected themes: PEFT ↔ RAG ↔ neuro-symbolic integration ↔ federated/edge deployment appear across Sections 2–4, showing the authors recognize that no single method suffices under telecom constraints and offering composite solutions (e.g., LoRA + RLHF; RAG + 3GPP grounding; neuro-symbolic validation for compliance).\n\nWhere the analysis is uneven or underdeveloped\n\n- Limited articulation of underlying causes in places:\n  - Section 2.3: “LoRA’s reliance on linear projections may limit… nonlinear patterns” is plausible but not unpacked (e.g., where nonlinearity matters most in telecom tasks, or empirical signatures of failure in configuration synthesis).\n  - Section 2.5: “MM-LLMs… face alignment challenges” and “Hybrid retrievers… 2–3× faster” state outcomes but do not delve into failure mechanisms (e.g., modality gap, co-training instability, optimizer-induced collapse, or routing conflicts in MoE for mixed modalities).\n  - Section 3.2: “SpIEL… outperform[s] LoRA by 12%… when data exceeds 10k samples” is insightful but lacks explanation (e.g., sparsity structure aligning with richer supervision, or reduced interference vs. dense updates).\n\n- Assumptions and boundary conditions are often implicit:\n  - Real-time claims (URLLC, sub-100ms targets) appear in 3.4, 3.5, 4.5, but the survey rarely quantifies how specific algorithmic choices push latency below critical thresholds (e.g., mapping KV-cache savings, speculative decoding depth, or expert parallelism to end-to-end TTFT/TPS under telecom traffic bursts).\n  - Federated/non-IID effects are mentioned (2.5, 3.5, 6.2, 7.2) but not deeply analyzed (e.g., drift, personalization vs. global optimality, fairness impacts in cross-operator models).\n\n- Some cross-method contrasts stop short of mechanistic commentary:\n  - Semantic communication savings (e.g., 4.6 and 7.1): asserted benefits (“30–50% bandwidth reduction”) but limited causal analysis on where semantic compression holds under noisy channels, misalignment risks, or how RAG/neuro-symbolic components constrain hallucination in control loops.\n  - Robustness in multi-modal security (3.3, 4.3): good identification of attack vectors, but less discussion of root causes inside LLMs (e.g., attention hijacking patterns, instruction-following priors, or gradient alignment that amplifies injections).\n\nWhy this merits a 4 and not a 5\n\n- The paper consistently identifies design trade-offs and ties them to telecom constraints, offering multi-method syntheses and occasionally formalizations (2.1, 3.4). This is substantively beyond descriptive summary.\n- However, in several high-impact areas (federated non-IID learning, MM-LLM alignment mechanics, detailed latency budgets, failure modes in sparse routing and speculative decoding), the analysis remains at a high level. Explanations of fundamental causes are present but uneven, with several claims that would benefit from deeper mechanistic or empirical rationale.\n\nSuggestions to strengthen the critical analysis (research guidance value)\n\n- Make assumptions explicit and tie them to telecom KPIs:\n  - For each method family (MoE, quantization, speculative decoding, RAG), specify latency/throughput/energy budgets and show how design choices map to TTFT/TPS and URLLC targets under realistic load.\n- Deepen causal analysis of known failure modes:\n  - MM-LLM alignment: discuss modality gap, optimization instability, and strategies (e.g., contrastive pretraining schedules, temperature scaling, router regularization) that address them.\n  - Sparse/PEFT vs full tuning: explain when sparse updates underperform (e.g., highly entangled tasks like protocol synthesis) and why data scale or structure reverses the advantage.\n- Analyze federated non-IID effects:\n  - Detail convergence issues, personalization-vs-generalization tensions, and fairness drift across operators; relate to adapter specialization vs. shared base dynamics.\n- Contrast retrieval and closed-book modes with error taxonomies:\n  - Provide a decision framework for when RAG reduces hallucination without violating latency, including cache policies, index refresh strategies, and fallback behaviors under retrieval failure.\n- Connect architectural choices to hardware constraints:\n  - Map KV-cache, attention variants (linear/KV-sinks), and MoE routing to specific accelerator memory hierarchies (HBM/flash), quantifying expected gains and contention under telecom burstiness.\n\nIn summary, the survey demonstrates notable analytical depth and cross-method synthesis in many places (especially Sections 2.1–2.5 and 3.1–3.5), but the depth is inconsistent, with some claims lacking mechanistic underpinnings or explicit boundary conditions. This supports a score of 4 for critical analysis quality.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe review identifies research gaps comprehensively across data, methods, deployment, evaluation, and ethics, and frequently connects them to telecom-specific constraints (latency, energy, privacy, compliance). However, while the coverage is broad, the analysis is often brief and fragmented, with many gaps listed without sustained, deep exploration of their root causes or quantified impact. This aligns with a score of 4: thorough identification but only moderate depth of analysis.\n\nEvidence supporting the score:\n\n- Data and pre-training gaps:\n  - Section 2.2 (Telecom-Specific Pre-Training Strategies), “Challenges and Future Directions”: Identifies “data scarcity and energy efficiency,” risks of synthetic data bias, and calls for “federated pre-training… and neuro-symbolic integration,” tying them to privacy and memory constraints. This shows awareness of data-related gaps, though impact analysis is succinct.\n  - Section 3.4 (Multimodal Data Integration), “Future directions must address… unified evaluation benchmarks,” notes the deficiency of standardized multimodal evaluation in telecom.\n\n- Methodological gaps (architectures, efficiency, PEFT):\n  - Section 2.3 (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning), conclusion: Lists future directions such as “dynamic rank allocation for LoRA, federated RLHF,” but offers limited analysis of why these matter or their potential systemic impact in telecom beyond efficiency.\n  - Section 2.4 (Scalability and Deployment Considerations): “Challenges persist in balancing specialization and generalization… Future directions include adaptive compute-offloading… telecom-specific scaling laws.” This ties methods to deployment constraints and articulates their importance for latency and scaling, though still at a high level.\n  - Section 2.5 (Emerging Architectures and Hybrid Approaches): Notes “challenges in balancing model sparsity and accuracy,” and suggests “adaptive architectures… semantic communication,” connecting method choices to efficiency and accuracy trade-offs.\n\n- Security and robustness gaps:\n  - Section 3.3 (Security and Anomaly Detection): Explicitly states “three critical gaps” including “dynamic adversarial training pipelines,” “lightweight, quantized LLMs… for edge,” and “neuro-symbolic reasoning,” with rationale tied to evolving threats and resource constraints. Impact is mentioned (false positives, latency), but deeper causal or quantitative analysis is limited.\n  - Section 5.3 (Robustness and Scalability Testing): Highlights vulnerabilities such as “prompt injection,” MoE training issues (“multi-epoch degradation”), and the open challenge of “sub-100ms latency,” then proposes directions like neuro-symbolic reasoning and federated collaboration. Good identification; impact discussion is present but brief.\n\n- Evaluation and benchmarking gaps:\n  - Section 5.1 (Standardized Evaluation Frameworks): Clearly articulates gaps: “lack of unified metrics for cross-modal tasks,” “insufficient attention to energy efficiency,” and “limited benchmarks for continual learning.” It explains why these matter (e.g., dynamic network conditions, energy costs), demonstrating telecom-specific evaluation needs.\n  - Section 5.2 (Comparative Analysis): Contrasts LLMs with traditional algorithms, pointing to robustness and energy-efficiency deficits (e.g., “1.58-bit quantized LLMs… trail optimized C++ implementations… in TOPS/Watt”), and highlighting practical deployment implications.\n\n- Ethical, fairness, regulatory gaps:\n  - Section 5.4 (Ethical and Fairness Considerations): Identifies “dynamic fairness adaptation,” “energy-efficient auditing,” and “cross-border harmonization,” and explains impacts (e.g., multilingual disparities, auditability constraints). The analysis is more thematic than deeply diagnostic.\n  - Section 6.2 (Data Privacy and Security Risks): Frames trade-offs in federated learning and differential privacy and connects them to telecom’s latency and accuracy needs; proposes hybrid solutions (federated fine-tuning with LoRA), yet does not deeply quantify impacts.\n  - Section 6.4 (Regulatory and Interoperability Challenges): Enumerates future directions (standardized APIs/benchmarks, privacy-preserving training, dynamic compliance engines), linking them to real-time constraints and multi-stakeholder needs.\n\n- Future directions synthesizing gaps:\n  - Section 7.1 (Integration with Next-Generation Networks): Ties gaps to 6G needs (“quadratic complexity of transformer attention,” “ethical risks, including bias”), with impacts on URLLC and semantic communication; analysis is clear but high level.\n  - Section 7.2 (Privacy-Preserving and Federated Learning): Lists “three key challenges” (non-IID distributions, secure aggregation latency, continual updates) and proposes method-level solutions; reasons are sound, impact is suggested but not deeply explored.\n  - Section 7.3 (Multimodal and Cross-Domain LLM Applications): Identifies “scalability and modality imbalance” and bias in multimodal datasets; connects to telecom tasks (QoS, anomaly detection); impact discussion is concise.\n  - Section 7.4 (Scalability and Efficiency Challenges): Addresses trade-offs (model size, energy, latency), references QA-LoRA, WDMoE, and LoRAX; articulates importance for edge deployments and sustainable operations.\n\nWhy this is not a 5:\n- Fragmentation and brevity: Many “Challenges/Future directions” subsections list gaps but do not consistently provide deep causal analysis or quantify impacts (e.g., how specific gaps affect KPIs like TTFT, TPS, QoS, or regulatory non-compliance rates).\n- Limited synthesis: While gaps are covered across sections, there is limited integrative framing that prioritizes gaps or maps them to a coherent research agenda with clear impact pathways.\n- Occasional generality: Some future work items (e.g., “neuro-symbolic integration,” “adaptive architectures”) recur without detailed justification tailored to telecom subdomains.\n\nOverall, the review excels at identifying a wide range of relevant gaps and connecting them to telecom constraints, but the analysis tends to remain at a broad level rather than offering deep, prioritized, and impact-focused exploration. Hence, a score of 4 is appropriate.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe paper proposes numerous forward-looking research directions that are well grounded in identified gaps and real-world telecom needs, and it offers several specific, innovative topics and suggestions. However, while the directions are relevant and often actionable, the analysis of academic and practical impact is generally brief and dispersed, without consistently deep exploration of the causes or implications of the gaps. This aligns best with the 4-point criterion.\n\nEvidence from specific sections and sentences:\n\nStrengths: Clear identification of gaps tied to real-world constraints and actionable future directions\n- 2.4 Scalability and Deployment Considerations explicitly connects deployment constraints to telecom realities and proposes concrete solutions: “Future directions include adaptive compute-offloading, where LLM submodules are dynamically partitioned between edge and cloud based on network congestion, and the development of telecom-specific scaling laws to optimize model size for downstream tasks [50].” This is both forward-looking and directly responsive to low-latency, resource-constrained environments.\n- 3.4 Multimodal Data Integration identifies domain-specific gaps and offers targeted directions: “Future directions must address three unresolved challenges… (1) Dynamic modality weighting… (2) Federated multimodal learning… (3) Unified evaluation benchmarks [26].” These address multimodal alignment and privacy needs in real telecom operations.\n- 5.5 Emerging Trends and Future Directions in Benchmarking frames evaluation needs around federated and efficiency-centric benchmarking for telecom workloads: “Future directions must address three key challenges: (1) Standardization… (2) Dynamic adaptation… (3) Generalization.” This is closely aligned with operational needs and reproducibility.\n- 6.4 Regulatory and Interoperability Challenges proposes actionable priorities that map directly to real-world compliance barriers: “Three research priorities stand out: 1) Standardized APIs and Benchmarks… 2) Privacy-Preserving Training… 3) Dynamic Compliance Engines…”\n- 7.2 Privacy-Preserving and Federated Learning Paradigms outlines specific, technically novel directions: “Future directions should explore: (1) lightweight homomorphic encryption for transformer attention layers… (2) cross-silo FL architectures… (3) federated reinforcement learning…,” which directly serve GDPR and data sovereignty constraints in telecom.\n- 7.4 Scalability and Efficiency Challenges shows clear actionability for deployment: “Future research must address unresolved challenges, including the scalability of federated learning… development of lightweight, multimodal LLMs for edge deployment… innovations in adaptive resource allocation, such as LLM-driven dynamic batching…”\n- 7.5 Regulatory and Ethical Frameworks identifies operationally relevant future research: “Future research must address three critical gaps: (1) developing lightweight, real-time bias detection tools… (2) standardizing cross-border regulatory sandboxes… (3) advancing energy-efficient adversarial robustness techniques…” These are practical, measurable, and aligned with telecom policy and compliance needs.\n- 7.6 Emerging Research Directions articulates higher-level strategic tensions and pathways: “Future research must reconcile three tensions: autonomy versus determinism, evaluation breadth versus practicality, and multimodal richness versus efficiency,” and suggests concrete next steps like “neuro-symbolic integration… federated benchmarking initiatives… advances in sparsity-aware training.”\n\nInnovation and specificity:\n- The survey consistently proposes advanced, specific directions such as “telecom-specific scaling laws” (2.4), “dynamic modality weighting” (3.4), “federated RLHF” (2.3, implied by “federated RLHF for privacy-preserving alignment”), “MatMul-free models” for real-time constraints (3.2: “innovations like [68] propose eliminating matrix multiplications entirely”), and “semantic communication” leveraging LLMs to transmit meaning, reducing bandwidth (3.6; 7.1).\n- It offers implementable ideas like standardized telecom benchmarks (TeleQnA [26], TSpec-LLM [90]), “Dynamic compliance engines” (6.4), “adaptive compute-offloading” (2.4), “lightweight homomorphic encryption for attention” (7.2), and “LLM-driven dynamic batching” (7.4).\n\nLinkage to real-world needs:\n- Multiple sections explicitly anchor directions to telecom constraints: URLLC latency and mMTC in 6G (7.1), GDPR/data sovereignty (6.2; 7.2), edge resource constraints (2.1; 2.4; 7.4), and standard-compliant outputs via RAG with 3GPP (2.5; 3.6; 4.4; 5.1; 7.5).\n- Examples of quantified impacts that show practical relevance, though not always in future directions, appear in earlier sections and inform the proposed directions (e.g., “30% bandwidth savings” via semantic communication [3.6], “sub-100ms decision cycles” for 6G [4.5], and “<100ms latency” for multimodal models at edge [3.4]).\n\nLimitations preventing a 5-point score:\n- The analysis of academic vs practical impact is often concise and not deeply elaborated. For example, while 7.2 proposes “lightweight homomorphic encryption for transformer attention layers,” it does not discuss feasibility trade-offs (compute overhead vs privacy guarantees) in depth.\n- Several future directions are presented as lists of promising avenues without full exploration of the underlying causes of the gaps or step-by-step pathways to resolution. For instance, 7.3’s “dynamic adaptation and federated learning” recommendations and 7.6’s tensions could benefit from more detailed methodological blueprints or evaluation protocols.\n- Some directions remain broad or high-level (e.g., 7.1’s “address scalability bottlenecks… ethical risks…”; 7.6’s “interdisciplinary collaboration”) and lack the “clear and actionable path” detail required for a 5-point rating across the entire future work scope.\n\nOverall, the survey excels in identifying and proposing forward-looking, innovative directions that address genuine telecom needs and constraints across privacy, latency, scalability, multimodality, and compliance. It falls short of a perfect score primarily due to the relative brevity of impact analyses and limited depth on implementation pathways for some proposed directions."]}

{"name": "x1", "paperour": [4, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4], "reason": ["Score: 4/5\n\nExplanation:\n- Research Objective Clarity\n  - Strengths: The Abstract clearly states the paper’s purpose as a comprehensive survey of how LLMs can transform telecommunications, including “principles, key techniques, and opportunities.” It specifies the technical scope (“transfer learning, prompt engineering, model architectures, reinforcement learning, and energy efficiency”) and the application scope (“network optimization, customer service automation, predictive maintenance, and enhanced communication services”). This establishes a coherent, field-relevant objective aligned with contemporary telecom challenges and 6G integration.\n  - Supporting text: Abstract: “This survey paper … explores the transformative role of LLMs in the telecommunications sector… delves into fundamental principles, advanced techniques… Key applications include network optimization, customer service automation, predictive maintenance… Emerging use cases and challenges such as privacy… computational demands… model scalability are addressed, alongside future research directions…”\n  - Weaknesses: The section “Objectives of the Paper” dilutes clarity by presenting an overly long, heterogeneous list that mixes the survey’s aims with contributions and findings from disparate prior works, some only tangentially related to LLMs for telecom (e.g., “code smells and refactoring,” “[APR] MMAPR,” “tutoring mechanism,” PAC analysis of in-context learning, HDL code generation). Several sentences imply the survey itself introduces or proposes methods developed elsewhere (e.g., “The primary innovation of MMAPR…,” “The survey proposes a PAC-based framework…,” “The survey proposes a new method, InstructGPT…”), which confuses the survey’s objective with literature it reviews. This ambiguity weakens objective specificity.\n  - Supporting text: Objectives of the Paper: “The primary innovation of MMAPR…,” “The survey proposes a PAC-based framework…,” “The survey proposes a new method, InstructGPT…,” “it identifies known aspects of code smells and refactoring…” These read as contributions of individual prior works rather than the survey’s own objectives, making the objective statement diffuse.\n\n- Background and Motivation\n  - Strengths: The “Introduction – Growing Importance of LLMs in Telecommunications” and “Motivation for the Survey” provide rich context: the shift toward connected intelligence and 6G (“seamless interconnectivity…”), practical telecom tasks (network design analysis, anomaly resolution), constraints (energy costs of inference, model deployment on mobile devices, edge collaboration), and privacy/security issues. Together, they substantiate why a telecom-focused LLM survey is timely and necessary.\n  - Supporting text: Introduction: “The evolution of wireless networks is gravitating toward connected intelligence…,” “LLMs optimize data transmission for real-time applications…,” “The growing popularity of LLMs also presents computational challenges… energy costs of inference…,” “deployment in 6G networks enhances AI assistant services…” Motivation for the Survey: “Traditional methods have not effectively leveraged LLMs…,” “limitations of mobile devices in running local LLMs and the necessity for collaboration with edge servers…,” “the urgent need for improved protective measures… privacy protection…”\n  - Weaknesses: Some motivation elements are peripheral or insufficiently tied back to the core survey focus on LLMs for telecom (e.g., Tor website fingerprinting), and the breadth of examples occasionally feels scattershot. While they underscore relevance, tighter linkage of each motivation point to concrete LLM-for-telecom needs would improve coherence.\n\n- Practical Significance and Guidance Value\n  - Strengths: The Abstract and Introduction repeatedly emphasize practical telecom impact: integration into 6G, optimization of network operations, automation of customer support, predictive maintenance, edge deployment strategies, ISATNs, and intent-driven/self-evolving networks. The “Structure of the Survey” section promises coverage of methods directly actionable for telecom practitioners (transfer/fine-tuning, prompt engineering, energy/computation optimization), plus domain adaptation and standard-related tasks (e.g., 3GPP working group identification, SPEC5G).\n  - Supporting text: Abstract: “The survey highlights the potential of LLMs to revolutionize telecommunications… particularly with the anticipated integration into 6G networks.” Introduction/Structure: “Fine-tuning models … to understand telecom-specific language… paves the way for intent-driven, self-evolving wireless networks…,” “LLM deployment at the 6G edge… end-edge cooperation… improve response times and privacy…,” “SPEC5G… facilitating the automation of 5G protocol analysis…”\n  - Weaknesses: The practical value is strong, but the Objectives section’s conflation of reviewed contributions with survey contributions makes it harder to discern what concrete guidance or unique synthesis this survey itself provides beyond broad coverage. A crisper statement of the survey’s unique value (e.g., a taxonomy specific to telecom LLM techniques, a deployment reference architecture for 6G edge, a curated evaluation framework/dataset mapping) would strengthen guidance.\n\nWhy not 5/5:\n- While the Abstract and the introductory background/motivation are comprehensive and field-relevant, the “Objectives of the Paper” section undermines objective clarity by listing numerous, sometimes tangential items and by wording that blurs literature coverage with the survey’s own aims/contributions. This reduces specificity and coherence of the stated objectives.\n\nSuggestions to reach 5/5:\n- Consolidate the objectives into 3–5 precise bullets that are strictly the survey’s own goals, for example:\n  - Provide a telecom-specific taxonomy of LLM techniques (pre-training, adaptation, prompting, RL, efficiency) mapped to 5G/6G use cases.\n  - Systematically evaluate deployment patterns (device/edge/cloud), energy/latency trade-offs, and privacy risks for telecom scenarios.\n  - Synthesize domain adaptation strategies for telecom corpora (e.g., 3GPP, logs), including benchmarks and evaluation protocols (e.g., SPEC5G).\n  - Identify gaps and prioritized research directions for multimodal and agentic LLMs in RAN/core/OSS/BSS contexts and ISATNs.\n- Rephrase references to prior works’ contributions as covered literature rather than survey objectives (e.g., “We review InstructGPT…” instead of “The survey proposes InstructGPT…”).\n- Tighten motivation to telecom-specific pain points (OPEX, SLA assurance, spectrum efficiency, RAN automation, fault management) and explicitly tie each to LLM capabilities, deployment constraints, and required techniques.\n- In the Abstract, add one sentence stating this survey’s unique contributions (e.g., a new taxonomy, a deployment framework, a comparative mapping of models to tasks, or a consolidated checklist for practitioners).", "3\n\nExplanation:\n- Method Classification Clarity: The paper presents an explicit taxonomy under “Key Techniques in LLMs for Telecommunications,” dividing methods into five categories: (1) Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning Techniques, (2) Prompt Engineering and Optimization, (3) Innovative Model Architectures and Adaptations, (4) Reinforcement Learning and Optimization Strategies, and (5) Energy Efficiency and Computational Optimization. This is a reasonable and commonly used way to structure LLM techniques for an application domain, and it appears clearly in the text with dedicated subsections. For example, the “Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning Techniques” subsection enumerates BERT/RoBERTa/GPT-2 fine-tuning, InstructGPT, LoRA-like ideas (e.g., symbol tuning), and time-series repurposing (Time-LLM, LLM-TSF), situating them as adaptation tools for telecom tasks. Similarly, “Prompt Engineering and Optimization” covers DetPro, least-to-most prompting, OPRO, self-refinement, instruction tuning, and domain frameworks like WirelessLLM, indicating how prompts can be optimized for telecom contexts.\n  - However, boundaries between categories sometimes blur and include techniques not tightly tied to telecom or even to the named category. For instance:\n    - “Reinforcement Learning and Optimization Strategies” mixes chain-of-thought prompting (a prompting technique, not RL) with DRLHP (actual preference-based RL) and ReAct (reasoning-acting framework), diluting category purity.\n    - “Innovative Model Architectures” pulls in Meta-Transformer and Zerocap (general multimodal advances) and ViT references, which are only loosely connected to telecom-specific LLM architectures.\n    - “Energy Efficiency and Computational Optimization” includes GPU-parallel training (TeraPipe, Megatron-LM ILMP) and Vision Transformer comparisons; while relevant to efficiency, these are not coherently justified as telecom-specific computational strategies.\n  - The paper earlier states “Four major aspects of LLMs are covered: pre-training, adaptation tuning, utilization, and capacity evaluation [15]” (Objectives of the Paper), but this four-part lens is not actually used to organize the “Key Techniques” section, creating a mismatch between the stated organizational principle and the realized taxonomy.\n\n- Evolution of Methodology: The survey has a dedicated “Evolution of Large Language Models” subsection, briefly noting scaling from early models to GPT-4, GLM-130B’s positioning, and efficiency improvements via ZeRO. It also mentions movement toward multimodal models and 6G integration in other parts (“Integration with Telecommunications,” “Emerging Opportunities and Challenges,” and “Innovations in Multimodal and Adaptive Models”), which together hint at trends such as edge deployment, cooperative split learning (SLS-LLM), instruction tuning/human alignment (InstructGPT), and tool-augmented agents (ReAct).\n  - Nonetheless, the evolution is not systematically presented as a coherent timeline or staged progression specific to telecom. The “Evolution of Large Language Models” section is high-level and does not articulate clear phases (e.g., pretraining era → task-specific fine-tuning → instruction tuning/RLHF → tool use/multi-agent systems → multimodal LMMs → edge/split inference in 6G) with telecom exemplars. Instead, the subsequent “Key Techniques” subsections function as a catalog without explicit inheritance or developmental links between techniques.\n  - Connections between categories and trends are not consistently drawn. For example, while edge deployment and split learning appear in “Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning Techniques” (SLS-LLM) and later in “Emerging Opportunities,” the paper does not explicitly connect how advances in efficiency (e.g., ZeRO, TeraPipe, LoRA) enable the telecom trend of on-device/edge collaboration for 6G. Similarly, the path from prompting advances (least-to-most, CoT) to more agentic frameworks (ReAct) is not narrated as an evolutionary arc.\n  - Several editorial issues suggest incomplete synthesis of the evolution narrative: “The following sections are organized as shown in .” (missing figure), “Tree of Thoughts framework ... achieving a 74” (truncated), “FrugalGPT demonstrates significant cost reductions, achieving up to a 98\\” (truncated). These undermine the systematic portrayal of methodological progression.\n\nOverall, while the taxonomy is visible and broadly reasonable, it is more a topical catalog than a development roadmap; and the evolution narrative is only partially articulated and not tightly tied to telecom milestones. This aligns with a score of 3 per the rubric: somewhat vague classification in places, and a partially clear but insufficiently systematic evolution with limited analysis of inheritance and unclear evolutionary directions.", "2\n\nExplanation:\n\n- Limited diversity and detail of datasets:\n  - The survey names only a few datasets/benchmarks explicitly and provides minimal detail about them. The clearest telecom-specific dataset is SPEC5G: “The SPEC5G dataset, encompassing textual data related to 5G protocol specifications, highlights LLMs' relevance in telecommunications by enabling tasks such as text classification and summarization [41].” While this identifies the domain and task types, it lacks basic dataset descriptors (scale, labeling protocol, splits, licensing, languages, class balance), which are required for high-quality dataset coverage.\n  - It mentions “a comparative analysis using Cradlepoint’s data” in the Structure of the Survey section and again in Applications in Telecommunications, but does not describe what this dataset contains (e.g., number of documents, modalities, annotation scheme), how it was collected, or how it is used for evaluation.\n  - “CloudEval-YAML experiments” are referenced under Network Optimization, but the paper does not explain what CloudEval-YAML is, what datasets and tasks it comprises, or how it maps to telecom LLM use cases.\n  - Outside telecom, it references broad or model-centric artifacts (e.g., “BloombergGPT” and “SciBERT”), but without dataset specifics relevant to telecom; these are not substitutes for domain datasets.\n  - General references to “a comprehensive analysis of datasets related to accuracy, calibration, robustness, fairness, bias, toxicity, and efficiency [36]” under Applications in Various Domains are high-level and do not enumerate datasets nor provide details.\n  - Other mentions (e.g., “SecurityBERT… structured representations of network traffic data [89]”) suggest possible datasets exist, but none are described substantively. Similarly, mentions of time-series forecasting work (Time-LLM, LLM-TSF) provide no dataset identifiers (e.g., M4/M5, ETT, electricity, traffic) or telecom-specific time-series corpora.\n\n- Sparse and non-systematic metrics coverage:\n  - Metrics are referenced only in general or anecdotal terms. For instance: “A comprehensive analysis of datasets related to accuracy, calibration, robustness, fairness, bias, toxicity, and efficiency [36]” lists families of evaluation dimensions but does not specify concrete metrics (e.g., Exact Match, F1, ROUGE/BLEU, ECE, toxicity scores) or how they are applied in telecom tasks.\n  - Under Energy Efficiency and Computational Optimization, the paper notes “Exploring energy consumption metrics provides insights into trade-offs…” and mentions “energy benchmarking for LLM inference [68]”, but does not specify which metrics (e.g., Joules/inference, Tokens/Joule, latency, throughput) or standard tools/benchmarks (e.g., MLPerf Inference, Carbon tracker methodologies).\n  - Some numerical claims are vague or truncated: “achieving a 74…” under Tree of Thoughts and “FrugalGPT… achieving up to a 98\\” (appears truncated) without clear definition of the metric or task context. Predictive maintenance claims “accuracy rates exceeding 90” are similarly non-specific (no task, dataset, or metric definition).\n  - For network-centered evaluation, the survey does not systematically state telecom KPI metrics (latency, reliability, jitter, throughput, spectral efficiency, SLA violations, ticket resolution time) or how LLM-driven systems would be assessed against them.\n  - For code generation and retrieval tasks mentioned, standard metrics (e.g., pass@k for code, Recall@k/MRR/NDCG for retrieval) are not specified.\n\n- Rationale and alignment:\n  - The survey’s objectives emphasize telecom integration, domain adaptation, and evaluation of LLM capabilities in telecom contexts (e.g., SPEC5G, WirelessLLM, ISATNs, customer service automation). However, the dataset and metric choices presented do not sufficiently support these goals. The lack of concrete, telecom-relevant datasets (e.g., annotated 3GPP corpora with labeled tasks, trouble ticket logs, network KPI time series with labeled anomalies, conversation datasets for telecom support) and well-defined evaluation protocols undermines the assessment of applicability.\n  - While some cross-domain benchmarks (GSM8K for reasoning, generic robustness/fairness datasets) are touched upon, their telecom relevance and how they map to telecom tasks are not clarified, nor are domain-appropriate metrics proposed.\n\n- Where the paper does slightly better:\n  - SPEC5G is a relevant telecom dataset and is correctly positioned for tasks like “text classification and summarization [41],” indicating an awareness of domain corpora.\n  - The survey acknowledges evaluation dimensions such as calibration, robustness, fairness, toxicity, and energy efficiency, which are important for real-world deployment. However, it stops short of naming metrics, datasets, or standardized protocols to operationalize these dimensions in telecom.\n\nGiven these observations, the review falls short of a comprehensive and detailed coverage of datasets and metrics. It mentions a few relevant items (e.g., SPEC5G) but does not provide the necessary depth (scale, labels, scenarios) or a systematic metric suite tailored to telecom LLM applications. Therefore, a score of 2 is warranted.", "2\n\nDetailed explanation:\n- Overall assessment: The survey organizes the landscape into thematic buckets (e.g., “Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning Techniques,” “Prompt Engineering and Optimization,” “Innovative Model Architectures and Adaptations,” “Reinforcement Learning and Optimization Strategies,” “Energy Efficiency and Computational Optimization”), which is helpful for structure. However, within these sections the treatment largely catalogs methods with brief one-line characterizations and benefits, with minimal explicit, systematic comparison across dimensions such as assumptions, data needs, compute/latency trade-offs, architecture differences, robustness, or telecom-specific deployment constraints. Advantages and disadvantages are rarely contrasted head-to-head and relationships among methods are not analyzed in a structured way. This aligns with a score of 2: mostly listing rather than comparative evaluation.\n\n- Evidence of listing without systematic comparison:\n  - Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning Techniques: “Models like BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2 exemplify the effectiveness of fine-tuning for telecom-specific tasks [3]. Comparative analyses of open-source models such as CodeGen and commercial models like Codex highlight the transformative impact of fine-tuning in telecom applications [43].” The text cites that comparative analyses exist but does not articulate how CodeGen and Codex differ in architecture, licensing constraints, data dependence, or telecom task performance, nor does it enumerate pros/cons; it remains at a high level.\n  - Prompt Engineering and Optimization: The section lists a series of techniques—“detection prompt (DetPro)… least-to-most prompting… OPRO… Self-refinement… OptiChat… Fantastica… Instruction tuning… ChatNet”—each with a brief, favorable description. There is no comparison of assumptions (e.g., DetPro’s continuous prompts vs grammar prompting’s constraints), overhead, stability, sample efficiency, or suitability to specific telecom scenarios. Phrases like “This is beneficial in telecommunications” or “further illustrate prompt engineering’s transformative impact” do not constitute comparative analysis.\n  - Innovative Model Architectures and Adaptations: Again, this section enumerates methods—“DriveGPT4… Megatron-LM intra-layer model parallelism… Meta-Transformer… Zerocap”—but does not contrast architectural differences (e.g., token-space unification in Meta-Transformer vs paired vision-language alignment in Zerocap), training data requirements, or deployment trade-offs pertinent to telecom. Statements like “improve model performance” and “marks a significant advancement” lack grounded comparative metrics or head-to-head distinctions.\n  - Reinforcement Learning and Optimization Strategies: The text lists “chain of thought prompting… DRLHP… ReAct… AgentCF… grammar prompting” and offers positive, generic claims (“enhances task-solving capabilities,” “allows nuanced optimization”). It does not compare when one approach is preferable, their respective scalability, sample complexity, or alignment costs in telecom operations.\n  - Energy Efficiency and Computational Optimization: Multiple techniques are mentioned—“TeraPipe… EPSL… FrugalGPT… ViT… ILMP (Megatron-LM)… Fantastica… energy consumption metrics”—without contrasting their mechanisms (token-level pipeline parallelism vs intra-layer model parallelism), their effects on latency vs throughput, or constraints in edge vs cloud inference. Notably, “FrugalGPT demonstrates significant cost reductions, achieving up to a 98\\” is truncated, reducing clarity and rigor.\n\n- Lack of explicit advantages/disadvantages and commonalities/distinctions:\n  - Across sections, methods are presented with positive descriptors but without explicit disadvantages or limitations. For example, “Advanced techniques like symbol tuning… enhance adaptability to telecom applications [44]” provides no trade-offs compared to prompt tuning, fine-tuning, or LoRA.\n  - The “Structure of the Survey” claims “a comparative analysis using Cradlepoint’s data, showcasing how LLMs can adapt to domain-specific terminology…” but in this manuscript there is no detailed exposition of methods compared, criteria, or outcomes; thus, the claimed comparison is not substantiated with systematic analysis here.\n  - “Evolution of Large Language Models” notes “The GLM-130B model, surpassing GPT-3 175B on multiple benchmarks [4],” but does not dissect why (training data, tokenizer, bilingual objective), nor what that implies for telecom tasks versus other models.\n\n- Limited explanation of differences in terms of architecture, objectives, or assumptions:\n  - Examples: “Intra-layer model parallelism techniques, as proposed in Megatron-LM, improve model performance…” vs “TeraPipe… token-level pipeline parallelism” are mentioned in separate sections, but there is no contrast of architectural implications, communication overhead, or suitability for telecom training/inference regimes.\n  - “ReAct… interleaves reasoning with action generation” and “chain of thought prompting… reasoning exemplars” share a reasoning focus but their differing assumptions and operational contexts are not contrasted (e.g., tool use requirements, latency impact, controllability).\n\n- Fragmentation and clarity issues further weakening rigor:\n  - In “Network Optimization,” “The Tree of Thoughts framework enhances problem-solving, achieving a 74” is incomplete and uninformative for comparative purposes.\n  - In “Energy Efficiency…,” “FrugalGPT demonstrates significant cost reductions, achieving up to a 98\\” is truncated, undermining clarity and preventing quantitative comparison.\n\n- Where the paper does better:\n  - The categorical organization helps readers navigate method families, and the text occasionally links methods to telecom tasks (e.g., “SLS-LLM… across mobile devices and edge servers [7],” “Time-LLM… time series forecasting [46],” “WirelessLLM” across sections). However, these are task-to-method mappings rather than comparative evaluations across dimensions.\n\nGiven these observations, the section mainly lists techniques with limited explicit, structured comparison of advantages/disadvantages, commonalities/distinctions, and differences in architecture/objectives/assumptions. Therefore, a score of 2 is appropriate.", "Score: 3/5\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey offers broad coverage and includes some evaluative comments, but its critical analysis is relatively shallow and uneven. It mostly enumerates methods and applications with brief benefits, while providing limited technically grounded explanations of why methods differ, what assumptions and trade-offs they entail, and how research lines interrelate. Below are specific observations tied to sections and sentences in the text.\n\nWhere the paper provides some analytical interpretation:\n- Challenges and Limitations: This is the strongest locus of causal commentary, moving beyond description to identify some underlying reasons for method constraints.\n  - “Communication overhead in methods like Megatron-LM can hinder scalability as model sizes and GPU counts increase.” This gives a causal mechanism (communication overhead) linked to scalability limits, though it stops short of discussing concrete patterns (e.g., tensor/pipeline parallel communication, KV cache sharding) or mitigation trade-offs.\n  - “Performance inconsistencies based on tokenization strategies pose challenges for LLMs in forecasting tasks, affecting reliability in predictive maintenance applications [6].” This gestures at a root cause (tokenization effects) but does not unpack where/why tokenization hurts time-series modeling (e.g., quantization of numeric patterns, positional encoding interactions), nor compare against alternatives (e.g., continuous embeddings or adapters).\n  - “Reliance on edge servers and potential delays during long-horizon interactions highlight the need for efficient collaboration between mobile devices and edge infrastructure [7].” This identifies a clear deployment trade-off (latency/privacy vs. capability), although it does not analyze scheduling, batching, or offloading policies in depth.\n  - “The lack of paired training data can limit model performance across diverse modalities, impacting adaptability to specific tasks [31].” This is a reasonable causal statement for multimodal models, but lacks follow-through on how meta-learning or contrastive pretraining mitigate it.\n\n- Energy Efficiency and Computational Optimization:\n  - “The TeraPipe technique enhances training for large-scale language models through token-level pipeline parallelism… [65].” and “The ILMP technique, as proposed in Megatron-LM, allows efficient transformer model training by distributing layers across multiple GPUs… [60].” These sentences acknowledge architectural choices designed to address compute/memory bottlenecks, but there is little discussion of the design trade-offs (e.g., bubble overhead, micro-batch sizing, interconnect bandwidth constraints) or their operational implications in telecom workloads (long sequences, burstiness).\n\n- Background and Core Concepts:\n  - “Applying Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning principles offers insights into the finite sample complexity of in-context learning… [31].” This is an attempt to ground behavior in theory. However, the paper does not draw out what this implies for telecom deployments (e.g., data regime requirements, robustness to distributional shift) or compare with alternative views (Bayesian or mechanistic explanations).\n  - “Despite their potential, deploying LLMs is challenging due to high memory and computational demands… Innovations like the Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO) enhance memory efficiency during training [5].” This moves toward causal explanation (memory footprint → ZeRO) but remains a high-level assertion without discussing assumptions (optimizer states, offloading, activation checkpointing) or trade-offs (throughput penalty, fault tolerance).\n\nWhere the paper remains largely descriptive and misses deeper critical analysis:\n- Key Techniques in LLMs for Telecommunications (all subsections: Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning; Prompt Engineering and Optimization; Innovative Model Architectures and Adaptations; Reinforcement Learning and Optimization Strategies; Energy Efficiency and Computational Optimization):\n  - Across these subsections, the survey predominantly lists methods and claims benefits. For example:\n    - “InstructGPT… aligning language models with user intent through human feedback, improving task performance in telecom settings [5].”\n    - “The least-to-most prompting method addresses complex reasoning tasks… [51].”\n    - “The ReAct framework interleaves reasoning with action generation… [45].”\n    - “Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)… reducing memory requirements while enhancing training throughput… [86].”\n  - These statements do not explain fundamental causes of performance differences (e.g., why RLHF’s reward modeling and preference data characteristics matter for telco tasks; when CoT or least-to-most fail or introduce hallucinations; what LoRA’s rank choices trade off in adaptation capacity vs interference; how retrieval-augmented prompting interacts with domain drift in 3GPP specs).\n  - There is little cross-method synthesis. For example, the paper does not systematically connect:\n    - Fine-tuning vs prompt-tuning vs LoRA vs adapters under telecom constraints (data scarcity, privacy, on-device limits).\n    - RLHF/DRLHP vs supervised finetuning in terms of alignment stability, brittleness, and safety for network automation.\n    - Edge/offloading strategies vs energy/latency constraints and how model/parallelism choices exacerbate or mitigate these.\n  - Assumptions remain implicit. For instance, Time-LLM/LLM-TSF are cited for forecasting, but the survey does not analyze assumptions around stationarity, seasonality encoding, or numeric representation challenges for LLMs; nor does it contrast with specialized TS models in telecom telemetry.\n\n- Integration with Telecommunications and Applications of LLMs in Telecommunications:\n  - These sections list applications (e.g., NETBUDDY, VPP, OptiChat, CloudEval-YAML) with benefits (“reducing errors,” “improving satisfaction”), but provide little technical reasoning about why LLMs succeed or fail under telecom data and operational constraints (e.g., noisy logs, multilingual artifacts, strict SLAs, safety requirements).\n  - Claims like “These methods exhibit self-optimizing capabilities, improving coverage and reducing interference, surpassing traditional techniques [64]” are asserted without dissecting the mechanism (e.g., what the learned policy optimizes, exploration safety in live networks, sample efficiency, partial observability), or the trade-offs versus rule-based SON systems.\n\n- Innovative Model Architectures and Adaptations:\n  - Examples such as “Vision Transformer (ViT) … enhancing image processing tasks within telecom systems” and “Zerocap… image-to-text generation” are presented without analyzing why these choices fit telecom data distributions, latency budgets, or deployment constraints, nor comparing to alternatives (CNNs with distillation; lightweight encoders; edge vision models).\n\n- Future Research Directions:\n  - The section enumerates many topics but does not synthesize tensions (e.g., privacy vs performance; generality vs domain specificity; explainability vs autonomy), nor does it articulate hypothesized causal pathways or evaluation criteria that would resolve debates.\n\nAdditional issues that weaken the analytical depth:\n- Occasional incomplete or overgeneral claims without context:\n  - “FrugalGPT demonstrates significant cost reductions, achieving up to a 98…” (sentence appears truncated) and “Experimental results indicate advancements… with accuracy rates exceeding 90” are stated without datasets, baselines, or conditions, limiting evaluative credibility.\n- Limited discussion of failure modes and negative results (e.g., hallucination risks in network configuration generation; brittleness of CoT; safety/rollback mechanisms under RL-based automation).\n- Minimal quantitative or mechanistic comparisons (e.g., attention complexity with long telemetry sequences; KV-cache and memory bandwidth as bottlenecks; inference batching on edge).\n\nSummary judgment:\n- The paper moves beyond pure listing in places (especially the Challenges and Limitations subsection) and occasionally points to causal factors (communication overhead, tokenization effects, edge offloading latency). However, most sections emphasize descriptive coverage over technically grounded comparative analysis, with few explicit discussions of design trade-offs, assumptions, or synthesized relationships across methods and research lines.\n- Therefore, the critical analysis dimension merits a 3/5: it contains basic analytical comments and some evaluative statements, but depth and rigor are limited, and the interpretive insights are not consistently developed across the surveyed methods.", "Score: 4/5\n\nExplanation:\nThe paper identifies a broad and reasonably comprehensive set of research gaps and future work items, touching data, methods, model architectures, deployment, and evaluation. However, most items are presented as brief lists with limited depth on why each gap matters for telecommunications specifically, what the concrete impact would be if unaddressed, or how to prioritize and operationalize solutions. This breadth-with-limited-depth profile aligns with a 4/5 per the rubric.\n\nEvidence of comprehensive gap identification:\n- Challenges and Limitations section explicitly surfaces multiple, diverse gaps:\n  - Data gaps:\n    - “A primary concern is the dependency on training dataset quality and representativeness, affecting LLM generalizability across diverse telecom documents [48].”\n    - “The lack of paired training data can limit model performance across diverse modalities, impacting adaptability to specific tasks [31].”\n  - Privacy and security:\n    - “Privacy concerns are paramount, given LLMs’ requirement for extensive datasets, potentially exposing sensitive information [8].”\n  - Computation/efficiency/scalability:\n    - “Computational demands vary significantly across model sizes and hardware configurations, creating barriers to efficient deployment [4].”\n    - “Communication overhead in methods like Megatron-LM can hinder scalability as model sizes and GPU counts increase.”\n    - “Reliance on edge servers and potential delays during long-horizon interactions highlight the need for efficient collaboration between mobile devices and edge infrastructure [7].”\n  - Methods/accuracy/robustness:\n    - “Performance inconsistencies based on tokenization strategies pose challenges for LLMs in forecasting tasks, affecting reliability in predictive maintenance applications [6].”\n    - “Models like InstructGPT still exhibit inaccuracies, indicating ongoing challenges in aligning LLMs with user expectations [5].”\n    - “Limitations in capturing user behavior nuances due to reliance on existing interaction records hinder comprehensive user model development [29].”\n    - “Emphasis on model scale rather than architectural nuances may restrict understanding of LLM capabilities, necessitating tailored solutions [25].”\n  - Ambition/AGI trajectory:\n    - “Transitioning from traditional next-word prediction to achieving deeper artificial general intelligence (AGI) to tackle complex telecom issues is a significant challenge [1].”\n\n- Future Research Directions section spans many actionable directions, indicating breadth:\n  - Network/physical layer optimization:\n    - “Refining heuristic algorithms and integrating machine learning techniques to optimize Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-assisted networks [77].”\n    - “Investigating hybrid access techniques and AI integration in optimizing NOMA systems [21].”\n  - Evaluation and benchmarks:\n    - “Expanding benchmarks to encompass a broader array of hardware design scenarios and programming languages [43].”\n  - Methodological improvements for forecasting and reasoning:\n    - “Enhancing tokenization methods and improving uncertainty calibration techniques … for a wider range of forecasting tasks [47].”\n    - “Integrating reasoning and acting in complex scenarios, along with enhancements to model architecture [45].”\n    - “Refining retrieval techniques for NLP models to boost LLM adaptability in telecom tasks [30].”\n  - Multilingual/domain transfer and training optimization:\n    - “Optimizing training processes and applying GLM-130B in various languages or specialized domains [4].”\n  - Human-model interaction and behavior modeling:\n    - “Enhancing models’ adaptability to new user behaviors and incorporating non-verbal cues for improved interaction simulations [29].”\n  - Broader AI directions and ethics:\n    - “Explor[ing] new paradigms in AI development … and examining ethical and societal implications of AGI [1].”\n  - Documentation and process automation:\n    - “Applying existing methods to a wider range of documents and integrating generative AI techniques to streamline automation processes [3].”\n\n- Emerging Opportunities and Challenges section also indirectly points to gaps by framing opportunity areas that remain underdeveloped for telecom-scale deployment:\n  - Efficiency/scalability:\n    - “Opportunities in Model Efficiency and Scalability” citing ALBERT [84], TeraPipe [65], LoRA [86], and prompt tuning [88], indicating ongoing needs to reduce memory/latency/energy for telecom use cases.\n  - Edge deployment and privacy trade-offs:\n    - “Deploying LLMs at the edge improves response times and privacy… [26],” implying gaps in robust, privacy-preserving edge solutions at telecom scale.\n\nWhy it is not a 5:\n- Limited depth of causal analysis and impact:\n  - While many gaps are named, the paper rarely explains the telecom-specific ramifications in detail. For instance, “Privacy concerns are paramount…” [8] does not analyze how telecom regulatory obligations (e.g., lawful intercept, DPI, data residency) or operator data-sharing constraints shape feasible LLM training/deployment pipelines, nor the operational risks if mishandled.\n  - “Computational demands vary significantly…” [4] and “Communication overhead…” (Megatron-LM) are noted, but there is limited analysis of how these constraints manifest in real operator environments (e.g., OPEX/energy budgets, latency SLAs in RAN/Core/edge segments), or how they impact closed-loop automation safety.\n  - “Reliance on edge servers…” [7] identifies a performance issue but does not deeply analyze the impact on long-horizon control loops, service reliability, or mitigation trade-offs (e.g., partial on-device inference, model partitioning, caching).\n  - “Performance inconsistencies based on tokenization…” [6] and forecasting reliability are mentioned without exploring the downstream effects on maintenance scheduling, SLA breaches, or cost-of-failure in telecom operations.\n\n- Lack of systematic structuring and prioritization:\n  - The Future Research Directions list is extensive but not organized into a clear taxonomy (e.g., data, model/learning methods, system integration, evaluation/benchmarks, governance/safety) nor prioritized by urgency, maturity, or impact on 5G/6G roadmaps.\n  - Many items are generic to AI research (e.g., AGI ethics, better reasoning) and not always tied back with depth to telecom-specific constraints, KPIs, and standards.\n\n- Limited discussion on verification/validation and safety of autonomous control:\n  - Given the telecom context, there is little gap analysis on verification and validation of LLM-driven actions in network control loops, safety guarantees, rollback/guardrails, observability, and incident response—critical for carrier-grade reliability.\n\n- Evaluation and reproducibility gaps are only lightly treated:\n  - While “Expanding benchmarks…” [43] and SPEC5G [41] are mentioned, there is limited analysis of comprehensive evaluation protocols, cross-operator datasets, domain drift over 3GPP releases, or standardized metrics for LLM-in-the-loop network operations.\n\nOverall judgment:\n- The section identifies many of the right unknowns and needed directions across data, methods, deployment, and evaluation, supporting a high score on coverage.\n- The treatment is often brief and does not fully analyze why each gap matters for telecom operations, regulatory compliance, or 6G evolution, nor the potential impact if left unresolved—hence not at the “deeply analyzed” level required for 5/5.", "4\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe survey proposes several forward-looking research directions that are clearly grounded in identified gaps and real-world telecom needs, but the analysis of potential impact and the specificity of actionable pathways are somewhat shallow, preventing a top score.\n\nStrengths supporting the score:\n- Clear linkage to real-world telecom problems:\n  - Future Research Directions explicitly targets telecom-specific systems such as “Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-assisted networks” (“Future research on LLMs in telecommunications should prioritize refining heuristic algorithms and integrating machine learning techniques to optimize Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-assisted networks [77].”), and “NOMA systems” (“Investigating hybrid access techniques and AI integration in optimizing NOMA systems presents emerging trends worthy of exploration [21].”). These topics respond to practical challenges in next-generation wireless networks.\n  - The paper connects forecasting challenges to predictive maintenance and operations: “Enhancing tokenization methods and improving uncertainty calibration techniques will be crucial for applying LLMs to a wider range of forecasting tasks [47].” This is aligned with telecom time-series forecasting needs identified earlier in Applications and Challenges.\n  - It addresses protocol complexity and domain specificity with actionable suggestions: “Expanding benchmarks to encompass a broader array of hardware design scenarios and programming languages could yield insights into optimizing telecom applications [43].” and “Refining retrieval techniques for NLP models to boost LLM adaptability in telecom tasks is essential [30].” These map to real needs in handling 5G/6G specifications (see the SPEC5G mentions in Applications and Emerging Opportunities).\n  - User-centric system needs are acknowledged: “Enhancing models' adaptability to new user behaviors and incorporating non-verbal cues for improved interaction simulations represent critical future research areas [29].” This ties to customer service automation and agent behavior challenges discussed earlier.\n  - Multimodal and adaptive model directions are concrete and telecom-relevant: In Innovations in Multimodal and Adaptive Models, the paper suggests “focusing on enhancing these models' capabilities in niche domains and further architectural improvements to boost performance [90].” and highlights cross-modality approaches like the Meta-Transformer (“mapping raw input data from various modalities into a shared token space... without requiring paired data [31]”), which are highly pertinent to heterogeneous telecom data streams (e.g., logs, sensor data, configuration texts, vision for field operations).\n\n- Alignment to identified gaps and limitations:\n  - The Challenges and Limitations section surfaces specific issues—e.g., “lack of paired training data” [31], “performance inconsistencies based on tokenization strategies” [6], “dependency on training dataset quality” [48], and “reliance on edge servers and potential delays during long-horizon interactions” [7]. The Future Research Directions respond to these by proposing “enhancing tokenization methods,” “optimizing training processes and applying GLM-130B in various languages or specialized domains [4],” and improving interaction modeling (“incorporating non-verbal cues [29]”). This shows thoughtful continuity from gaps to proposed work.\n  - The need to improve reasoning and action integration is acknowledged: “Integrating reasoning and acting in complex scenarios, along with enhancements to model architecture, could significantly advance LLM capabilities [45].” This directly addresses documented reasoning deficits and operational constraints in telecom automation.\n\n- Novel and specific topics:\n  - The proposal to “expand benchmarks... hardware design scenarios and programming languages” [43] is concrete and innovative for bridging LLMs to HDL/code synthesis use cases noted earlier.\n  - The call to “refine retrieval techniques” [30] and “improve uncertainty calibration” [47] are practical, measurable research avenues that can be turned into clear experimental protocols and deployment criteria.\n\nLimitations preventing a score of 5:\n- The discussion is largely enumerative and lacks depth on academic and practical impact:\n  - Many directions are listed briefly without detailing why they are the most impactful for telecom, what metrics should be used, or how they would be operationalized in real deployments (e.g., RIS/NOMA suggestions do not specify concrete evaluation frameworks or integration layers for LLM-driven control).\n  - General statements like “explore new paradigms in AI development, addressing current model limitations and examining ethical and societal implications of AGI [1]” and “applying existing methods to a wider range of documents [3]” are broad and traditional for surveys; they do not present a clear, actionable path tailored to telecom constraints.\n- Limited analysis of cause-and-effect for gaps:\n  - While gaps are identified in Challenges, the Future Research Directions do not deeply analyze root causes (e.g., why tokenization hurts time-series forecasting in telecom data, or the specific architectural bottlenecks in edge-device cooperation) or the expected quantitative impact of proposed remedies.\n- Prioritization and roadmap are missing:\n  - The paper does not lay out a prioritized agenda (near-term vs. long-term), nor does it propose milestone-driven studies or standardized benchmarks for evaluating success across telecom subdomains (e.g., network optimization, customer care agents, predictive maintenance).\n\nSpecific parts that support the evaluation:\n- Future Research Directions:\n  - “Refining heuristic algorithms and integrating machine learning techniques to optimize Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-assisted networks [77].”\n  - “Investigating hybrid access techniques and AI integration in optimizing NOMA systems [21].”\n  - “Expanding benchmarks... hardware design scenarios and programming languages [43].”\n  - “Enhancing tokenization methods and improving uncertainty calibration techniques... forecasting tasks [47].”\n  - “Exploring new paradigms in AI... ethical and societal implications of AGI [1].”\n  - “Integrating reasoning and acting in complex scenarios... enhancements to model architecture [45].”\n  - “Refining retrieval techniques... boost LLM adaptability in telecom tasks [30].”\n  - “Optimizing training processes and applying GLM-130B... languages or specialized domains [4].”\n  - “Enhancing models' adaptability to new user behaviors and incorporating non-verbal cues [29].”\n  - “Applying existing methods to a wider range of documents and integrating generative AI techniques to streamline automation processes [3].”\n- Innovations in Multimodal and Adaptive Models:\n  - “DriveGPT4 exemplifies advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs)...”\n  - “Meta-Transformer... mapping raw input data... without requiring paired data [31].”\n  - “Future research could focus on enhancing these models' capabilities in niche domains and further architectural improvements [90].”\n- Challenges and Limitations (as the basis for gaps addressed):\n  - “lack of paired training data” [31]\n  - “performance inconsistencies based on tokenization strategies” [6]\n  - “dependency on training dataset quality and representativeness” [48]\n  - “reliance on edge servers and potential delays” [7]\n\nOverall, the survey does identify numerous forward-looking, telecom-grounded directions and ties them to known gaps, but it stops short of providing a thorough impact analysis and an actionable roadmap. Hence, it merits 4 points."]}
{"name": "x", "paperold": [4, 3, 3, 4]}
{"name": "x", "paperour": [4, 3, 3, 2, 3, 4, 5], "reason": ["Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\n- Research Objective Clarity:\n  - The Abstract clearly states the survey’s aim to “explore the integration of LLMs within telecommunications, focusing on foundational principles, key techniques, and emerging opportunities,” and enumerates core applications (e.g., “network optimization, customer service automation, and predictive maintenance”) while acknowledging challenges (“security, privacy, and computational requirements” and “model interpretability and resource demands”). This establishes a coherent, field-relevant scope.\n  - In the Introduction, the “Objectives of the Survey” subsection articulates multiple concrete goals: to “explore the transformative potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in revolutionizing telecommunications” and “investigates LLM integration into telecommunications to address inefficiencies in network design, configuration, and management” (Objectives of the Survey). It further specifies focus areas such as “augment autonomous edge AI systems” [2], “instruction tuning” [13], “accurately identifying and categorizing telecom language per 3GPP standards” [4], “detecting network-based cyber threats in IoT” [14], “limitations of LLMs… arithmetic and symbolic manipulation” [15], and “assess the performance of advanced models like GPT-4 across domains” [10]. These statements make the objectives explicit, varied, and aligned with telecom needs.\n  - However, the objectives are somewhat broad and include elements that are tangential to telecom-specific concerns (e.g., “basic arithmetic and symbolic manipulation” [15] and “implications of advanced models like GPT-4 for AGI” [10]). The inclusion of general AI performance topics without tight telecom framing dilutes focus and reduces specificity (e.g., “assess performance … across domains, including mathematics, coding, and vision” under Objectives of the Survey). The absence of clearly formulated research questions or delimitation criteria also makes the direction less sharply defined.\n\n- Background and Motivation:\n  - The “Importance of LLMs in Telecommunications” subsection provides rich and well-cited motivation: zero-shot time series forecasting for network management [1], the shift to “connected intelligence” [2], LLMs’ strengths in “pattern recognition and reasoning” [3], their role in “telecom network design and deployment” via generative AI [4], and open-source advancements like GLM-130B [5]. It also contextualizes practical capabilities (e.g., “generating descriptive captions from images” [6], “bridges language modeling and behavior modeling” [7], and infrastructure advances like “NOMA-assisted NGMA” [8]).\n  - The discussion of limitations (“increasing model size does not inherently enhance helpfulness or truthfulness” [9]) and future-facing considerations (“implications of advanced models like GPT-4 for AGI” [10]) shows awareness of the field’s core issues, grounding the motivation for the survey.\n\n- Practical Significance and Guidance Value:\n  - Both the Abstract and Introduction promise actionable insights across techniques and deployment (e.g., “instruction tuning,” “pre-training and fine-tuning,” “multi-modal learning,” “optimization strategies,” “prompt engineering” under Structure of the Survey; and integration into “AI-native 6G” frameworks [4,16]). The emphasis on domain adaptation to telecom standards (e.g., “identifying 3GPP standard working groups” with BERT/RoBERTa [4]) and edge AI/6G integration indicates strong practical relevance.\n  - The “Structure of the Survey” outlines a logical progression from principles to techniques, applications, challenges, and future directions, suggesting clear guidance for researchers and practitioners.\n\nOverall, the paper presents clear and relevant objectives with robust motivation and tangible practical value, but the breadth and occasional tangential aims reduce specificity and focus. Hence, a score of 4 is warranted.", "3\n\nExplanation:\n- Method Classification Clarity:\n  - The survey does present a recognizable classification scheme across “Principles of LLMs in Telecommunications” and “Key Techniques for LLM Integration.” In particular, the subdivision into “Transfer Learning and Adaptability,” “Model Architecture and Scalability,” and “Efficiency and Parameter Reduction” (in the Principles section) and into “Pre-training and Fine-tuning,” “Integration of Multi-Modal Learning,” “Optimization and Efficiency Techniques,” and “Prompt Engineering and Interactive Techniques” (in the Key Techniques section) is a reasonable framing for the field. This is stated explicitly: “emphasizing three main areas: transfer learning and adaptability, model architecture and scalability, and efficiency and parameter reduction. Each of these domains is further delineated into specific techniques and methodologies…” These headings provide a workable taxonomy and reflect common methodological pillars in LLM research, which supports clarity.\n  - However, there are notable overlaps and boundary ambiguities that reduce clarity. For example, “Transfer Learning and Adaptability” includes fine-tuning of BERT/RoBERTa/GPT-2 on telecom documents (“Fine-tuning models such as BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2 on technical documents…”), while “Pre-training and Fine-tuning” later treats fine-tuning as a separate category. This duplication makes category boundaries unclear. Similarly, “Model Architecture and Scalability” mixes low-level architectural techniques (e.g., “Integration of multi-query attention”) with broader application frameworks and domains (e.g., “Frameworks like WirelessLLM adapt LLMs to wireless communication networks…”), conflating architecture with application-level integration.\n  - The “Key Terms and Concepts” section introduces items like “Deep Fingerprinting” (website fingerprinting with CNNs) and “Grammar prompting,” which are either tangential to telecom LLMs or not integrated back into the method taxonomy, further diluting classification coherence. The presence of placeholders (“illustrates these principles…” and “Table provides a detailed overview…”) without actual figures/tables also suggests incomplete scaffolding that would have clarified the taxonomy.\n\n- Evolution of Methodology:\n  - The survey attempts to address evolution in “Evolution of AI in Telecommunications,” touching on a progression from LLMs in forecasting (“particularly in forecasting applications managing diverse time-series data patterns”), to edge AI and connected intelligence (“Edge AI solutions for connected intelligence…”), to agent-based deployment in 6G and offloading to edge servers (“Deploying LLM agents in 6G networks… offloading complex tasks to edge servers”), and resource/energy considerations (“energy costs associated with LLM inference”). This does reflect some developmental trends in the field (movement toward edge deployment, agentified LLMs, and efficiency considerations).\n  - However, the evolutionary narrative is not systematically presented. There is no clear chronological structure, phase delineation, or explicit tracing of how specific methods evolved from earlier ones and informed subsequent techniques. The section intermixes disparate topics (e.g., “Verilog code generation,” “effective NOMA design,” “MOEA replacement”) without connecting them along a telecom LLM methodology trajectory. The survey does not articulate inheritances between methods (e.g., from instruction tuning to agent frameworks to multi-modal LLMs in telecom) or explain how challenges (alignment, efficiency) spurred specific methodological shifts.\n  - Coherence concerns appear where techniques are introduced only in the conclusion without integration into the earlier evolutionary path (e.g., “Tree-of-Thought (ToT) … surpassing traditional methods” is highlighted in the conclusion but absent from the prior classification/evolution sections). Similarly, “Table provides a detailed overview…” in “Model Interpretability and Evaluation” references missing content that would have helped show trends and comparative evolution.\n  - Overall, while trends are mentioned (edge/6G agents, efficiency, multi-modal integration), the evolution is more a collection of points than a systematically traced progression with clear stages and connections.\n\nIn summary, the taxonomy is recognizable but blurred by overlaps and mixed granularity, and the evolution is partially described but not systematically connected or staged. These issues align with a score of 3: some clarity and partial evolutionary cues, but lacking detailed analysis of inheritances and clear evolutionary directions.", "3\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey mentions several datasets and evaluation benchmarks, but coverage is limited, scattered across sections, and generally lacks detail about dataset scale, application scenarios, labeling methods, and standardized evaluation protocols specific to telecommunications.\n\nEvidence of coverage:\n- Datasets and benchmarks referenced are mostly generic to NLP/LLM research rather than telecom-specific:\n  - Foundational Principles and Background: Mentions SciBERT for domain adaptation and “a diverse biomedical text dataset” [19], which is outside the telecom domain and does not include details such as size, labeling, or tasks (“A diverse biomedical text dataset supports various NLP tasks…” in Key Terms and Concepts).\n  - Transfer Learning and Adaptability: References GSM8K and BBH benchmarks for reasoning and chain-of-thought prompting [9], which are general math/logic benchmarks rather than telecom datasets (“Benchmarks like GSM8K and BBH provide structured assessments…”).\n  - Pre-training and Fine-tuning: Notes GLM-130B uses “a dataset of real-world bilingual texts” [5], but provides no details on the dataset composition, scale, or relevance to telecom-specific tasks.\n  - Objectives and Applications: Mentions fine-tuning BERT/RoBERTa to identify 3GPP standard working groups [4] and processing 3GPP documents, but does not describe the dataset’s construction, labeling methodology, size, or public availability.\n  - Evolution of AI in Telecommunications: References a Verilog code generation benchmark [29] and SPEC5G [54] (“SPEC5G benchmark impacts the field…”), but provides no concrete description of dataset contents, tasks, or evaluation setup for telecom protocol analysis.\n- Metrics are referenced but not systematically described or mapped to telecom use cases:\n  - Natural Language Processing in Telecommunications: Mentions BERTScore for text generation evaluation [26], but lacks discussion of other standard text metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, perplexity) or their appropriateness for telecom documentation tasks.\n  - Model Interpretability and Evaluation: States a “Table provides a detailed overview of representative benchmarks,” yet the content of the table is not present in the text, and specific metrics are only abstractly mentioned (“evaluation frameworks must expand beyond accuracy to include calibration, robustness, and bias”).\n  - Computational and Resource Requirements: Mentions energy costs and inference times across GPUs [31], which are useful system-level metrics, but does not present concrete measurement protocols, thresholds, or standard reporting practices for telecom deployments.\n  - Optimization and Efficiency Techniques: References FrugalGPT’s cost-quality trade-offs [46] and ZeRO/TeraPipe/IMP approaches [44,45,42], but these are training/inference efficiency techniques, not evaluation metrics; no task-level performance measures (e.g., accuracy, F1, AUC) are laid out for telecom applications.\n\nGaps affecting the score:\n- Lack of telecom-specific dataset cataloging. The survey does not cover widely used telecom datasets for:\n  - Network intrusion/anomaly detection (e.g., UNSW-NB15, CIC-IDS2017, MAWI),\n  - Traffic classification (e.g., ISCX VPN/Non-VPN, Tor datasets),\n  - Time-series KPIs for network optimization (with details of sampling rates, horizons, and target variables),\n  - Customer service dialogues/call center transcripts relevant to telecom.\n- Missing dataset details. When datasets or corpora are mentioned (e.g., 3GPP documents, GLM-130B bilingual corpus), the survey does not describe:\n  - Scale (number of samples, tokens, duration),\n  - Labeling schemes (how working groups or tasks are annotated),\n  - Modality composition (text/audio/logs/images),\n  - Access and licensing, or benchmark splits and protocols.\n- Metrics not well aligned to telecom tasks. The survey does not explain which metrics are most meaningful for:\n  - Forecasting/network optimization (e.g., MAE, RMSE, MAPE, SMAPE, coverage of prediction intervals),\n  - Customer service automation (e.g., intent accuracy, CSAT surrogate measures, dialog success rates, hallucination rates),\n  - Security/threat detection (e.g., ROC-AUC, precision/recall, FPR at fixed TPR, detection latency),\n  - System-level performance (e.g., end-to-end latency, throughput, SLA compliance, resource utilization).\n- Limited rationale and evaluation design. There is little discussion of why particular datasets/metrics were chosen, how they support telecom objectives, or how to design experiments (e.g., offline vs. online A/B testing for customer service, time-series rolling validation protocols for network KPIs).\n\nWhy this is a 3 and not lower:\n- The survey does reference multiple datasets/benchmarks and metrics, albeit mostly generic:\n  - BERTScore [26], GSM8K and BBH [9], Verilog benchmark [29], DF/Tor traffic [32], SPEC5G [54], and computational metrics like energy/inference time [31].\n- It also touches on evaluation considerations (calibration, robustness, bias) and hints at benchmarking for 5G protocol analysis, which indicates awareness of evaluation needs in telecom contexts.\n\nHowever, due to the lack of detailed descriptions, telecom-specific dataset coverage, and clear, targeted metric selection tied to applications, the section falls short of comprehensive coverage and rationality required for a higher score.", "2\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey provides broad coverage of methods and techniques relevant to LLMs in telecommunications, but the comparative analysis is mostly implicit, fragmented, and lacks a systematic, dimensioned framework. Across the sections after the introduction (Background and Core Concepts, Principles of LLMs in Telecommunications, Key Techniques for LLM Integration, and Challenges and Future Directions), the paper primarily lists representative methods, frameworks, and findings without consistently contrasting them in terms of architecture, objectives, assumptions, data dependency, learning strategy, or application scenario.\n\nEvidence supporting this assessment:\n\n- Background and Core Concepts:\n  - Foundational Principles of Large Language Models: The text mentions specific approaches (e.g., “Vision Transformer (ViT) exemplifies this by utilizing the Transformer architecture for image classification without convolutional networks [4]”) but does not compare ViT against CNNs or other vision architectures across dimensions such as data efficiency, computational complexity, or robustness. It also lists mechanisms like “in-context learning (ICL)” and “attention mechanisms,” and models like SciBERT, but stops short of structured comparison among these techniques.\n  - Natural Language Processing in Telecommunications: The section enumerates techniques—“transfer learning,” “least-to-most prompting [23],” “subword regularization [24],” “BERTScore [26],” “MLLMs [27],” and “Multimodal learning [28]”—with benefits described, yet there’s no explicit contrast between these methods (e.g., prompting strategies vs finetuning vs subword techniques) on assumptions, data requirements, or telecom applicability.\n\n- Principles of LLMs in Telecommunications:\n  - Transfer Learning and Adaptability: This part lists many methods and tools—fine-tuning BERT/RoBERTa/GPT-2 on telecom documents [4], AgentCF [7], benchmarks like GSM8K/BBH and CoT prompting [9], ReAct [30], Grammar Prompting [21], Zerocap [6]—but does not systematically compare them. For instance, while it notes “chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting [9]” and “ReAct, combining reasoning and action generation [30],” it does not articulate differences in objectives (reasoning-only vs reasoning-action integration), assumptions (availability of external tools or environments), or trade-offs (latency, reliability in telecom tasks).\n  - Model Architecture and Scalability: The section states “Integration of multi-query attention reduces tensor size [35]” and mentions “skip connections and MLPs [36]” and evaluation frameworks [37], but does not compare attention variants (e.g., multi-query vs standard multi-head vs FlashAttention) or dense vs MoE architectures across performance, memory, and latency dimensions relevant to telecom.\n  - Efficiency and Parameter Reduction: There are isolated pros/cons—“Prompt tuning adapts large models without full parameter tuning [40],” “IMP aids in training large transformer models [42],” and “Benchmarking energy costs of inference… [31]”—but no side-by-side comparison (e.g., prompt tuning vs LoRA/adapters vs full fine-tuning; IMP vs pipeline parallelism) with technical depth on trade-offs such as stability, convergence, data needs, and deployment constraints in telecom systems.\n\n- Key Techniques for LLM Integration:\n  - Optimization and Efficiency Techniques: The paper lists ZeRO [44], multi-query attention [35], TeraPipe [45], IMP [42], FrugalGPT [46], CVXPY [47], and the DF approach [32], primarily describing each method’s benefits (“optimize memory usage,” “reduce memory bandwidth,” “fine-grained parallelism,” “minimizing costs”). It does not contrast these techniques (e.g., ZeRO vs IMP vs TeraPipe) in terms of architecture, communication overhead, hardware requirements, or suitability for real-time telecom constraints.\n  - Pre-training and Fine-tuning and Prompt Engineering and Interactive Techniques: These sections describe approaches (“GLM-130B [5],” “3GPP fine-tuning [4],” “entropy-based prompt selection [48]”) but do not present structured comparisons between pretraining strategies, finetuning styles (full vs parameter-efficient), or prompting paradigms under telecom conditions (e.g., data scarcity, latency bounds, domain shift, multilinguality).\n\n- Challenges and Future Directions:\n  - Security and Privacy: The discussion references privacy-preserving network management [53], decentralized training [2], and limitations (“Some methods falter against advanced defenses like Walkie-Talkie [32]”) but does not compare security approaches (centralized vs decentralized; differential privacy vs encryption; attack models vs defenses) along assumptions, robustness, and operational cost.\n  - Model Interpretability and Evaluation: The text notes “tutor mechanism [15],” “multi-step reasoning benchmarks [57],” “CoT variability [58],” and “ReAct [59],” but again does not contrast interpretability methods or evaluation protocols systematically (e.g., transparency vs performance trade-offs, calibration vs accuracy, robustness vs bias).\n  - Computational and Resource Requirements: While it mentions “Prompt tuning… [40],” “IMP… [42],” and energy/inference variations [31], it neither compares methods across hardware profiles nor explores architectural differences in depth (e.g., MoE vs dense compute profiles, attention optimization variants, adapter vs LoRA vs prefix-tuning).\n\nLimited instances of explicit advantages/disadvantages:\n- “increasing model size does not inherently enhance helpfulness or truthfulness [9]” (Introduction) indicates a drawback for scale-alone strategies but lacks comparison to alignment techniques.\n- “Some methods falter against advanced defenses like Walkie-Talkie [32]” (Security and Privacy) acknowledges limitations but does not compare alternative defenses.\n- “CoT prompting showing performance variability based on exemplar selection [58]” (Model Interpretability and Evaluation) points out instability but does not contrast with alternative prompting or reasoning frameworks.\n\nOverall, while the paper is comprehensive in coverage and cites many techniques and frameworks, it largely presents them in a descriptive, list-like manner without a systematic comparative framework. It rarely explains differences in terms of architecture, objectives, or assumptions, nor does it map methods to application scenarios with explicit trade-offs. Therefore, the comparison depth and rigor align with a score of 2 under the provided criteria.", "Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey provides a broad, well-organized descriptive overview of methods and techniques, with occasional evaluative remarks, but it generally lacks deep, technically grounded analysis of underlying mechanisms, design trade-offs, and fundamental causes of differences across methods. The commentary is more catalog-like than reflective, and where limitations or advantages are noted, they are not unpacked in detail. Below are specific examples from the relevant sections that support this assessment.\n\n- Background and Core Concepts → Foundational Principles of Large Language Models:\n  - The paper states, “In-context learning (ICL) enhances this adaptability by allowing LLMs to perform diverse tasks using incorporated training examples, eliminating the need for weight adjustments [18].” and “Attention mechanisms are central to LLM design, enhancing reasoning capabilities, particularly in multi-modal data integration scenarios [6].” These are accurate descriptions but do not analyze why ICL succeeds or fails (e.g., data distribution alignment, context length constraints, spurious pattern induction) or the trade-offs of attention variants (e.g., memory vs representational diversity).\n  - “Optimization strategies like FrugalGPT introduce cascade mechanisms to optimize LLM selection for queries, ensuring efficiency and quality output, crucial for real-time processing in telecommunications [20,10].” This mentions an efficiency aim but lacks discussion of routing errors, latency-accuracy trade-offs, or conditions under which such cascades degrade reliability.\n  - “Despite advancements, LLMs face challenges in generalizing from few examples in complex domains, limiting applicability [21].” The limitation is noted, but there is no causal explanation (e.g., compositional generalization issues, tokenization bias, or mismatch between pretraining corpora and telecom domain semantics).\n\n- Principles of LLMs in Telecommunications → Transfer Learning and Adaptability:\n  - The section lists many methods (CoT, ReAct, MLLMs, CVXPY, Grammar Prompting) and claims they “enhance performance,” e.g., “Benchmarks like GSM8K and BBH provide structured assessments of LLM optimization capabilities, with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting crucial for enhancing model performance in complex tasks [9].” However, there is no analysis of when CoT helps vs hurts (e.g., verbosity leading to error propagation, exemplar selection sensitivity) beyond later brief mentions.\n  - “Larger models that override semantic priors significantly improve learning new input-label mappings, showcasing advancements over smaller models [19].” This suggests a mechanism (overriding priors), but it is not developed—no discussion of capacity vs inductive bias, data regime dependencies, or risks (e.g., overfitting spurious mappings).\n\n- Principles → Model Architecture and Scalability:\n  - “Integration of multi-query attention reduces tensor size, optimizing computational efficiency for large-scale data processing [35].” and “Understanding convergence behavior in self-attention outputs emphasizes architectural components like skip connections and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs)…” These statements are descriptive. They do not engage with trade-offs (e.g., loss of head-specific KV representations in multi-query attention and its accuracy impacts; skip connections improving gradient flow but potentially encouraging shallow processing).\n  - The synthesis across research lines is limited. For instance, the text references WirelessLLM, prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation, and domain fine-tuning [33,34,38], but it does not compare when each technique is preferable, how they interact, or their assumptions (e.g., RAG’s dependency on retrieval quality and latency vs fine-tuning’s domain robustness and maintenance costs).\n\n- Principles → Efficiency and Parameter Reduction:\n  - “Prompt tuning adapts large models without full parameter tuning, ensuring robustness in domain transfer [40].” and “Intra-layer model parallelism (IMP) aids in training large transformer models by distributing layers across multiple GPUs, enhancing scalability and efficiency [42].” These are correct descriptions but lack critical trade-off analysis (e.g., prompt tuning’s brittleness under distribution shifts, IMP’s communication overhead and pipeline bubbles; ZeRO’s fragmentation and coordination costs).\n  - “Benchmarking energy costs of inference across various model sizes and GPU configurations provides insights into optimizing resource allocation [31].” This acknowledges resource concerns, but the survey does not explain the fundamental causes (e.g., memory bandwidth constraints, KV cache size scaling, sequence length impacts) or practical design implications (e.g., quantization vs distillation vs attention sparsification choices).\n\n- Key Techniques → Optimization and Efficiency Techniques:\n  - The paper lists ZeRO, multi-query attention, TeraPipe, and IMP, e.g., “ZeRO optimize memory usage during training, facilitating models with trillions of parameters… [44].” and “TeraPipe boosts efficiency through token-level pipeline parallelism… [45].” There is no discussion of the underlying trade-offs such as communication/computation overlap, fragmentation, or latency vs throughput; nor is there reflection on assumptions (e.g., homogeneous hardware availability, network topology constraints in telecom edge settings).\n\n- Key Techniques → Prompt Engineering and Interactive Techniques:\n  - “Generating candidate permutations and evaluating performance using entropy statistics exemplifies prompt engineering’s effectiveness…” This is descriptive and does not analyze causes of prompt sensitivity (e.g., lexical biases, position effects, context window interference).\n  - The interaction with retrieval-augmented generation and domain fine-tuning is asserted (“align, fuse, and evolve knowledge”), but causal mechanisms and limitations (e.g., hallucination under low-quality retrieval, catastrophic forgetting in fine-tuning) are not critically examined.\n\n- Challenges and Future Directions → Security and Privacy:\n  - “Decentralized model training prevents centralization of sensitive information…” and “Some methods falter against advanced defenses like Walkie-Talkie… [32].” The section flags relevant issues but does not explain why DF succeeds/fails under specific defenses, or the privacy-performance trade-offs (e.g., federated learning communication costs vs privacy budgets; split learning attack surfaces).\n\n- Challenges → Model Interpretability and Evaluation:\n  - The survey notes: “CoT prompting showing performance variability based on exemplar selection [58].” and “frameworks like PAC learning highlight misalignments…” This hints at underlying causes but stops short of technical explanation (e.g., how prompt-induced trajectories condition attention heads, or how calibration failures manifest in telecom tasks).\n  - It calls for broader metrics (“calibration, robustness, and bias”), but does not synthesize across evaluation lines or explain methodological implications (e.g., how to measure calibration in time-series forecasts, or telecom-specific robustness criteria like latency under load).\n\n- Computational and Resource Requirements:\n  - “Tokenization challenges of numerical data, impacting performance in forecasting applications [1]. The Time-LLM framework addresses these…” This is one of the few places where a root cause is identified, but the analysis remains brief; it does not explore numeric-aware tokenization, hybrid encoders, or trade-offs in representing continuous values versus symbolic tokens.\n\nOverall, while the survey occasionally notes limitations (e.g., “model size does not always correlate with performance [9]”; “challenges persist… inconsistent feedback [55]”; “stable network conditions are crucial…”), it rarely explains the fundamental causes, nor does it consistently compare design alternatives with explicit assumptions and trade-offs. The paper synthesizes many strands of work but largely presents them side by side without integrating them into a coherent analytical framework that would guide method choice in telecom contexts (e.g., choosing RAG vs fine-tuning under tight latency budgets; selecting multi-query attention vs standard multi-head attention under accuracy constraints; offloading policies in 6G considering energy, privacy, and QoS). Hence, the analysis is present but relatively shallow and uneven, meriting a score of 3.\n\nResearch guidance suggestions to strengthen critical analysis:\n- Explicitly compare core integration strategies (fine-tuning, prompt tuning, RAG, adapters, distillation), detailing assumptions, telemetry constraints, and trade-offs in latency, accuracy, maintainability, and privacy.\n- Analyze architectural choices (multi-query attention, KV cache compression, sparse attention, mixture-of-experts) with respect to telecom workloads (long-context logs, streaming inference on edge, multi-tenant QoS), including when accuracy degradation is acceptable for latency gains.\n- Examine mechanisms behind prompting methods (CoT, least-to-most, ToT, ReAct), including failure modes (hallucination amplification, exemplar bias), and map them to telecom applications (fault triage, policy compliance).\n- Provide causal explanations for security observations (e.g., why Deep Fingerprinting bypasses defenses; privacy budgets in federated settings; attack surfaces of edge offloading), and relate them to system design choices.\n- Offer synthesized decision frameworks for selecting methods under realistic telecom constraints (bandwidth, on-device memory, regulatory privacy requirements, multi-modal data).", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey identifies a broad set of research gaps and future work across security/privacy, interpretability/evaluation, computational/resource constraints, datasets/benchmarks, and emerging methods. It does so mainly in the “Challenges and Future Directions” and “Emerging Techniques and Future Opportunities” sections, with supporting mentions elsewhere. However, while the coverage is comprehensive, the analysis of each gap is often brief and does not consistently delve into why the gap matters for telecom specifically, the magnitude of its impact, or concrete methodological pathways to address it. This aligns with the 4-point criterion: multiple gaps are identified comprehensively, but the discussion is not fully developed or deeply analyzed.\n\nEvidence from specific parts of the paper:\n\n- Security and Privacy (Challenges and Future Directions):\n  - Identifies gaps and limitations: “Deploying LLMs in telecommunications systems requires addressing security and privacy challenges…” and “challenges persist in environments with hard-to-articulate human preferences or inconsistent feedback…” and “Some methods falter against advanced defenses like Walkie-Talkie…” These sentences show awareness of unresolved issues (privacy-preserving management, robustness to attacks, limitations under human preference noise).\n  - Brief analysis of impact: The section gestures at implications (“ensuring AI-driven systems’ reliability and trustworthiness,” “regulatory compliance”) but does not deeply unpack telecom-specific consequences (e.g., lawful intercept constraints, spectrum policy implications, or compliance frameworks like ETSI/ENISA) or quantify risk. This supports a strong identification but modest depth.\n\n- Model Interpretability and Evaluation (Challenges and Future Directions):\n  - Identifies core interpretability gaps: “The complexity of models like Transformers often obscures decision-making processes,” “Benchmarks focusing on multi-step reasoning reveal LLMs’ reasoning limitations,” “CoT prompting showing performance variability based on exemplar selection,” and “Evaluation frameworks must expand beyond accuracy to include metrics like calibration, robustness, and bias.” These sentences clearly list the shortcomings and needed evaluation dimensions.\n  - Limited depth on impact: Although the need for broader metrics is noted, the paper does not deeply analyze the operational ramifications in telecom (e.g., safety-critical network automation, SLA compliance, explainability obligations for NOC workflows). The lack of domain-grounded case analyses or concrete evaluation protocols reduces the depth.\n\n- Computational and Resource Requirements (Challenges and Future Directions):\n  - Identifies scaling and efficiency gaps: “Traditional model tuning is resource-intensive and impractical,” “Existing training methods struggle to scale with increasing model sizes,” “Experiments show variations in energy costs and inference times based on model size and GPU type,” and “Stable network conditions are crucial for effective module communication.” These sentences show clear awareness of compute, energy, and deployment constraints (edge/server trade-offs).\n  - Brief analysis: The section mentions candidate solutions (prompt tuning, IMP, Time-LLM) but stops short of detailed telecom-specific cost models, latency/throughput targets, or deployment blueprints (e.g., RAN vs. core placement), limiting the depth of impact analysis.\n\n- Data and Benchmarks (Emerging Techniques and Future Opportunities):\n  - Identifies dataset/benchmark gaps: “Future research should prioritize refining model architectures and leveraging diverse datasets from telecommunications standards,” “Expanding benchmarks to encompass broader datasets and tasks, including 5G protocol analysis,” and “pretraining methodologies to include diverse domain-specific texts.” These sentences indicate the need for domain-specific corpora and standardized evaluations.\n  - Limited exploration of why and how: The paper does not deeply examine data availability bottlenecks (e.g., proprietary standards/licensing, multilingual 3GPP artifacts, labeling challenges), nor does it propose concrete dataset schemas or benchmark task taxonomies tailored to telecom operations (fault triage, config validation, protocol compliance).\n\n- Methods and Emerging Directions (Emerging Techniques and Future Opportunities):\n  - Broad list of avenues: “Exploring advanced retrieval techniques,” “developing robust defenses against deep learning-based attacks,” “optimizing LLMs for time-series forecasting via improved tokenization,” “integrating reasoning and action generation (ReAct),” “holistic research for NOMA,” “incorporating human feedback,” “optimizing grammar design,” etc. These sentences show extensive coverage of potential method-oriented directions.\n  - Depth is uneven: The section largely enumerates opportunities without detailing methodological gaps (e.g., telecom-specific retrieval pipelines, alignment strategies for control-plane tasks, formal guarantees for action generation in network automation) or articulating expected impact metrics in telecom settings.\n\nOverall, the survey does an effective job of enumerating and organizing many gaps and future directions across:\n- Security/privacy (“ensuring network data remains unshared with LLMs… decentralized model training…”; limitations under advanced defenses),\n- Interpretability/evaluation (“Transformer complexity… expand beyond accuracy to calibration/robustness/bias… CoT variability”),\n- Computation/resource (“resource-intensive tuning… energy costs and inference times vary… stable network conditions required”),\n- Data/benchmarks (“expand benchmarks to include 5G protocol analysis… diverse domain-specific texts”),\n- Methods/emerging opportunities (“advanced retrieval… defenses against Deep Fingerprinting… grammar prompting applicability…”).\n\nHowever, the analysis of why these gaps are critical and their precise impact on telecom operations, safety, compliance, and economics is generally high-level, with limited domain-specific exemplification, prioritization, or concrete research designs. This justifies a score of 4: comprehensive identification with somewhat brief, underdeveloped analysis.", "4\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey presents several forward-looking research directions that are clearly grounded in real-world telecom challenges and known gaps, but the analysis of their potential impact and the specificity of the proposed agendas are somewhat shallow and scattered, keeping it from a top score.\n\nEvidence of forward-looking directions based on identified gaps and real-world needs:\n- Security and privacy (Challenges and Future Directions – Security and Privacy):\n  - The paper explicitly identifies privacy concerns in network management and proposes concrete directions such as “Implementing privacy-preserving techniques” and “Decentralized model training prevents centralization of sensitive information” and mentions a practical mechanism: “A method that enhances network management while preserving privacy mitigates security concerns by ensuring network data remains unshared with LLMs [53].”\n  - It further proposes resilient, adaptive mechanisms tied to real-world telecom conditions: “Techniques like EODF enhance real-time performance and security by adapting to changing channel conditions and reducing data transmission requirements [56].”\n  - These align well with operational needs in telecom networks and are forward-looking.\n\n- Interpretability and evaluation (Challenges and Future Directions – Model Interpretability and Evaluation):\n  - The survey recognizes a critical gap and suggests improvements beyond standard accuracy metrics: “Evaluation frameworks must expand beyond accuracy to include metrics like calibration, robustness, and bias.”\n  - It points to specific methods as avenues for future work: “Methods like ReAct enhance interpretability by integrating reasoning with action generation” and acknowledges the need to align with user intent: “Zero-shot models like InstructGPT show model size does not always correlate with performance, emphasizing aligning models with user intent over scale [9].”\n  - These are relevant and actionable directions for telecom deployments where reliability and transparency matter.\n\n- Computational/resource constraints (Challenges and Future Directions – Computational and Resource Requirements):\n  - The paper identifies concrete constraints and proposes efficient strategies reflecting real-world deployment needs: “Efficient strategies like prompt tuning adapt large models without full parameter tuning” and “IMP facilitates training large transformer models by distributing layers across GPUs.”\n  - It also ties to realistic performance considerations: “Experiments show variations in energy costs and inference times based on model size and GPU type, underscoring optimized hardware configurations’ importance [31].”\n  - These suggestions are practical for telecom-grade systems and edge deployment scenarios.\n\n- Emerging techniques aligned with telecom needs (Emerging Techniques and Future Opportunities):\n  - The survey offers multiple forward-looking topics grounded in telecom contexts:\n    - “Future research should prioritize refining model architectures and leveraging diverse datasets from telecommunications standards to enhance LLM applicability in specialized domains [4].”\n    - “Expanding benchmarks to encompass broader datasets and tasks, including 5G protocol analysis, will refine LLM evaluation and improve real-world application performance.”\n    - “Exploring advanced retrieval techniques and integrating them into LLM workflows offers promising avenues for enhancing efficiency and accuracy in telecommunications applications [18].”\n    - “Optimizing LLMs for time-series forecasting and predictive maintenance remains critical, particularly through improved tokenization strategies for numerical data.”\n    - “Future efforts should focus on effectively incorporating human feedback into model training, significantly enhancing model performance and alignment with user intent [9].”\n    - “Expanding pretraining methodologies to include diverse domain-specific texts… could further improve LLM adaptability in specialized telecommunications contexts [19].”\n    - “Optimizing grammar design and investigating grammar prompting applicability across various tasks and languages offers another promising research avenue [21].”\n  - These directions directly address sector-typical needs (protocol analysis, forecasting, edge constraints, data heterogeneity, user intent alignment) and propose specific methodological avenues.\n\nReasons it does not merit 5 points:\n- The proposals are often presented as lists without deep analysis of their academic or practical impact, and lack clear, actionable research roadmaps. For example, suggestions like “refining model architectures,” “developing robust defenses,” and “research needs to transcend traditional paradigms, addressing current model limitations and investigating AGI’s societal implications [10]” are broad and not tied to concrete evaluation strategies, milestones, or deployment pathways.\n- Some directions are tangential or generic for telecom LLMs (e.g., “Bridging the gap between code smells and refactoring in software systems could enhance software quality…”), diluting focus on telecom-specific LLM gaps.\n- The survey does not thoroughly explore the causes of certain gaps (e.g., why specific interpretability failures occur in telecom network management contexts) nor quantify expected impact, and it rarely provides detailed examples of datasets, metrics, or architectures tailored to telecom beyond brief mentions (e.g., SPEC5G or 3GPP texts).\n- While sections like Security and Privacy, Model Interpretability and Evaluation, and Computational and Resource Requirements identify real-world problems well and suggest promising directions, the discussion remains relatively brief and lacks a cohesive, actionable path for researchers to follow.\n\nOverall, the survey identifies multiple relevant, forward-looking research areas aligned with real-world telecom needs and known gaps, but it does not fully develop their innovation potential or provide detailed, actionable plans and impact analysis, fitting the 4-point criterion."]}

{"name": "x2", "paperour": [4, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4], "reason": ["Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\n\nOverall assessment\n- The paper’s Abstract and Introduction articulate a clear, survey-style objective focused on LLMs in telecommunications, with an explicit scope (5G/6G, wireless networks, edge deployment) and a stated intent to cover principles, techniques, challenges, and opportunities. The background and motivation are largely sufficient and multi-faceted, and the practical significance is evident. However, the objectives are broad and sometimes diffuse, with some undefined terms (e.g., “wBAIMs”) and missing figure references (“as shown in .”), and the claimed “knowledge gaps” (especially in instruction tuning for telecom) are not concretely specified. These issues prevent a top score.\n\nEvidence supporting Research Objective Clarity\n- Abstract: “This survey paper systematically analyzes the transformative impact of LLMs, focusing on foundational principles, key techniques, and future opportunities for integrating artificial intelligence into telecommunications.” This sentence clearly states the survey’s analytical focus and breadth.\n- Abstract: “It explores the adaptation of LLMs to meet the unique challenges of wireless communication networks, particularly in 5G and emerging 6G technologies, addressing knowledge gaps in instruction tuning crucial for optimizing LLM applications.” This specifies a central angle (wireless/5G–6G) and emphasizes instruction tuning as a focal gap.\n- Objectives of the Survey: “This survey aims to systematically analyze the transformative impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) on the telecommunications industry, focusing on key techniques for effective implementation and future research opportunities.” Clear statement of purpose for a survey.\n- Objectives of the Survey: “It reviews the adaptation of LLMs to address the unique challenges of wireless communication networks… seeks to fill knowledge gaps in instruction tuning… provides insights into the design, deployment, and evaluation of wireless BAIMs (wBAIMs) within 6G networks, intentionally excluding unrelated AI models…” These sentences establish explicit sub-goals and scope boundaries (wireless domain, 6G, exclusion of non-wireless models), which aid clarity.\n- Structure of the Survey: Lays out a logical roadmap—principles (pre-training, adaptation, evaluation), methodologies/datasets (instruction tuning), techniques (data processing, training, integration), opportunities, challenges, and future directions. This supports directional clarity.\n\nGaps/ambiguities affecting Objective Clarity\n- “wBAIMs” is introduced without prior definition (“…design, deployment, and evaluation of wireless BAIMs (wBAIMs) within 6G networks…”), reducing precision.\n- The claim to address “knowledge gaps in instruction tuning” is not made concrete—no explicit sub-questions, taxonomies, or gap inventory are articulated in the Abstract/Introduction.\n- Missing figure references (“as shown in .” in Structure of the Survey and later sections) suggest incomplete presentation of the organizational logic that the text relies on.\n\nEvidence supporting Background and Motivation\n- Introduction—Significance of LLMs in Telecommunications: The text articulates several motivating factors:\n  - “The shift from statistical to neural language models has significantly improved performance… facilitating the integration of LLMs into cloud-native applications… essential for generating cloud configurations” (ties LLM capability evolution to telecom workflows).\n  - “The push for open and efficient foundation language models…” (motivates accessibility and research relevance).\n  - “In the context of 5G… LLMs are poised to support… remote healthcare and smart cities” (connects to telecom service contexts).\n  - “Instruction tuning (IT) is vital… Furthermore, the necessity of offloading complex tasks to edge servers is emphasized…” (highlights controllability and deployment constraints relevant to telecom).\n- Objectives of the Survey: Motivation for telecom-specific focus is bolstered by mentioning edge LLM deployment, multi-modal sensing, resource management, network slicing, and domain specificity (e.g., “technical specification comprehension,” “anomaly resolution”).\n\nWeaknesses in Background and Motivation\n- Some motivations are generic to AI/LLMs (e.g., “automate the design of reward functions… in robotics”) and only loosely tied back to telecom, which dilutes focus.\n- The gap analysis around instruction tuning, telecom-specific datasets/benchmarks, and concrete limitations of current LLMs for telecom tasks is not deeply articulated in the Abstract/Introduction (e.g., which instruction-tuning aspects—data schemas, alignment techniques, safety constraints—are missing for telecom?).\n\nEvidence supporting Practical Significance and Guidance Value\n- Abstract: “It also examines opportunities for AI in network optimization, customer service enhancement, predictive maintenance, and automation, while addressing challenges such as technical and operational barriers, ethical implications, and limitations in model performance.” This highlights clear practical domains and balanced coverage of opportunities and risks.\n- Objectives of the Survey: “provides insights into the design, deployment, and evaluation of [wBAIMs] within 6G networks… emphasizes democratizing access… tackles… multi-modal sensing data… provides… overview of resource management and network slicing… By focusing on edge LLM deployment… underscores the potential for LLMs to revolutionize telecommunications infrastructure and operations.” These statements convey tangible guidance targets (design/deployment insights, edge training/inference, resource management).\n- Structure of the Survey: Explicit plan to discuss implementation techniques (data processing, model training, system integration), challenges/limitations, and future directions—this is practical and useful for stakeholders.\n\nLimitations diminishing Guidance Value\n- The lack of a concise contributions list (e.g., “This survey contributes: 1) taxonomy…, 2) dataset/benchmark summary…, 3) gap analysis…, 4) open problems…”) hampers the reader’s ability to pinpoint actionable takeaways.\n- Undefined terms (e.g., “wBAIMs”) and missing figure references reduce the immediate guidance quality for practitioners.\n\nSummary rationale for the score\n- Strengths: Clear survey intent and scope (telecom/5G–6G focus, instruction tuning angle, edge deployment); adequate background linking LLM capabilities to telecom needs; practical significance delineated across multiple operational domains; a structured roadmap signaling guidance value.\n- Weaknesses: Objectives remain broad; some diffusion into general AI claims; lack of concrete gap definition; undefined acronyms and missing figure references; no crisp contributions list.\n\nGiven these factors, the section merits 4 points: the objectives are clear and valuable, with solid background and meaningful guidance potential, but the presentation lacks the precision and completeness required for a top score.", "Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\n- Method classification clarity: The paper presents several classification axes that are useful but not fully coherent as a unified taxonomy for telecom-specific methods.\n  - The clearest taxonomy appears in “Key Techniques for Implementing LLMs in Telecommunications,” which is organized along the model lifecycle: “Data Processing and Multi-modal Integration,” “Model Training and Optimization Strategies,” “System Integration and Deployment,” “Memory Optimization Techniques,” and “Self-Attention Mechanisms and Overfitting.” This division is reasonably clear and helps readers situate techniques by where they act in the pipeline. The subsections explicitly enumerate techniques (e.g., split learning for edge collaboration [8], QLoRA [59], ZeRO [60], intra-layer model parallelism [61]) and deployment frameworks (e.g., TeraPipe [56], NETBUDDY [55]).\n  - Earlier, “Principles of Large Language Models in Telecommunications” introduces two thematic categories: “Unified Text-to-Text Framework for NLP Tasks” and “Integration of Logical Reasoning and Mathematical Capabilities.” These collect prompting and reasoning techniques (e.g., prompt tuning [50], grammar prompting [19], chain-of-thought [46], AttendOut [48], multi-query attention/GQA [49]). While clear as technique groups, they are not tied to a telecom task taxonomy (e.g., RAN optimization, core network ops, OSS/BSS automation), making the classification feel more general-purpose than telecom-specific.\n  - The “Opportunities for AI in Telecommunications” section offers an application-oriented partition (“Network Optimization,” “Customer Service and User Interaction,” “Predictive Maintenance and Reliability,” “Automation and Efficiency”). This complements the lifecycle taxonomy but is not explicitly cross-referenced to it, so the mapping from techniques to application areas is left implicit.\n\n- Evolution of methodology: The paper mentions some historical and directional trends but does not systematically present an evolutionary path.\n  - The “Introduction Significance…” notes the “shift from statistical to neural language models” and the transition from 5G to 6G, as well as the move to open foundation models and edge offloading. However, these mentions are brief and not expanded into a stepwise evolution of methods or stages.\n  - Across sections, newer developments are named (e.g., instruction tuning/controllability, Chain-of-Thought [46], DRLHF [17]/DPO [75], parameter-efficient fine-tuning like QLoRA [59], edge/ split learning [8], RAG/prompt engineering in WirelessLLM [12,14]), but they are presented as a catalogue rather than a progression. There is no explicit chronology or staging (e.g., pretraining → fine-tuning → instruction tuning/RLHF → tool-use/RAG → multi-agent/agentic workflows → edge/efficient inference for telecom).\n  - The “Structure of the Survey” promises a flow “from foundational principles… to methodologies and dataset construction… to techniques… to opportunities… to challenges… to future directions,” which is a logical narrative, but within the core methodological sections the inheritance and connections between methods are not explicitly shown. For example, the paper does not explain how prompt tuning/grammar prompting evolved to address telecom-specific DSLs, or how edge split learning emerged in response to mobile constraints and how it changes the training/fine-tuning paradigm over time.\n  - Several places reference figures/tables that are not present (“As illustrated in ,” “Table …”), undermining the clarity of both classification and any intended evolutionary diagrams.\n\n- Specific points supporting the score:\n  - Clear classification examples:\n    - “Key Techniques for Implementing LLMs…” and its five subsections define a lifecycle-oriented taxonomy that is fairly clear and practical for deployment thinking.\n    - “Opportunities for AI in Telecommunications” organizes by application verticals (network optimization, customer service, predictive maintenance, automation), which reflects industry-facing groupings.\n  - Gaps in classification:\n    - “Unified Text-to-Text Framework for NLP Tasks” and “Integration of Logical Reasoning…” list many general LLM techniques (e.g., Zerocap [18], Meta-Transformer [41], AttendOut [48]) without consistently mapping them to telecom tasks or distinguishing telecom-unique adaptations, diluting the method taxonomy’s telecom specificity.\n    - Cross-domain methods (e.g., Zerocap image captioning; DF for website fingerprinting) are included alongside telecom items without an explicit taxonomy showing why they are relevant to telecom pipelines, which blurs categorization.\n  - Gaps in methodological evolution:\n    - The paper notes trends (“shift from statistical to neural…,” “edge offloading…,” “5G → 6G”) in the “Introduction” and “Future Directions,” but there is no systematic timeline or staged evolution explaining why and how methods changed, what bottlenecks prompted new techniques, or how telecom constraints shaped successive methodological innovations.\n    - The “Future Directions and Research Opportunities” section proposes refinements (e.g., automating grammar extraction [19], parameter-efficient tuning, expanding benchmarks like SPEC5G [5]) but does not tie them back to past stages and their limitations to show an evolutionary chain.\n\nOverall judgment:\n- The paper provides a partially clear set of method categories (especially the implementation lifecycle and application-oriented sections), but it mixes general LLM techniques with telecom applications without a unifying telecom-specific taxonomy and lacks an explicit, systematic evolution narrative. The result reflects some development trends but does not fully reveal the field’s progression or the inheritance between method families. Hence, a 3 is appropriate.", "2\n\nExplanation:\n- Diversity of datasets and metrics: The survey references datasets and metrics only at a very high level, with minimal specifics and few telecom-domain details. For example, in “Natural Language Processing (NLP)” it mentions “Comprehensive datasets, often comprising trillions of tokens, train large language models to perform complex tasks with high accuracy [23]” and “Metrics beyond mere accuracy ensure holistic evaluation of model capabilities and trade-offs [24],” but it does not name datasets, describe their scales, sources, modalities, or labeling methods. It similarly states “benchmarks specifically designed for the telecommunications domain” in “Interrelation of LLMs, NLP, and Telecommunications [40],” yet provides no concrete benchmark names, task definitions, or dataset characteristics. The one concrete benchmark described with any specificity is “benchmarks for Verilog code generation… emphasizing syntactic and functional testing” in “Unified Text-to-Text Framework for NLP Tasks [45],” which is peripheral to telecom and lacks details on dataset composition. Mentions of GLM-130B as a benchmark with “bilingual performance metrics” in “Opportunities for AI in Telecommunications [68]” and BERTScore in “Limitations in Model Performance and Evaluation” are brief and do not detail metric application or domain fit. Statements such as “Table provides a detailed examination of representative benchmarks…” and “Table offers a comparative overview…” appear multiple times (e.g., “Key Techniques for Implementing LLMs in Telecommunications” and “Limitations in Model Performance and Evaluation”), but the tables themselves are not present here and the narrative does not summarize their contents (no dataset names, sizes, splits, labels, or task definitions).\n- Rationality of datasets and metrics: The survey does include some reasonable metric considerations relevant to LLMs—e.g., “Metrics like Energy Cost and Inference Time clarify resource utilization during model inference [16]” in “Model Training and Optimization Strategies,” and mentions of alignment metrics such as “truthfulness and toxicity” in “Customer Service and User Interaction [54].” It also alludes to telecom performance outcomes (e.g., “lower delays and higher throughput for eMBB and URLLC slices” in “Predictive Maintenance and Reliability [35]”), but these are not framed as evaluation metrics for LLM experiments nor tied to specific datasets or experimental protocols. Crucially, the survey does not lay out telecom-appropriate datasets (e.g., RAN KPIs, NetFlow/PCAP traces, O-RAN xAPP logs, 3GPP protocol traces, UE mobility traces, beam management datasets) or describe their scales, labeling, and scenarios. Likewise, it does not systematically cover telecom-relevant metrics such as latency, throughput, packet loss, spectral efficiency, handover failure rate, slice SLA adherence, QoE measures, forecasting metrics (MSE/MAE/SMAPE), classification metrics (precision/recall/F1/AUC), or code generation evaluation (exact match, pass@k, functional correctness) in a way that links them to specific datasets and tasks. The few metric mentions (Energy/Inference time, cost efficiency in FrugalGPT [66], BERTScore, bilingual metrics in GLM-130B) are generic and not integrated into a consistent evaluation framework for telecom applications.\n- Supporting passages:\n  - “Comprehensive datasets, often comprising trillions of tokens, train large language models…” (NLP section) – generic scale reference without dataset names or telecom relevance.\n  - “Metrics beyond mere accuracy ensure holistic evaluation…” (NLP section) – vague, no metric list or application.\n  - “benchmarks specifically designed for the telecommunications domain” (Interrelation section [40]) – asserted but not detailed.\n  - “benchmarks for Verilog code generation… syntactic and functional testing…” (Unified Text-to-Text Framework [45]) – one concrete benchmark, but outside core telecom datasets; lacks dataset details.\n  - “Metrics like Energy Cost and Inference Time…” (Model Training and Optimization Strategies [16]) – useful but insufficient coverage.\n  - “GLM-130B… scalability and bilingual performance metrics” (Opportunities [68]) – brief, not telecom-specific.\n  - “Existing benchmarks like BERTScore may not encompass all aspects…” (Limitations) – metric named, but no broader metric framework provided.\n  - Multiple references to missing tables/figures: “Table provides a comparative overview…”, “Table provides a detailed examination…” – indicates intent but no accessible content in the provided text.\n\nGiven the absence of concrete dataset names, scales, labels, and application scenarios, and the limited, largely generic mention of metrics without telecom-specific coverage or rationalized selection, the section does not meet the criteria for comprehensive or even moderate coverage. Hence, a score of 2 is appropriate.", "Score: 2\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey compiles many methods and techniques relevant to LLMs in telecommunications, but it largely presents them as isolated items rather than as a systematic, multi-dimensional comparison. Across the sections after the Introduction (e.g., “Background and Definitions,” “Principles of Large Language Models in Telecommunications,” and “Key Techniques for Implementing LLMs in Telecommunications”), most discussions list methods with brief benefits, with limited explicit contrasting of architectures, objectives, assumptions, or trade-offs. Advantages and disadvantages are seldom juxtaposed across methods, and commonalities/distinctions are not synthesized into a coherent comparative framework.\n\nEvidence supporting this assessment:\n\n- Unified Text-to-Text Framework for NLP Tasks:\n  - The paper lists techniques without contrasting them across clear dimensions. For example: “Techniques such as prompt tuning adapt LLMs to telecom-specific language nuances, while grammar prompting improves text quality and relevance…”; “The FPT method supports versatile LLM deployment across modalities…”; “Collaborative frameworks, such as split learning systems (SLS-LLM)…,” “The Zerocap method…,” etc. These are descriptive mentions rather than a structured comparison of, for instance, prompt tuning vs. full fine-tuning vs. parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) in terms of data requirements, latency, robustness, or deployment constraints in telecom.\n\n- Integration of Logical Reasoning and Mathematical Capabilities:\n  - Several reasoning techniques are enumerated—“chain of thought prompting…,” “LM-Tutor…,” “GSM8K…,” “AttendOut…,” “Multi-query attention combined with multi-head attention…”—but there is no analysis of how these methods differ in assumptions (e.g., training-time vs. inference-time techniques), resource overhead, or suitability for telecom tasks with latency constraints. One partial comparative statement appears—“Prompt tuning emerges as a scalable approach that matches full model tuning performance as model size increases…”—but the survey does not expand this into a broader trade-off analysis (e.g., prompt tuning vs. adapters vs. LoRA vs. full fine-tuning across stability, catastrophic forgetting, or domain adaptation in telecom settings).\n\n- Data Processing and Multi-modal Integration:\n  - Again, methods are listed (Meta-Transformer, DF method, Zerocap, split learning, grammar prompting), but the survey does not contrast, for example, Meta-Transformer’s shared token space mapping vs. retrieval-augmented approaches or early/late fusion strategies, nor does it unpack their assumptions, data pairing requirements, or performance trade-offs in telecom-specific multimodal use cases.\n\n- Model Training and Optimization Strategies:\n  - The text notes “fine-tuning models using human feedback,” “interactive prompting,” “Chain of Thought prompting,” and mentions “metrics like Energy Cost and Inference Time,” but it does not systematically compare optimization paradigms (SFT, RLHF, DPO) across alignment stability, data demands, operational risk, or deployment cost in telecom. Claims such as “Chain of Thought prompting offers a structured approach…” are not contrasted with alternatives (e.g., self-consistency, Tree of Thought, program-of-thought) in a structured way.\n\n- System Integration and Deployment:\n  - The section mentions “NETBUDDY,” “TeraPipe,” and “UKM-DRL,” but there is no side-by-side comparison of deployment frameworks (e.g., pipeline-parallel training like TeraPipe vs. optimizer approaches like ZeRO vs. tensor/pipeline parallelism) concerning throughput, memory footprint, or communication overhead in telecom deployment contexts. Similarly, split learning is introduced elsewhere without comparing it to federated learning, on-device quantization/distillation, or edge offloading approaches under telecom latency and connectivity constraints.\n\n- Memory Optimization Techniques:\n  - Several techniques are noted—“ALBERT,” “QLoRA,” “ZeRO,” “Intra-layer model parallelism (ILMP)”—but their trade-offs are not compared (e.g., quantization accuracy vs. latency; ZeRO’s communication overhead vs. memory savings; parameter sharing vs. distillation; per-token latency impacts). The section summarizes individual benefits rather than contrasting them across consistent dimensions (memory savings, compute, accuracy impact, ease of integration, telecom deployment constraints).\n\n- Self-Attention Mechanisms and Overfitting:\n  - The section cites “AttendOut,” “Plan-and-Solve,” and high-level issues like “exponential degeneration of output rank,” but does not contrast attention variants (e.g., MQA vs. GQA vs. MHA) in terms of throughput, KV cache memory, or latency trade-offs—particularly important for telecom edge settings.\n\n- Challenges and Limitations; Limitations in Model Performance and Evaluation:\n  - These sections identify generic challenges (e.g., dependency on edge connectivity; specialized grammar creation; domain-specific pretraining needs) but do not tie them back to comparative evaluations of methods that address these challenges differently, nor do they provide a cross-method synthesis of pros/cons.\n\nOverall, while the survey is expansive and cites many methods, it falls short of a structured, technically grounded comparison across multiple meaningful dimensions (e.g., learning strategy, data dependency, scalability, latency/compute trade-offs, privacy, robustness) tailored to telecom applications. It mainly lists methods and attributes benefits in isolation, with minimal direct comparisons, limited treatment of disadvantages, and scarce discussion of underlying assumptions or architectural differences. Hence, a score of 2 is appropriate.", "Score: 3\n\nDetailed explanation:\nOverall, the section between the Introduction and later parts (notably “Background and Definitions,” “Interrelation of LLMs, NLP, and Telecommunications,” “Principles of Large Language Models in Telecommunications,” and “Key Techniques for Implementing LLMs in Telecommunications”) demonstrates basic analytical comments and some technically grounded observations, but the treatment is largely descriptive and lacks sustained reasoning about underlying mechanisms, design trade-offs, and assumptions across methods. There are occasional insightful statements (e.g., about self-attention biases and edge constraints), yet they are not developed into deeper comparative analyses. Below are concrete examples:\n\n1) Mostly descriptive listing without causal explanations or trade-offs\n- In “Unified Text-to-Text Framework for NLP Tasks,” methods are enumerated (prompt tuning, grammar prompting, FPT, Meta-Transformer, split learning), but the paper does not explain why one would prefer prompt tuning over full fine-tuning in telecom settings beyond a high-level resource rationale. For example: “Prompt tuning emerges as a scalable approach that matches full model tuning performance as model size increases, reducing resource requirements…” (Integration of Logical Reasoning and Mathematical Capabilities). There is no discussion of when/why this holds (e.g., sensitivity to task complexity, stability, or domain shift), what is lost vs. gained (catastrophic forgetting avoidance vs. limited task transfer), or telecom-specific constraints that might alter this trade-off.\n- Similarly, in “System Integration and Deployment,” TeraPipe is cited for “a 5.0x speedup” but without explaining the underlying mechanism (pipeline parallelism and schedule design), the bubble/throughput trade-offs, communication overheads, or how such techniques compare to tensor/sequence parallelism in telecom deployments.\n\n2) Limited technical causality despite naming mechanisms\n- “Self-Attention Mechanisms and Overfitting” briefly notes “self-attention networks… exhibit uniformity bias across tokens” and “exponential degeneration of output rank.” While these are technical insights, the paper stops short of explaining the mechanisms that cause rank degeneration, or how mitigation methods (e.g., AttendOut) change the learning dynamics, at what computational cost, and with what downstream impact on telecom workloads (e.g., long-context logs, streaming telemetry).\n- The attention-efficiency discussion (“Multi-query attention… GQA… improving efficiency”) is not accompanied by analysis of accuracy-latency-memory trade-offs (e.g., cache sharing benefits vs. potential quality regressions in long-context or multilingual settings), which are critical for telecom inference at the edge.\n\n3) Memory and efficiency techniques: listed but not compared systematically\n- “Memory Optimization Techniques” names ALBERT (“parameter sharing and factorized embedding”), QLoRA (“4-bit quantization plus LoRA”), ZeRO, and intra-layer model parallelism. While mechanisms are stated, the section does not probe the assumptions and limitations:\n  - ALBERT: no discussion of representation bottlenecks or when parameter sharing degrades performance on domain-specific tasks.\n  - QLoRA: no analysis of quantization-induced regressions in long-context or code-heavy tasks, calibration/outlier handling, or trade-offs between bit-width and QoS in telecom tasks.\n  - ZeRO: described as enabling larger training “without complex parallelism,” which glosses over the fact that ZeRO is itself a nuanced parallelism/memory-partitioning technique with communication and implementation complexity; no contrast to FSDP/DeepSpeed variants or their suitability under telecom infrastructure constraints.\n  - Absent is a decision framework (e.g., when to prefer quantization vs. parameter sharing vs. optimizer state partitioning for specific telecom workloads and latency budgets).\n\n4) Edge/telecom integration: high-level points without analytical depth\n- “Split learning systems enhance LLM performance in 6G networks by facilitating collaboration between mobile devices and edge servers” (Data Processing and Multi-modal Integration) and “dependency on edge server connectivity” (Technical Challenges) highlight relevant constraints, but do not analyze privacy-utility-latency trade-offs, communication overheads, failure modes under poor connectivity, or scheduler design for fluctuating radio conditions—key telecom-specific assumptions and trade-offs.\n- “Interrelation of LLMs, NLP, and Telecommunications” asserts synergy and categorization frameworks but does not synthesize how different adaptation strategies (e.g., RAG vs. instruction tuning vs. domain-specific pretraining vs. code-generation tool-use) compare under telecom data assumptions (proprietary standards, long-tail terminology, strict latency/availability SLAs).\n\n5) Limited cross-method synthesis and causal interpretation\n- Across sections (e.g., “Principles of LLMs in Telecommunications,” “Key Techniques…,” “Telecommunications Technology”), the narrative frequently uses bridging phrases (“These methodologies represent…,” “This integration highlights…”) but does not connect underlying mechanisms across research lines. For example, there is no explicit comparison of instruction tuning vs. retrieval-augmented generation for telecom knowledge grounding, nor a discussion of when fine-tuning is preferable to tool-mediated approaches (e.g., NETBUDDY-like config validation) given risk, auditability, and drift.\n- The survey cites “metrics like Energy Cost and Inference Time clarify resource utilization” (Model Training and Optimization Strategies) but does not interpret trade-offs quantitatively or explain how these metrics govern architecture/method choice in real telecom deployments.\n\n6) Challenges/limitations and ethics: generic rather than diagnostic\n- “Technical Challenges” and “Operational Challenges” list obstacles (edge connectivity, grammar prompting complexity, data heterogeneity) without exploring fundamental causes (e.g., domain shift, DSL ambiguity, idiosyncratic standards) or assessing the effectiveness/limits of proposed mitigations (e.g., domain-specific grammars vs. program synthesis, validation pipelines, secure retrieval).\n- “Ethical and Social Implications” names frameworks like Constitutional AI and DPO, but stops short of analyzing how feedback quality/bias propagates in telecom-specific tasks (e.g., provisioning policies, prioritization decisions), or how standardization should reflect sectoral regulation and audit needs.\n\nWhere the paper provides some analytical value:\n- The mention of “uniformity bias” and “exponential degeneration of output rank” (Self-Attention Mechanisms and Overfitting) reflects awareness of deeper model behavior.\n- The consistent thread around memory/compute constraints at the edge and the role of techniques like quantization, adapters, and split learning shows a useful (if high-level) alignment of method families to telecom constraints.\n- The paper points to domain adaptation needs (e.g., grammar prompting for DSLs, domain-specific fine-tuning like WirelessLLM) and recognizes challenges in instruction tuning and evaluation, albeit without a deeper comparative framework.\n\nGiven the balance of strengths and shortcomings, the review’s critical analysis rises above purely descriptive reporting but remains relatively shallow and uneven across methods. It does not consistently explain fundamental causes, trade-offs, or assumptions, and lacks integrative comparisons that interpret relationships across research lines. Therefore, a score of 3 is appropriate.", "4\n\nExplanation:\n\nOverall assessment:\n- The paper identifies a broad set of research gaps and future work across data, methods, systems, evaluation, and ethics, and it often connects those gaps to telecom-specific contexts (5G/6G, O-RAN, ISATNs, network slicing, edge deployment). However, many items are presented as lists with limited depth on root causes, prioritization, and concrete downstream impact on telecom KPIs (e.g., latency, reliability, OPEX/CAPEX). Hence, while the coverage is comprehensive, the depth of analysis is uneven, which is why this section merits 4 rather than 5.\n\nWhere the paper clearly identifies gaps and discusses their importance/impact:\n\n- Data and benchmarks\n  - “Limitations in Model Performance and Evaluation” explicitly notes the need for high‑quality, domain‑tailored datasets and more adaptable evaluation frameworks: “A significant challenge is the specificity of training data… High-quality datasets tailored to telecommunications applications’ unique requirements are needed.” It also highlights multilingual generalization issues: “Reliance on specific languages and language pairs… may restrict LLMs’ generalizability across diverse linguistic contexts,” and calls for domain‑specific pretraining akin to biomedical NLP to improve performance. Impact: without proper data/benchmarks, models won’t generalize to telecom languages and standards, undermining deployment.\n  - “Future Directions and Research Opportunities → Refinement and Optimization Techniques” calls for developing broader benchmarks, incorporating SPEC5G for protocol analysis to “reduce manual efforts,” and reducing inference energy costs—tying the gap to sustainability and practical toolability.\n\n- Methods and training\n  - “Future Directions and Research Opportunities → Refinement and Optimization Techniques” identifies method-level gaps: automating grammar extraction for complex DSLs, improving preference collection efficiency (DRLHP), stronger verifiers, parameter‑efficient fine‑tuning, prompt engineering, and optimized model parallelism. The rationale is provided (e.g., DSL grammars improve code robustness in network scenarios; efficient preference learning improves alignment).\n  - “Memory Optimization Techniques” details quantization (QLoRA), ZeRO, ILMP, and energy measurement/reduction during training/inference as necessary to make large models feasible for telecom workloads at the edge. The implied impact is operational viability in resource‑constrained environments.\n  - “Self‑Attention Mechanisms and Overfitting” points to overfitting/degeneration issues in attention and proposes AttendOut and structured reasoning (Plan‑and‑Solve) to improve robustness—important for reliability in safety‑critical network operations.\n\n- Systems/integration and edge deployment\n  - “Challenges and Limitations → Technical Challenges” names the dependency on edge server connectivity: “dependency on edge server connectivity… limits performance in areas with poor network coverage,” directly tying a system constraint to user‑visible performance impact.\n  - “Future Directions and Research Opportunities → Scalability and Adaptability” and “Integration and Application Expansion” emphasize scalable architectures, model/inference parallelism, and edge offloading, connecting these to dynamic traffic and heterogeneous service demands (e.g., network slicing). Impact: better responsiveness and resilience under varying loads.\n  - “System Integration and Deployment” and references to TeraPipe/NETBUDDY identify gaps in validating LLM‑generated configurations and accelerating large‑scale training—critical for safe and timely deployment.\n\n- Evaluation and safety\n  - “Limitations in Model Performance and Evaluation” argues current metrics (e.g., BERTScore) and methods (FPT) may miss task‑specific performance aspects, advocating comprehensive evaluation across telecom tasks (terminology, taxonomy, continuity, robustness).\n  - “Ethical and Social Implications” and “Ethical Implications and Standardization” highlight transparency, bias, and the quality of human feedback (Constitutional AI, DPO), linking these to trustworthiness and fairness—key for telecom service delivery and regulatory compliance.\n\n- Domain‑specific application gaps\n  - “Objectives of the Survey” and “Future Directions…” stress instruction‑tuning gaps for telecom tasks, and the need to adapt LLMs to telecom languages (e.g., identifying 3GPP working groups) and to automate 5G protocol analysis (SPEC5G). The impact—reduced manual effort and improved operator efficiency—is stated.\n  - “Integration and Application Expansion” and “Emerging Trends and Collaborative Efforts” point to integrating LLMs into ISATNs and WirelessLLM for wireless domain knowledge alignment/fusion/evolution, with the goal of intent‑driven, self‑evolving networks—articulating strategic industry impact.\n\nWhere the section falls short in depth:\n\n- Many future‑work items are presented as catalogs (e.g., parameter‑efficient fine‑tuning, prompt engineering, model parallelism, edge collaboration) without deeper causal analysis of why current techniques fail in telecom, how to measure progress, or how these gaps map to concrete telecom KPIs (e.g., URLLC reliability, beam management latency, slice isolation).\n- Limited prioritization or risk analysis. For instance, the operational risks of hallucinations in configuration/code generation, and mitigation strategies (e.g., constrained decoding, formal verification, RAG over vetted KBs) are not deeply examined despite being alluded to (e.g., grammar prompting, NETBUDDY).\n- Data governance and regulatory constraints (privacy, lawful intercept, cross‑border data flows) are not analyzed beyond general bias/transparency themes, even though they critically impact dataset creation, training, and deployment in telecom environments.\n- The multilingual/terminology gap is mentioned, but there’s little detail on concrete dataset creation strategies (e.g., mining 3GPP specs/GSMA/ETSI corpora, handling version drift), or on robustness to noisy operational logs and multimodal telemetry.\n- While evaluation limitations are recognized, the paper stops short of proposing detailed telecom‑specific benchmark task suites with metrics tied to operational outcomes (e.g., mean time to resolution, configuration error rate, energy per inference at RAN/edge).\n\nSpecific supporting parts:\n\n- “Challenges and Limitations → Technical Challenges”: identifies edge connectivity dependency; pre‑trained model caption inaccuracies; DSL grammar burden; need for domain adaptation (WirelessLLM). These illustrate concrete gaps and why they matter.\n- “Challenges and Limitations → Operational Challenges”: integration complexity with existing architectures; real‑time adaptation; data heterogeneity; edge resource constraints and reliance on edge servers—connecting gaps to deployment feasibility.\n- “Challenges and Limitations → Ethical and Social Implications”: calls out transparency (Constitutional AI), biases, and human feedback quality (DPO), linking to trust and fairness impacts.\n- “Limitations in Model Performance and Evaluation”: telecom‑specific data scarcity; multilingual generalization; need for domain pretraining; inadequacy of generic metrics—clear evaluation gaps and implications for reliability.\n- “Future Directions and Research Opportunities → Refinement and Optimization Techniques”: proposals on automating DSL grammar extraction, improving DRLHP preference collection, parameter‑efficient tuning, model parallelism, and protocol analysis automation (SPEC5G)—actionable directions addressing identified gaps.\n- “Future Directions and Research Opportunities → Scalability and Adaptability”: emphasizes scalable architectures and efficient inference/model parallelism in distributed/edge settings—critical for real‑world telecom scalability.\n- “Future Directions and Research Opportunities → Integration and Application Expansion”: expansion to ISATNs, edge split learning, network slicing—clarifying application domains where gaps remain.\n- “Future Directions and Research Opportunities → Ethical Implications and Standardization”: standardization needs for bias and transparency—tying ethical gaps to deployability.\n\nConclusion:\nThe paper substantially identifies and organizes key research gaps and proposes future directions across data, methods, systems, evaluation, and ethics, often with telecom‑specific context. However, analyses are often high‑level, with limited depth on causal mechanisms, concrete metrics, and prioritization of impact, preventing a top score.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe paper clearly identifies concrete research gaps and real-world constraints and proposes multiple forward-looking directions that respond to these gaps. However, while the directions are generally well aligned with telecom needs and contain some specific, innovative topics, the analysis of their academic/practical impact and the implementation path is often brief and high-level, which keeps this from a top score.\n\nEvidence that gaps/real-world issues are identified:\n- Challenges and Limitations – Technical Challenges: “A critical issue is the dependency on edge server connectivity, which limits performance in areas with poor network coverage [8].” and “Developing specialized grammars for grammar prompting methods presents a significant hurdle, especially for complex domain-specific languages (DSLs) [19]…” These pinpoint deployment bottlenecks at the edge and domain adaptation burdens.\n- Challenges and Limitations – Operational Challenges: “Integrating LLMs with existing network architectures is complex, requiring substantial modifications to meet computational demands [2].” and “Real-time processing and rapid adaptation to dynamic network conditions further complicate operations… [10].” These map directly to real-world RAN/core constraints and latency requirements.\n- Challenges and Limitations – Ethical and Social Implications: “A key ethical issue is the transparency of AI decision-making processes… [74]” and “Reliance on human feedback… may introduce limitations due to feedback quality [75].” These frame responsible AI deployment needs in telecom.\n- Limitations in Model Performance and Evaluation: “A significant challenge is the specificity of training data… [52]” and “Reliance on specific languages… may restrict LLMs’ generalizability… [68].” These highlight domain transfer and multilingual needs typical in global operators.\n\nEvidence that forward-looking directions address these gaps and real-world needs:\n- Future Directions and Research Opportunities – Refinement and Optimization Techniques:\n  - “Automating grammar extraction and expanding methods to support diverse domain-specific languages (DSLs) can significantly improve LLM adaptability in networking contexts [19].” This is a concrete, novel direction aimed at reducing the DSL authoring burden for telecom command/config languages.\n  - “Incorporating diverse datasets, like SPEC5G, enhances LLM applicability in 5G protocol analysis, automating analysis and security… [5].” This ties LLM refinement to a real telecom task (protocol analysis) and suggests dataset-driven automation.\n  - “Fine-tuning LLMs for telecom-specific language improves identification of 3GPP standard working groups…” This is a specific application-level direction aligned with operator standards workflows.\n  - “Optimizing model parallelism and alternative architectures for training large models…” and “Developing benchmarks covering more models and tasks, and reducing energy costs in inference…” address resource and evaluation gaps (edge constraints, energy efficiency) identified earlier.\n- Scalability and Adaptability:\n  - “Implementing scalable architectures… Techniques like model parallelism and efficient inference strategies enable effective operation across distributed infrastructures… [78].” This directly responds to operational constraints and edge/cloud distribution.\n  - “Integrating LLMs with advanced network management frameworks… enabling task-specific code generation from natural language queries and addressing challenges like explainability, scalability, and privacy.” This maps to intent-based operations and practical operator needs (explainability, privacy).\n- Integration and Application Expansion:\n  - “Deploying LLMs in Intelligent Satellite Network Systems (ISATNs)… [41],” “LLM application expansion in network slicing… [10],” and “Integrating LLMs into edge computing environments… [8].” These are concrete domains with clear real-world value (global coverage, heterogeneous slices, edge inference).\n  - “Deploying LLMs in predictive maintenance applications… leveraging frameworks like Tree of Thought (ToT)… [79].” This ties a research technique to an operational KPI (uptime/downtime reduction).\n- Emerging Trends and Collaborative Efforts:\n  - “Developing open and efficient foundation models… [3]” and “Integrating LLMs into cloud-native applications, where they generate cloud configurations [2].” These directions support democratization and DevOps alignment in telecom.\n  - “Efficient Parallel Split Learning (EPSL)… integrating edge computing with parallel split learning [8].” Direct response to the earlier edge-connectivity and resource constraints.\n- Ethical Implications and Standardization:\n  - “Establishing ethical standards mitigates biases… Ensuring transparency… Frameworks like Constitutional AI… [74],” and “addressing the quality and bias of human feedback… [75].” These propose standardization and governance aligned with telecom compliance needs.\n\nInnovation and specificity:\n- The paper proposes specific, novel topics such as automating grammar extraction for telecom DSLs, SPEC5G-driven LLMs for 5G protocol analysis, natural-language-to-code for network management, and ISATN integrations. These are more actionable than generic calls for “more research.”\n- It also recommends concrete efficiency avenues (e.g., parameter-efficient fine-tuning, model parallelism, energy-aware inference), directly tied to edge/operational constraints.\n\nWhy not a 5:\n- The discussion of impact and feasibility is often brief. For example, while “automating grammar extraction” and “task-specific code generation” are promising, the paper does not delineate concrete methodologies, validation protocols, or risk mitigation (e.g., safety guardrails for auto-generated network changes, human-in-the-loop workflows).\n- Prioritization and quantitative KPIs are missing; directions are numerous but not ranked by operator value or difficulty. Ethical standardization suggestions are general (transparency, bias mitigation) without telecom-specific standards mapping (e.g., 3GPP/ETSI/O-RAN processes).\n- Several directions (prompt engineering, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, benchmark expansion) are well-known in generic LLM literature; the paper could better articulate telecom-specific novelty and pathways to deployment.\n\nOverall, the section convincingly links gaps to forward-looking, real-world-relevant research directions, with several specific and innovative topics. The limited depth in impact analysis and implementation detail prevents a perfect score."]}

For example: “this work presents a comprehensive survey of LLM-enabled telecom networks” and “this work provides a comprehensive survey on fundamentals, key techniques, and applications of LLM-enabled telecom.” It further delineates scope through precise terminology definitions: “‘foundation models’ refers to models… beyond pure language-related tasks… while ‘LLM-enabled’ or ‘LLM-aided’ approaches denote methods that repurpose existing pre-trained language models for telecom tasks.” It also clarifies that “when referring to LLMs, it means that the inputs to the model are purely text… When discussing the multi-modal inputs, we explicitly describe them as multi-modal large language models or multi-modal LLMs.”\n- Structured focus areas: The Introduction lists six concrete topical pillars: “LLM fundamentals,” “generation,” “classification,” “optimization,” “prediction,” and “challenges and future directions.” The paper reiterates the intended structure: “The rest of this paper is organized as Fig. fig1” and maps each section (e.g., Sections sec-gene, sec-class, sec-optimize, sec-predict) to these objectives. This provides readers with a precise roadmap of what the survey will cover.\n- Positioning and contributions: The paper differentiates itself from prior surveys in the “Related Surveys” discussion and in the Introduction: it claims broader coverage (“from model architecture, pre-training, fine-tuning, inference and utilization, and evaluation, to deployment”), and uniquely emphasizes LLM-inspired techniques (e.g., reward design for RL, black-box optimization, time-series LLMs) and telecom deployments (cloud, edge, on-device). It states, “This work covers nearly 20 telecom application scenarios… aiming to be a roadmap.”\n\nWhy not 5/5: There is no Abstract provided in the supplied text. For a literature survey, the Abstract is the primary place to state the objective succinctly, delimit scope, and foreground contributions. Its absence reduces upfront clarity. In addition, while the objectives are comprehensive and repeated, they could be distilled into a single, concise statement early on. Finally, boundaries such as inclusion/exclusion criteria, time window of the literature, and explicit research questions are not clearly stated in the Introduction; adding those would further sharpen objective clarity.\n\n2) Background and Motivation\n- Strong, well-argued background: The Introduction thoroughly motivates the problem by linking 6G targets and complexity to management challenges: “6G networks are expected to achieve terabits per second… connection densities… and lower than 0.1 ms latency… such highly integrated network architecture and functions may lead to a huge burden on 6G network management.” It situates prior AI/ML work in telecom (RL for network management, CSI prediction, federated learning) and contrasts with the new opportunities and gaps of LLMs: “LLM technologies have many promising features… Existing studies have shown that LLMs can answer telecom-domain questions, generate troubleshooting reports, develop project code, and configure networks… However… applying a general-domain LLM directly to telecom tasks may lead to poor performance… fine-tuning… requires [careful] dataset collection… many telecom tasks require multi-step planning.”\n- Clear rationale for a comprehensive survey now: The text stresses rapid progress and fragmentation of prior work (“Existing studies… focus on one specific aspect”), justifying a broader, structured survey that integrates fundamentals, techniques, and applications.\n\n3) Practical Significance and Guidance Value\n- Practicality and guidance are emphasized: The objectives translate into actionable guidance—e.g., deployment strategies (“central cloud, network edge, on-device”), concrete techniques (instruction/alignment tuning, CoT, planning, self-refinement), and application categories mapped to telecom use cases (generation: coding, troubleshooting, configuration; classification: security, text/image/traffic; optimization: reward design, verbal RL, convex, heuristic; prediction: time-series foundation models and multi-modality).\n- The paper explicitly positions itself as a “roadmap” and claims detailed, engineering-oriented coverage: “For each application, this work provides technical details such as framework, pre-training steps, and prompt designs,” and “aiming to be a roadmap for researchers to use LLMs to solve various telecom tasks.” This indicates strong guidance value for both researchers and practitioners.\n\nAreas to improve for a 5/5:\n- Provide an Abstract that crisply states objective, scope, novelty, and key contributions.\n- Add explicit research questions and survey methodology (literature search scope, inclusion/exclusion criteria, time horizon), which would tighten the objective and make the guidance even more actionable.\n- Clean minor formatting/citation issues in the Introduction that occasionally distract from clarity.\n\nOverall, despite the missing Abstract, the Introduction articulates a clear, specific objective, provides strong motivation, and sets out a practical roadmap—hence 4/5.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\n- Method Classification Clarity: The paper presents a clear and well-structured taxonomy that is easy to follow. After the Introduction, it lays out “LLM Fundamentals” (Sections on Model Architecture, Pre-training, Fine-tuning, Inference via Prompting, Evaluation, and Deployment), followed by four application-driven pillars: Generation, Classification, Optimization, and Prediction. This categorization is explicitly motivated and justified (e.g., the footnote in the Introduction notes that although classification/optimization/prediction ultimately rely on LLM’s generation, separating them “can significantly reduce the reader’s difficulty in understanding the LLM’s potential for telecom applications”). Each fundamental subcategory is further defined:\n  - Model architecture: encoder-only, encoder–decoder, and decoder-only (LLM Fundamentals → Model Architecture).\n  - Pre-training: dataset collection, preprocessing, and scalable training techniques like 3D parallelism and ZeRO (LLM Fundamentals → Pre-training).\n  - Fine-tuning: instruction tuning and alignment tuning (including RLHF and DPO, and alternatives such as Constitutional AI and RLAIF) (LLM Fundamentals → Fine-tuning).\n  - Prompting: ICL → CoT → Planning → Self-refinement (LLM Fundamentals → Inference and Utilization by Prompting, and Fig. fig-prompting).\n  - Deployment: cloud, edge, on-device, cache-based, and cooperative (LLM Fundamentals → Deployment in Telecom Networks and Table tab-deploy).\n  This hierarchy is consistently applied in later sections where each application area is broken down into concrete subtopics (e.g., Generation: domain knowledge, code, network configuration; Classification: security, text, image, encrypted traffic; Optimization: RL reward design and verbal RL, black-box, convex, heuristic; Prediction: pre-trained foundation models, frozen LLMs via hard/soft prompting and preprocessing, fine-tuned LLMs with LoRA/LNT, multi-modality). The summaries and tables (e.g., Table tab-llm-generation, Table tab-class-summary, Table tab-summary-opt, and Table tab-mlsummary) reinforce the clarity by listing features, requirements, advantages, and telecom opportunities.\n\n- Evolution of Methodology: The paper generally shows method evolution and trends, particularly within the LLM fundamentals and prediction sections:\n  - It traces the transformer backbone and architectural variants (encoder-only → encoder–decoder → decoder-only) and explains why causal attention is more natural for time-series forecasting (LLM Fundamentals → Model Architecture).\n  - It presents a progression in fine-tuning from supervised instruction tuning to alignment tuning, discussing shifts from RLHF to DPO and the emergence of Constitutional AI/RLAIF to reduce dependence on costly human preference data (LLM Fundamentals → Fine-tuning).\n  - In prompting, there is a clear evolution from ICL to CoT prompting, then to planning for complex tasks, and finally to self-refinement (LLM Fundamentals → Inference and Utilization by Prompting; Fig. fig-prompting).\n  - Deployment trends are discussed from cloud-centric to edge and on-device, with hybrid cache-based and cooperative schemes that reflect practical constraints and telecom latency demands (LLM Fundamentals → Deployment).\n  - In optimization, the survey highlights a shift from manual RL reward design to LLM-automated reward design (Song et al., Kwon et al., Eureka), the emergence of verbal reinforcement learning where LLM acts as an agent, and exploration of LLM-enabled convex optimization assistance and heuristic algorithm generation (LLM-enabled Optimization Techniques; Table tab-llm-optimization and related subsections). This shows evolution from traditional RL/convex/heuristic pipelines toward LLM-assisted and LLM-driven methods.\n  - The prediction section is especially systematic in presenting an evolutionary pipeline: (1) pre-training foundation models for zero-shot forecasting (e.g., TimeGPT, TimesFM; encoder–decoder vs decoder-only), (2) frozen pre-trained LLMs via hard prompts, soft prompts, and preprocessing (LLMTIME), (3) parameter-efficient fine-tuning for time series (LoRA, LNT; LLM4TS, FITS), and (4) multi-modal LLMs aligned with 6G sensing trends (Prediction → Pre-training Foundation Models; Frozen Pre-trained LLM; Fine-tuned LLM Prediction; Multi-modal LLM for Telecom Prediction; Figs. fig-prediction, fig-prediction-decoder, fig-llm4ts, fig-multi-moda). This sequence reveals the methodological trajectory from general models to telecom-specialized approaches and to richer multi-modal integration.\n\n- Reasons for not scoring 5: While the classification is very clear and the evolution is largely presented, the paper does not consistently provide a chronological or stage-wise evolution narrative within each application area (e.g., Generation and Classification sections focus on topical breadth and capability rather than explicitly tracing historical development paths in telecom). The “Related Surveys” section (Table tab1 and the discussion) strongly contrasts coverage breadth across existing surveys but less explicitly maps a timeline or stages of methodological progression in telecom. Also, connections between some categories (e.g., how specific telecom subdomains transitioned across model generations in practice) are implied rather than systematically detailed.\n\nOverall, the survey excels at structuring the field and surfacing current methodological trends, especially in fundamentals, optimization, and prediction. Minor gaps in explicit evolutionary staging across all application sections prevent a top score, hence a 4.", "Score: 4\n\nDetailed explanation:\n\n- Diversity of datasets and metrics:\n  - The survey covers a broad set of datasets relevant to telecom-focused LLM work and explicitly consolidates them in the table “Summary of Telecom datasets for LLM” (near the end of the paper). That table lists multiple datasets spanning tasks such as summarization (5GSum, Tspec-LLM), question answering (TeleQnA, NetEval, TeleQuAD, StandardsQA, ORAN-Bench-13K), and sentence classification (5GSC), and provides document counts, question counts, and open-source availability. This directly supports diversity and breadth in dataset coverage.\n  - Beyond the summary table, the text references further domain datasets:\n    - Domain knowledge generation: MS MARCO document ranking dataset (bajaj2016ms) is discussed in the troubleshooting generation pipeline in Fig. fig-gene-answer and accompanying description, highlighting a general QA corpus used for ranking and retrieval in telecom troubleshooting settings.\n    - Security/attack detection: The EdgeIIoTset dataset (9751703) is used to build SecurityBERT (ferrag2024revolutionizing), with detailed class taxonomy (DoS/DDoS, MITM, injection, malware) and a description of how raw features are converted to text for LLM training.\n    - Encrypted traffic classification: Multiple datasets and tasks are cited and used, e.g., ISCX VPN (sirinam2018deep), FlowPrint (van2020flowprint), and a VPN characterization dataset (draper2016characterization) to demonstrate BERT-BiLSTM and ET-BERT.\n    - Configuration generation: CloudEval-YAML is presented as a benchmark for YAML configurations; NETBUDDY’s evaluation on an emulator is described; VPP leverages Batfish for verification feedback.\n  - Evaluation metrics are covered systematically in the dedicated subsection “Evaluation metrics of LLM.” That section discusses:\n    - Accuracy and benchmark-based evaluation.\n    - Hallucination and factual consistency, with explicit mention of ROUGE (lin2004rouge), BERTScore (zhang2019bertscore), and newer hallucination metrics (AlignScore in zha2023alignscore).\n    - Efficiency (energy usage, latency, hardware costs), citing sustainability and carbon cost work (samsi2023words, faiz2023llmcarbon) and data efficiency (mcdonald2022great).\n    - Human alignment and manual evaluation, grounded in human preference/ethics literature (chang2023survey; zieims2024can; liang2022holistic).\n  - The application sections further report standard task metrics:\n    - Security/attack detection: Accuracy, recall, and F1-score for SecurityBERT (“average accuracy, recall, and F1-score of 0.98, 0.84, and 0.84”).\n    - Encrypted traffic classification: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 (“BERT-BiLSTM … achieving an overall accuracy of 99.70%, precision of 99.34%, recall of 99.51%, and F1-score of 99.43%”).\n    - Code generation: Repair rate percentages and impact on coding time (“repaired 86.71% … few-shot examples raise to 96.50%”; “reduced coding time by 65.16% and 68.44%”).\n    - Optimization: Success rates and normalized improvement (“outperforms human experts on 83% of the tasks … average normalized improvement of 52%”; success rate ~0.8 in LP/MILP).\n  - Collectively, these support that the survey spans multiple datasets and metrics types across QA, classification, configuration, security, traffic classification, and optimization.\n\n- Rationality of datasets and metrics:\n  - The paper explicitly motivates why certain metrics matter in telecom contexts. In “Evaluation metrics of LLM,” it ties efficiency and latency to telecom operational constraints and sustainability; it also highlights hallucination risks and the importance of factual consistency for domain reliability.\n  - In “LLM Deployment in Telecom Networks,” the discussion of latency constraints and inference time (0.58 to 90 seconds) reinforces why efficiency metrics are practically meaningful for telecom applications (URLLC, edge/cloud trade-offs).\n  - For classification tasks, the choice of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 is academically standard and practically relevant (e.g., attack detection, encrypted traffic classification). The survey provides dataset-task pairing and sensible metrics for each (e.g., ISCX VPN and ET-BERT evaluated on multiple downstream tasks).\n  - For security datasets, EdgeIIoTset is appropriate for telecom/IoT attack detection and the paper explains tokenization and textual transformation to fit LLM workflows—showing methodological rationality.\n  - For configuration generation, the use of verifiers (Batfish) and emulator-based evaluation in NETBUDDY shows practically grounded evaluation strategies (syntax, semantics, policy correctness), which is highly relevant to operators.\n\n- Areas for improvement (reasons the score is not 5):\n  - While the dataset table is valuable, descriptions are relatively shallow; most entries lack details on labeling methodology, splits, modality coverage, or licensing constraints. For example, 5GSum/Tspec-LLM are listed with document counts but without clear annotation schemes or segment granularity; QA datasets list question counts but not answer types, provenance, or train/test splits.\n  - The survey gives limited coverage of multimodal telecom datasets (images/videos/LiDAR) that would be relevant to the multi-modal LLM prediction and classification sections (e.g., vision-aided beamforming and blockage detection). The multi-modal prediction section motivates the need but does not enumerate or detail corresponding public datasets in telecom.\n  - In time-series prediction, the survey does not standardize or exemplify common forecasting metrics like RMSE, MAE, sMAPE, MASE, or CRPS in its evaluation discussion; references to prediction model performance are more conceptual than metric-driven. Similarly, code generation metrics beyond repair rate and task success (e.g., HumanEval/MBPP pass@k, compilation rate, runtime correctness) are referenced tangentially but not organized into a metric framework for telecom tasks.\n  - Some benchmarks are mentioned (CloudEval-YAML, HumanEval, GSM8K, Big-Bench Hard), but their metric definitions or how they translate to telecom relevance are not fully elaborated.\n\nOverall, the paper includes multiple datasets and a meaningful set of evaluation metrics with telecom-specific rationale (particularly for accuracy, hallucination, efficiency, and human alignment). It also reports standard classification metrics in its application sections. The main limitations are the depth of dataset descriptions (labeling/splits/modality), limited cataloguing of multimodal telecom datasets, and the absence of a consolidated metric framework for prediction tasks and code/configuration generation. Hence, a score of 4 is appropriate.", "Score: 5\n\nExplanation:\nThe paper provides a systematic, well-structured, and technically grounded comparison of methods across multiple meaningful dimensions, meeting the criteria for a top score.\n\n- Comparison of LLM architectures (Section “Model Architecture”): The paper clearly contrasts encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only designs, explaining differences in attention mechanisms (bidirectional vs. causal), typical task fit (understanding vs. generation), and representative models (e.g., BERT, T5/BART, GPT/PaLM/LLaMA). Examples include: “Models with an encoder-only structure… are tailored for language understanding tasks…” and “Decoder-only architectures specialize in unidirectional attention… Causal decoders are predominantly adopted in popular LLMs…” This section goes beyond listing by explaining technical assumptions and implications for telecom use.\n\n- Prompting techniques (Section “LLM Inference and Utilization by Prompting”): The paper distinguishes ICL, CoT, planning, and self-refinement, explaining mechanisms, strengths, and limitations. It notes, for instance, “ICL… utilizes formatted natural language prompts… The design of demonstrations is critical…” and “CoT… faces challenges such as incorrect reasoning and instability… enhancement strategies include… verification-based methods.” The planning component is decomposed into “task planner,” “plan executor,” and “environment,” and self-refinement is described with actionable feedback loops. These are comparative along learning strategy and robustness dimensions.\n\n- Deployment strategies (Section “LLM Deployment in Telecom Networks” and Table “Summary of LLM deployment strategies”): The paper systematically compares cloud, edge, on-device, cache-based, and cooperative deployments, detailing features and trade-offs (latency, bandwidth, resource constraints, coordination complexity). Examples include: “Cloud deployment… provides abundant computational resources… [but] higher end-to-end latency… and extra bandwidth costs,” versus “Network edge deployment… shorten the response time… [but] limited computational and storage capacities… techniques… parameter-efficient fine-tuning, split edge learning, quantized training.” The cooperative model (“EdgeFM”) is contrasted with specific performance gains (“3.2x lower latency, 34.3% accuracy improvement”), providing rigorous, application-grounded comparison.\n\n- Related surveys (Section “Related Surveys” and the comparison table): The paper contrasts prior surveys across coverage dimensions (fundamentals, deployment, multi-modality, applications), explicitly identifying gaps (e.g., “chain-of-thought and step-by-step planning are not discussed in many existing studies”), and distinguishing its contributions (broader topic coverage and application depth). This is a structured comparison of prior work’s scope and assumptions.\n\n- Optimization techniques (Section “LLM-enabled Optimization Techniques” and Table “Summary of LLM-aided Optimization Techniques Studies”): The paper compares multiple families—LLM-aided RL (automatic reward design vs. verbal RL), black-box optimizers, convex optimization, and heuristic design—along objectives, inputs/prompts, advantages, and limitations. It states, for instance, “Automatic reward function design can significantly save human effort… [but] is still at a very early stage,” “Verbal reinforcement learning… avoids the difficulty of tuning hyperparameters… allows for language instructions… provides interpretable explanations,” and “Black-box optimization avoids the complexity of building dedicated optimization models… [but] performance cannot be guaranteed.” The convex optimization subsection details differences in problem transformation and solver integration (“diagnose infeasibility… generate code… call the solver… rerun tests”), while heuristic design is broken into staged prompt-driven synthesis and reasoning. The summary table further contrasts these methods across advantages, issues, and telecom applicability—demonstrating depth and clarity.\n\n- Prediction methods (Section “Time Series LLM for Prediction Problems” and Table “Summary of LLM-based Prediction for Telecom”): The paper compares pre-trained foundation models vs. frozen LLMs (hard/soft prompting vs. preprocessing), fine-tuned LLMs (LoRA/LNT), and multi-modal prediction. It explains architectural choices (encoder-decoder vs. decoder-only, with causal attention’s suitability for time series) and tokenization (“patching to reduce input tokens”). It presents concrete telecom-oriented hard prompt templates (e.g., traffic, users, customer service), and discusses preprocessing trade-offs (“introducing extra space” and “eliminating decimal points”). The fine-tuning discussion is technically precise (LoRA update W’ = W + AB, and where to apply), and the multi-modal section ties sensing and prediction in 6G contexts (CSI, mmWave/THz beamforming, traffic load, QoE), contrasting single-modality methods with multi-modal LLM advantages.\n\nOverall, the paper consistently:\n- Compares methods across architecture, learning strategy, deployment, data/tokenization, and application scenarios.\n- Clearly articulates advantages and disadvantages and identifies commonalities and distinctions.\n- Grounds differences in technical assumptions and objectives (e.g., attention type, inference latency, resource constraints, training strategy).\n- Avoids superficial listing by providing structured tables and detailed narratives (e.g., pros/cons, input requirements, potential issues, telecom-specific opportunities).\n\nMinor areas where comparisons occasionally remain at a higher level (e.g., some generation/classification tables largely list studies and findings) do not detract from the overall rigor and breadth of comparative analysis across the core methodological sections.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey provides meaningful, technically grounded analysis across methods and deployment choices, and often goes beyond description to discuss underlying mechanisms, trade-offs, and limitations. However, the depth is uneven—some parts are richly analytical while others remain largely descriptive or aspirational. Below are specific instances that support this score.\n\n- Related Surveys (Section “Related Surveys”):\n  - The paper clearly identifies gaps in prior surveys and explains why those gaps matter. For example, it notes that “prompt engineering is of great importance… but some crucial techniques such as chain-of-thought (CoT) and step-by-step planning are not discussed in many existing studies,” and highlights novel directions (e.g., reward design and time-series LLMs) “not mentioned in most existing studies.” This is interpretive commentary that positions the work meaningfully within the literature rather than merely listing prior work.\n  - It synthesizes across research lines, e.g., noting multi-modality is discussed in some studies but “not from the prediction perspective,” thereby clarifying where the current survey extends the discourse.\n\n- LLM Fundamentals:\n  - Model architecture (Subsection “Model Architecture”):\n    - The differences among encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only models are explained with causal vs bidirectional attention and cross-attention, linking architecture choices to task suitability. This evidences underlying mechanisms rather than surface descriptions (“Causal decoders… allowing each token to attend only to its past tokens and itself”; “non-causal decoders resemble encoder-decoder frameworks”).\n  - Fine-tuning (Subsection “LLM Fine-tuning”):\n    - Clear trade-offs and limitations are articulated: “RLHF can be computationally intensive and complex” and “DPO… eliminates the need for a reward model… [but] both RLHF and DPO depend on high-quality human preference data.” The discussion of Constitutional AI and RLAIF addresses practical constraints (limited/expensive human feedback) and proposes mechanism-driven alternatives (AI feedback generation).\n  - Prompt engineering (Subsection “LLM Inference and Utilization by Prompting”):\n    - The paper doesn’t just list techniques; it explains when and why they work. For ICL, it analyzes demonstration selection/format/order and the underlying mechanisms (“task recognition” vs “task learning,” with larger LLMs showing enhanced demonstration learning). For CoT, it details benefits on “complex reasoning tasks” and acknowledges challenges (“incorrect reasoning and instability”), proposing strategies like verification and tree-structured reasoning. It also notes CoT’s scaling behavior (“significantly benefits large-scale LLMs (over 10B parameters)” but “may underperform in simpler tasks”).\n  - Evaluation metrics:\n    - The critique of common metrics (ROUGE, BERTScore) for factual consistency and mention of hallucination-specific metrics (AlignScore) reflect technical awareness of evaluation limitations. Efficiency and environmental cost (“LLM expands… issues regarding environmental sustainability”) are explicitly recognized with implications for telecom deployment.\n\n- Deployment analysis (Subsection “LLM Deployment in Telecom Networks” and Table “Summary of LLM deployment strategies”):\n  - The paper provides a strong trade-off analysis across cloud, edge, on-device, cache-based, and cooperative deployment, discussing latency, bandwidth, storage/compute constraints, and coordination overhead (“quantized parameters in the edge cloud… frozen parameters at user devices” and the need for “complicated coordination… update/synchronization frequency”). These are operationally grounded, telecom-specific arguments rather than generalities.\n\n- Application-focused critical analyses:\n  - Generation (Section “LLM for Generation Problems in Wireless Networks”):\n    - The authors are not merely optimistic; they flag reliability risks and validation needs: “the models may generate misleading or even wrong solutions… verification is crucial,” with reasons tied to “different data sources, training strategies.” This acknowledges failure modes and required mitigations.\n  - Classification (Section “LLM-enabled Classification Problems”):\n    - Security and attack detection analysis explains why general-domain LLMs may underperform (“security language… differs… making it challenging to understand specialized vocabulary”) and motivates security-specific tokenizers and corpora (SecureBERT). It also surfaces an important assumption and vulnerability in pre-training for traffic classification: “assumption of clean pre-training data… attackers craft a poisoned model with backdoors by inserting low-frequency words,” linking a concrete mechanism (toxic embeddings) to a failure mode.\n  - Optimization (Section “LLM-enabled Optimization Techniques for telecom”):\n    - Reward function design: The survey explains the fundamental difficulty (trial-and-error, unintended behaviors) and proposes a structured LLM-based formulation with explicit components (task/objective/states/actions/examples, mapping function M) and iterative feedback/self-refinement loops, articulating the mechanism of improvement. It also candidly notes constraints (“very early stage… few applications in telecom”).\n    - Verbal reinforcement learning: The paper articulates a principled agent framework (actor/evaluator/self-reflection/memory), ties it to interpretable, instruction-following behavior, and flags classic RL issues (exploration-exploitation), again grounding analysis in telecom decision-making contexts.\n    - Black-box optimization: It explains the appeal (avoid bespoke modeling) and the key limitation (“performance cannot be guaranteed… relies on quality of examples”), explicitly connecting to telecom’s reliability requirements.\n    - Convex optimization: The survey details an end-to-end LLM workflow (problem modeling, code generation, solver execution, automatic fixes) and recognizes the hard cases (“highly non-convex… coupled variables… require dedicated human effort”), thus acknowledging practical limits and pointing to where LLM support is most feasible.\n  - Prediction (Section “Time Series LLM for Prediction Problems”):\n    - Encoder-decoder vs decoder-only trade-offs are explored with attention mechanisms and expressibility considerations (later noting decoder-only attention matrices being triangular/full-column rank). Tokenization “patching” is justified with compute/memory reduction and applicability to telecom’s scale. The frozen/preprocessing-based approaches and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA/LNT) are explained with clear rationale (efficiency constraints at edge/mobile) and concrete guidance on where each makes sense (short-term predictions, zero-shot vs fine-tuned specialization). Multi-modality is connected to sensing and telecom-specific contexts (CSI, mmWave beamforming, traffic influenced by weather), not just described generically.\n\n- Challenges and Future Directions:\n  - The challenges section gives thoughtful, telecom-grounded commentary: dataset scarcity/coverage across standards/troubleshooting/Q&A; deployment latency and bandwidth constraints; prompt-engineering difficulty balancing specificity/generalization/context; retrieval-augmented efficiency costs; hallucination mitigation; and economic constraints with concrete cost figures and small-model alternatives (GPT-4o mini, Llama3-8b). This section is especially strong in connecting methodological limitations to telecom operational realities.\n\nWhere the analysis is weaker or uneven:\n- In some places, the discussion remains largely descriptive or aspirational, especially around multi-modal prediction and certain application frameworks (e.g., configuration generation) where deeper failure-mode analysis or empirical comparisons are limited. The “Related Surveys” section primarily contrasts topical coverage rather than probing underlying methodological causes in those prior works. Some claims (e.g., decoder-only attention expressibility) are referenced but not explored in detail across diverse telecom tasks.\n- Several sections summarize many techniques rapidly without consistently analyzing assumptions or boundary conditions (e.g., pre-training scalability techniques, 3D parallelism, ZeRO), which are introduced more as an inventory than as a critical analysis of trade-offs for telecom-specific deployments.\n\nOverall, the survey demonstrates strong analytical interpretation and technically grounded commentary in multiple sections, linking mechanisms to telecom constraints, but the depth varies across topics. Hence, a score of 4 is appropriate.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe “Challenges and Future Directions of LLM-empowered telecom” section systematically identifies a broad set of research gaps and future work items across data, methods/algorithms, systems deployment, and practical constraints. It generally explains why these issues matter and hints at their impact on the field, but the depth of analysis is uneven across items, with several gaps discussed at a high level rather than deeply unpacked.\n\nEvidence supporting the score:\n\n1) Data and training gaps (clearly identified, with meaningful impact discussion)\n- In “Telecom-domain LLM training,” the paper explicitly highlights the scarcity and fragmentation of telecom-specific datasets and the difficulty of collecting comprehensive corpora (“Sufficient telecom-related datasets are prerequisites… obtaining a sizable dataset exclusively focused on communication networks can be challenging.”). It ties this to practical impact by noting privacy, diversity of sources, and the need to balance model size and performance for feasibility (“balancing model size and performance is crucial… model compression, knowledge distillation… to reduce the model’s size and enhance its efficiency…”).\n- The inclusion of Table “Summary of Telecom datasets for LLM” shows an awareness of current resources and underscores the gap in breadth, scale, and openness across tasks (summarization, QA, classification), which directly impacts the ability to train robust telecom-domain LLMs.\n\n2) Deployment and systems constraints (well articulated with consequences)\n- “Practical LLM deployment in telecom” discusses stringent latency requirements for real-world applications (autonomous driving, robotic control), explaining why cloud-only solutions are inadequate (“central cloud-based LLM… task uploading and solution downloading may increase the service delay… the LLM inference time will also contribute to system latency… ranging from 0.58 to 90 seconds.”). It further analyzes edge deployment constraints (“edge servers… limited computational or storage capacity”) and proposes hybrid strategies while noting coordination challenges (“coordinating LLMs at different levels… selecting appropriate LLMs for diverse user tasks”).\n- This demonstrates both identification and impact analysis: the latency and capacity constraints directly affect feasibility and service quality for telecom URLLC-type scenarios.\n\n3) Methodological and interaction gaps (identified with rationale but not deeply developed)\n- “Prompt engineering for telecom applications” recognizes the complexity of crafting effective prompts due to the breadth of telecom concepts and the specificity–generality trade-off (“overly specific prompts may limit… general prompts may lead to irrelevant responses”). It notes the impact on accuracy and relevance and suggests standard prompting templates, but does not deeply analyze mechanisms or provide a concrete framework for evaluation or design across task classes. The importance is clear, but the discussion remains relatively high-level.\n- “LLM-enabled planning in telecom” points out that “recent benchmarks have shown that LLMs struggle with tasks requiring complex planning,” and explains why this matters (many telecom tasks need multi-step scheduling). It proposes plausible directions (automated task decomposition, simulation-environment training), which shows awareness of methodological gaps and impact, though the analysis stops short of a detailed plan for how to operationalize these in telecom-specific pipelines.\n\n4) Reliability, efficiency, and cost gaps (well motivated with clear implications)\n- “Overcoming hallucination problems in telecom applications” clearly describes the risk to reliability (“Hallucination… can severely undermine the reliability and credibility…”) and suggests mitigation (post-generation verification, external knowledge bases, real-time fact-checking, adversarial testing). The potential impact on trust and safety in telecom operations is explicit.\n- “Retrieval augmented-LLM for telecom” identifies an important trade-off: improved relevance vs. increased context length and computational cost that harms latency (“slow-response issues… may prevent the application of some scenarios with tight delay budget”). This is a strong articulation of impact and an area where telecom requirements differ from general NLP.\n- “Economic and affordable LLMs” gives concrete training and inference cost examples (“GPT-4 exceeded $100 million… LLaMa2 70B… $1.7 million… using GPT-4 for customer service… more than $21,000 per month”) and argues for small models (GPT-4o mini, Llama3-8b) as pragmatic paths. The financial impact on adoption is clearly presented.\n\n5) Multi-modal and optimization gaps (identified with motivation; mixed depth)\n- “Multi-modal LLMs for telecom” and “Multi-modal LLM for Telecom Prediction” explain why multi-modality is crucial (sensing in 6G, environment-aware CSI and beamforming), and how it could improve prediction and management. The impact is clearly motivational (more accurate CSI, blockage prediction, QoE), though the section is more prospective than deeply analytical about technical barriers (e.g., calibration across modalities, data alignment, real-time fusion constraints).\n- “LLM for resource allocation and network optimization” and “LLM-enhanced machine learning for telecom” recognize integration gaps (e.g., reward design, coupling of control variables) and present advantages (language-guided optimization, interpretability) alongside challenges (complex optimization structure). The analysis is sound but somewhat brief; it lists opportunities and high-level obstacles without detailed methodological pathways or risk models.\n\nWhy not a 5:\n- Although the section covers many major gaps across data, methods, deployment, reliability, and cost, the depth of analysis varies. Several items (prompt engineering standards, multi-step planning integration, multi-modal fusion challenges, telecom-specific benchmarking and evaluation frameworks, privacy and governance beyond brief mentions, robustness to adversarial telecom inputs) are noted but not deeply explored in terms of root causes, technical barriers, and structured impact pathways or prioritization.\n- The discussion often proposes directions (e.g., standard prompt templates, hybrid deployment, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, retrieval optimization) but stops short of a detailed roadmap or taxonomy of gaps with measurable consequences and research milestones.\n\nOverall, the section merits 4 points: it is comprehensive and well-motivated, with clear articulation of why these gaps matter to telecom and their likely impact, but several areas would benefit from deeper technical analysis and more concrete frameworks to reach a “5” level.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe paper proposes several forward-looking research directions that are clearly grounded in identified research gaps and real-world telecom needs, but the analysis of their potential impact and the actionable pathways is somewhat brief in places.\n\nEvidence of strong gap identification tied to future directions:\n- In “Challenges of Applying LLM Techniques to Telecom,” the authors articulate specific gaps:\n  - Telecom-domain LLM training: scarcity and fragmentation of domain datasets, heterogeneity of telecom concepts, and the need to balance model size and performance (“Sufficient telecom-related datasets are prerequisites…”, “telecom networks involve a large number of various concepts…”, and the discussion on model size/performance trade-offs).\n  - Practical LLM deployment in telecom: latency constraints for real-time use cases (autonomous driving, robotics), limited edge resources, and coordination across cloud/edge/device (“stringent requirements for service delay…”, “network edge servers have limited computational or storage capacity…”).\n  - Prompt engineering: difficulty of crafting effective prompts due to domain complexity and the need to balance specificity and generality (“Prompt engineering is a crucial aspect…”, “telecom networks encompass a wide range of concepts…”, and the suggestion to publicize standard prompting templates).\n\nThese challenges are then directly addressed in “Future Directions” with coherent and relevant topics:\n- Multi-modal LLMs for telecom: targets 6G sensing and real-world network dynamics by proposing multi-modal inputs (text, images, LiDAR, video) for CSI prediction and mmWave/THz beamforming with explicit telecom examples (“predict signal transmission blockage…”, “better CSI estimation results…”). This aligns well with the sensing gap and offers a concrete application track.\n- LLM-enabled planning in telecom: responds to the multi-step complexity gap with suggestions like automated task decomposition and integrating simulation environments (“developing better algorithms for planning…”, “integrating simulation environments directly within the training process…”).\n- Model compression and fast inference: addresses edge deployment constraints, proposing compression, pruning, and defining standard telecom evaluation metrics (“compressing the model size…”, “calls for novel model compression and pruning techniques…”, “standard metrics must be defined…”).\n- Overcoming hallucination problems: maps to reliability gaps in telecom by recommending post-generation verification, external knowledge bases, real-time fact-checking, and adversarial testing (“developing methods to reduce hallucination…”, “incorporating cross-referencing mechanisms…”, “adversarial testing…”).\n- Retrieval augmented-LLM for telecom: explicitly couples RAG with latency and efficiency constraints, suggesting optimized indexing and dynamic retrieval volume (“optimizing retrieval mechanisms…”, “dynamically adjusting the amount of retrieved information…”).\n- Economic and affordable LLMs: confronts cost barriers with concrete recommendations and pricing details (e.g., GPT-4o mini token costs), linking directly to practical viability (“Priced at just $0.15 per million input tokens…”, “telecom companies can use GPT-4o mini for customer support chatbots…”).\n- Real-world implementations: shows practical pathways through on-device LLM advances (Apple’s flash-based inference, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon platform) and natural language data access (SQL-GPT), clearly tying to real deployment scenarios (“efficiently running LLMs on devices with limited DRAM…”, “on-device AI into smartphones…”).\n\nInnovative topics and telecom specificity:\n- The multi-modal LLM direction is notably innovative in the telecom context, with detailed scenarios (CSI, beamforming, QoE) and explicit modality combinations that go beyond generic LLM discussions.\n- The planning direction acknowledges current LLM limitations and suggests concrete mechanisms (structured reasoning frameworks, simulation-based training) relevant to telecom’s multi-layer control and optimization tasks.\n- The retrieval augmentation efficiency angle is tailored to telecom’s latency constraints, which reflects real-world operational needs.\n- The cost-focused direction is pragmatic and actionable, offering specific model choices and use cases tied to telecom operations.\n\nWhere the paper falls short of a perfect score:\n- While future directions are well-chosen and clearly linked to gaps, many sections stop at high-level recommendations without laying out detailed, actionable research roadmaps (e.g., specific benchmarks, datasets, evaluation protocols, or step-by-step methodologies to operationalize proposals). For instance:\n  - “LLM-enabled planning in telecom” proposes automated task decomposition and simulation integration but does not outline concrete frameworks or metrics to evaluate planning quality in telecom settings.\n  - “Model compression and fast inference” and “Retrieval augmented-LLM” identify the right levers but remain general about algorithmic choices and performance trade-off quantification for telecom-grade latency and reliability.\n  - “LLM for resource allocation and network optimization” recognizes the promise and challenges but offers limited specificity on how to systematically integrate LLMs into complex coupled optimization tasks beyond acknowledging their interpretability and instruction-following strengths.\n\nOverall, the Future Directions section is comprehensive, addresses real-world telecom constraints, and proposes multiple innovative themes with clear relevance. The analysis is solid but could benefit from deeper elaboration on academic and practical impact with more concrete, actionable paths. Hence, a score of 4 is appropriate."]}

For example, while the transition from foundational models to more advanced AI-driven techniques is mentioned, the survey could benefit from a more systematic presentation of how these methods build on one another over time.\n\nOverall, the survey is well-organized and covers the major advancements and trends in the field of LLM integration into telecommunications. However, it would have benefited from a more explicit discussion of the inherent connections between methods and a clearer explanation of the evolutionary stages, which is why it scores a 4 rather than a full 5 points.", "**Score: 3 points**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe review in question provides some information on datasets and evaluation metrics, but it lacks comprehensive coverage and detailed descriptions, which led to the assignment of a 3-point score. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Diversity of Datasets and Metrics**:\n   - The text mentions various domains and applications where LLMs are utilized, such as time series forecasting, resource management in AI-enabled wireless networks, and predictive maintenance. However, it does not provide explicit examples or names of specific datasets used in these applications. \n   - Evaluation metrics are mentioned in a broad sense, such as those used in assessing NLP tasks, network optimization, and predictive maintenance. Specific metrics like Energy Cost and Inference Time are mentioned (e.g., \"Metrics like Energy Cost and Inference Time clarify resource utilization during model inference\"), but again, without detailed descriptions or a comprehensive list of metrics used across different studies referenced.\n\n2. **Rationality of Datasets and Metrics**:\n   - The choice of datasets seems implicit rather than explicit, as the discussion refers to applications and challenges but does not describe particular datasets that directly support the research objectives.\n   - The evaluation metrics are academically sound and relevant to the field, as indicated by references to known concepts like zero-shot learning, few-shot learning, and reinforcement learning metrics. However, the text lacks a detailed explanation of how these metrics were chosen or how they align with the research objectives.\n\n3. **Detail and Explanation**:\n   - There is a lack of detailed description regarding the scale, application scenario, and labeling method of datasets.
