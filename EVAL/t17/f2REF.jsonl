However, recent efforts on LLMs for wireless networks are limited to a direct application of existing language models that were designed for natural language processing (NLP) applications. To address this challenge and create wireless-centric foundation models, this paper presents a comprehensive vision on how to design universal foundation models that are tailored towards the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI)-native networks. Diverging from NLP-based foundation models, the proposed framework promotes the design of large multi-modal models (LMMs) fostered by three key capabilities: 1) processing of multi-modal sensing data, 2) grounding of physical symbol representations in real-world wireless systems using causal reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and 3) enabling instructibility from the wireless environment feedback to facilitate dynamic network adaptation thanks to logical and mathematical reasoning facilitated by neuro-symbolic AI. In essence, these properties enable the proposed LMM framework to build universal capabilities that cater to various cross-layer networking tasks and alignment of intents across different domains. Preliminary results from experimental evaluation demonstrate the efficacy of grounding using RAG in LMMs, and showcase the alignment of LMMs with wireless system designs. Furthermore, the enhanced rationale exhibited in the responses to mathematical questions by LMMs, compared to vanilla LLMs, demonstrates the logical and mathematical reasoning capabilities inherent in LMMs. Building on those results, we present a sequel of open questions and challenges for LMMs. We then conclude with a set of recommendations that ignite the path towards LMM-empowered AI-native systems."}

While the principles of federated learning are fairly generic, its methodology assumes that the underlying models are neural networks. However, virtual keyboards are typically powered by n-gram language models for latency reasons. We propose to train a recurrent neural network language model using the decentralized FederatedAveraging algorithm and to approximate this federated model server-side with an n-gram model that can be deployed to devices for fast inference. Our technical contributions include ways of handling large vocabularies, algorithms to correct capitalization errors in user data, and efficient finite state transducer algorithms to convert word language models to word-piece language models and vice versa. The n-gram language models trained with federated learning are compared to n-grams trained with traditional server-based algorithms using A/B tests on tens of millions of users of virtual keyboard.

Due to previous binarization methods collapsing LLMs, we propose a novel approach, Partially-Binarized LLM (PB-LLM), which can achieve extreme low-bit quantization while maintaining the linguistic reasoning capacity of quantized LLMs. Specifically, our exploration first uncovers the ineffectiveness of naive applications of existing binarization algorithms and highlights the imperative role of salient weights in achieving low-bit quantization. Thus, PB-LLM filters a small ratio of salient weights during binarization, allocating them to higher-bit storage, i.e., partially-binarization. PB-LLM is extended to recover the capacities of quantized LMMs, by analyzing from the perspective of post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT). Under PTQ, combining the concepts from GPTQ, we reconstruct the binarized weight matrix guided by the Hessian matrix and successfully recover the reasoning capacity of PB-LLM in low-bit. Under QAT, we freeze the salient weights during training, explore the derivation of optimal scaling factors crucial for minimizing the quantization error, and propose a scaling mechanism based on this derived scaling strategy for residual binarized weights. Those explorations and the developed methodologies significantly contribute to rejuvenating the performance of low-bit quantized LLMs and present substantial advancements in the field of network binarization for LLMs.The code is available at https://github.com/hahnyuan/BinaryLLM."}

Transiting LLMs from datacenters to edge devices brings benefits like better privacy and availability, but is challenged by their massive parameter size and thus unbearable runtime costs. To this end, we present EdgeMoE, an on-device inference engine for mixture-of-expert (MoE) LLMs -- a popular form of sparse LLM that scales its parameter size with almost constant computing complexity. EdgeMoE achieves both memory- and compute-efficiency by partitioning the model into the storage hierarchy: non-expert weights are held in device memory; while expert weights are held on external storage and fetched to memory only when activated. This design is motivated by a key observation that expert weights are bulky but infrequently used due to sparse activation. To further reduce the expert I/O swapping overhead, EdgeMoE incorporates two novel techniques: (1) expert-wise bitwidth adaptation that reduces the expert sizes with tolerable accuracy loss; (2) expert preloading that predicts the activated experts ahead of time and preloads it with the compute-I/O pipeline. On popular MoE LLMs and edge devices, EdgeMoE showcase significant memory savings and speedup over competitive baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/UbiquitousLearning/mllm."}

The precision of prevailing deep learning-driven traffic prediction models typically sees an upward trend with a rise in the volume of training data. However, the procurement of comprehensive spatiotemporal datasets for traffic is often fraught with challenges, primarily stemming from the substantial costs associated with data collection and retention. Consequently, developing a model that can achieve accurate predictions and good generalization ability in areas with limited historical traffic data is a challenging problem. It is noteworthy that the rapidly advancing pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) of recent years have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in cross-modality knowledge transfer and few-shot learning. Recognizing the sequential nature of traffic data, similar to language, we introduce TPLLM, a novel traffic prediction framework leveraging LLMs. In this framework, we construct a sequence embedding layer based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and a graph embedding layer based on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to extract sequence features and spatial features, respectively. These are subsequently integrated to form inputs that are suitable for LLMs. A Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning approach is applied to TPLLM, thereby facilitating efficient learning and minimizing computational demands.

Given the lack of data, limited resources, semantic context requirements, and so on, this work focuses on TS-for-LLM, where we aim to activate LLM's ability for TS data by designing a TS embedding method suitable for LLM. The proposed method is named TEST. It first tokenizes TS, builds an encoder to embed TS via instance-wise, feature-wise, and text-prototype-aligned contrast, where the TS embedding space is aligned to LLM embedding layer space, then creates soft prompts to make LLM more open to that embeddings, and finally implements TS tasks using the frozen LLM. We also demonstrate the feasibility of TS-for-LLM through theory and experiments. Experiments are carried out on TS classification, forecasting, and representation tasks using eight frozen LLMs with various structures and sizes. The results show that the pre-trained LLM with TEST strategy can achieve better or comparable performance than today's SOTA TS models and offer benefits for few-shot and generalization.

Our method involves constructing an inference cost model that takes into account the characteristics of flash memory, guiding us to optimize in two critical areas: reducing the volume of data transferred from flash and reading data in larger, more contiguous chunks. Within this hardware-informed framework, we introduce two principal techniques. First, \"windowing\" strategically reduces data transfer by reusing previously activated neurons, and second, \"row-column bundling\", tailored to the sequential data access strengths of flash memory, increases the size of data chunks read from flash memory.

In this paper, we systematically review the recently emerging methods of automated alignment, attempting to explore how to achieve effective, scalable, automated alignment once the capabilities of LLMs exceed those of humans. Specifically, we categorize existing automated alignment methods into 4 major categories based on the sources of alignment signals and discuss the current status and potential development of each category. Additionally, we explore the underlying mechanisms that enable automated alignment and discuss the essential factors that make automated alignment technologies feasible and effective from the fundamental role of alignment."}

However, the performance of MoE is limited by load imbalance and high latency of All-to-All communication, along with relatively redundant computation owing to large expert capacity. Load imbalance may result from existing routing policies that consistently tend to select certain experts. The frequent inter-node communication in the All-to-All procedure also significantly prolongs the training time. To alleviate the above performance problems, we propose a novel routing strategy that combines load balance and locality by converting partial inter-node communication to that of intra-node. Notably, we elucidate that there is a minimum threshold for expert capacity, calculated through the maximal angular deviation between the gating weights of the experts and the assigned tokens. We port these modifications on the PanGu-Sigma model based on the MindSpore framework with multi-level routing and conduct experiments on Ascend clusters. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed LocMoE reduces training time per epoch by 12.68% to 22.24% compared to classical routers, such as hash router and switch router, without impacting the model accuracy."}

However, current LLMs heavily rely on cloud computing, leading to prolonged latency, high bandwidth cost, and privacy concerns. Edge computing is promising to address such concerns by deploying LLMs on edge devices, closer to data sources. Some works try to leverage model quantization to reduce the model size to fit the resource-constraint edge devices, but they lead to accuracy loss. Other works use cloud-edge collaboration, suffering from unstable network connections. In this work, we leverage collaborative edge computing to facilitate the collaboration among edge devices and cloud servers for jointly performing efficient LLM inference. We propose a general framework to partition the LLM model into shards and deploy on distributed devices. To achieve efficient LLM inference, we formulate an adaptive joint device selection and model partition problem and design an efficient dynamic programming algorithm to optimize the inference latency and throughput, respectively. Experiments of Llama2 serial models on a heterogeneous physical prototype demonstrate that EdgeShard achieves up to 50% latency reduction and 2x throughput improvement over baseline methods."}

However, activation sparsity is determined by activation functions, and commonly used ones like SwiGLU and GeGLU exhibit limited sparsity. Simply replacing these functions with ReLU fails to achieve sufficient sparsity. Moreover, inadequate training data can further increase the risk of performance degradation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel dReLU function, which is designed to improve LLM activation sparsity, along with a high-quality training data mixture ratio to facilitate effective sparsification. Additionally, we leverage sparse activation patterns within the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) experts of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models to further boost efficiency. By applying our neuron sparsification method to the Mistral and Mixtral models, only 2.5 billion and 4.3 billion parameters are activated per inference iteration, respectively, while achieving even more powerful model performance. Evaluation results demonstrate that this sparsity achieves a 2-5x decoding speedup. Remarkably, on mobile phones, our TurboSparse-Mixtral-47B achieves an inference speed of 11 tokens per second.

Over the last few decades, supply chains greatly benefited from advances in computation, which allowed the transition from manual processing to automation and cost-effective optimization. Nonetheless, business operators still need to spend substantial efforts in explaining and interpreting the optimization outcomes to stakeholders. Motivated by the recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), we study how this disruptive technology can help bridge the gap between supply chain automation and human comprehension and trust thereof. We design OptiGuide -- a framework that accepts as input queries in plain text, and outputs insights about the underlying optimization outcomes. Our framework does not forgo the state-of-the-art combinatorial optimization technology, but rather leverages it to quantitatively answer what-if scenarios (e.g., how would the cost change if we used supplier B instead of supplier A for a given demand?). Importantly, our design does not require sending proprietary data over to LLMs, which can be a privacy concern in some circumstances. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on a real server placement scenario within Microsoft's cloud supply chain. Along the way, we develop a general evaluation benchmark, which can be used to evaluate the accuracy of the LLM output in other scenarios."}

As a result, our solution significantly reduces the high costs of deploying multiple, different-sized LLMs by overlaying LLMs quantized to varying bit-widths, such as 3, 4, ..., $n$ bits, into a memory footprint comparable to a single $n$-bit LLM. All the supported LLMs with varying bit-widths demonstrate state-of-the-art model quality and inference throughput, proving itself to be a compelling option for deployment of multiple, different-sized LLMs. Our code is open-sourced and available online."}

However, in this study, we discovered that many layers of LLMs exhibit high similarity, and some layers play a negligible role in network functionality. Based on this observation, we define a metric called Block Influence (BI) to gauge the significance of each layer in LLMs. We then propose a straightforward pruning approach: layer removal, in which we directly delete the redundant layers in LLMs based on their BI scores. Experiments demonstrate that our method, which we call ShortGPT, significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in model pruning. Moreover, ShortGPT is orthogonal to quantization-like methods, enabling further reduction in parameters and computation. The ability to achieve better results through simple layer removal, as opposed to more complex pruning techniques, suggests a high degree of redundancy in the model architecture."}

Firstly, during the decoding stage, caching previous tokens' Key and Value states (KV) consumes extensive memory. Secondly, popular LLMs cannot generalize to longer texts than the training sequence length. Window attention, where only the most recent KVs are cached, is a natural approach -- but we show that it fails when the text length surpasses the cache size. We observe an interesting phenomenon, namely attention sink, that keeping the KV of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of window attention. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the emergence of attention sink is due to the strong attention scores towards initial tokens as a \"sink\" even if they are not semantically important. Based on the above analysis, we introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more. In addition, we discover that adding a placeholder token as a dedicated attention sink during pre-training can further improve streaming deployment. In streaming settings, StreamingLLM outperforms the sliding window recomputation baseline by up to 22.2x speedup. Code and datasets are provided at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/streaming-llm."}

However, the extremely high data and computational resource requirements for the performance of LLMs compel developers to resort to outsourcing training or utilizing third-party data and computing resources. These strategies may expose the model within the network to maliciously manipulated training data and processing, providing an opportunity for attackers to embed a hidden backdoor into the model, termed a backdoor attack. Backdoor attack in LLMs refers to embedding a hidden backdoor in LLMs that causes the model to perform normally on benign samples but exhibit degraded performance on poisoned ones. This issue is particularly concerning within communication networks where reliability and security are paramount. Despite the extensive research on backdoor attacks, there remains a lack of in-depth exploration specifically within the context of LLMs employed in communication networks, and a systematic review of such attacks is currently absent. In this survey, we systematically propose a taxonomy of backdoor attacks in LLMs as used in communication networks, dividing them into four major categories: input-triggered, prompt-triggered, instruction-triggered, and demonstration-triggered attacks.

On-device LLM is becoming increasingly important: running LLMs locally on edge devices can reduce the cloud computing cost and protect users' privacy. However, the astronomical model size and the limited hardware resource pose significant deployment challenges. We propose Activation-aware Weight Quantization (AWQ), a hardware-friendly approach for LLM low-bit weight-only quantization. AWQ finds that not all weights in an LLM are equally important. Protecting only 1% salient weights can greatly reduce quantization error. To identify salient weight channels, we should refer to the activation distribution, not weights. To avoid the hardware-inefficient mix-precision quantization, we mathematically derive that scaling up the salient channels can reduce the quantization error. AWQ employs an equivalent transformation to scale the salient weight channels to protect them. The scale is determined by collecting the activation statistics offline. AWQ does not rely on any backpropagation or reconstruction, so it generalizes to different domains and modalities without overfitting the calibration set. AWQ outperforms existing work on various language modeling and domain-specific benchmarks (coding and math). Thanks to better generalization, it achieves excellent quantization performance for instruction-tuned LMs and, for the first time, multi-modal LMs. Alongside AWQ, we implement TinyChat, an efficient and flexible inference framework tailored for 4-bit on-device LLM/VLMs. With kernel fusion and platform-aware weight packing, TinyChat offers more than 3x speedup over the Huggingface FP16 implementation on both desktop and mobile GPUs.

LLMCad incorporates three novel techniques: (1) Instead of generating candidate tokens in a sequential manner, LLMCad employs the smaller LLM to construct a token tree, encompassing a wider range of plausible token pathways. Subsequently, the larger LLM can efficiently validate all of these pathways simultaneously. (2) It employs a self-adjusting fallback strategy, swiftly initiating the verification process whenever the smaller LLM generates an erroneous token.

We show that depending on the inputs, the model, and the service-level agreements, there are several knobs available to the LLM inference provider to use for being energy efficient. We characterize the impact of these knobs on the latency, throughput, as well as the energy. By exploring these trade-offs, we offer valuable insights into optimizing energy usage without compromising on performance, thereby paving the way for sustainable and cost-effective LLM deployment in data center environments."}

Nonetheless, the performance of on-device LLMs is intrinsically constrained by resource limitations on edge devices. Sitting between cloud and on-device AI, mobile edge intelligence (MEI) presents a viable solution by provisioning AI capabilities at the edge of mobile networks, enabling end users to offload heavy AI computation to capable edge servers nearby. This article provides a contemporary survey on harnessing MEI for LLMs. We begin by illustrating several killer applications to demonstrate the urgent need for deploying LLMs at the network edge. Next, we present the preliminaries of LLMs and MEI, followed by resource-efficient LLM techniques. We then present an architectural overview of MEI for LLMs (MEI4LLM), outlining its core components and how it supports the deployment of LLMs. Subsequently, we delve into various aspects of MEI4LLM, extensively covering edge LLM caching and delivery, edge LLM training, and edge LLM inference. Finally, we identify future research opportunities.

We investigate how vocabulary size impacts LLM scaling laws by training models ranging from 33M to 3B parameters on up to 500B characters with various vocabulary configurations. We propose three complementary approaches for predicting the compute-optimal vocabulary size: IsoFLOPs analysis, derivative estimation, and parametric fit of the loss function. Our approaches converge on the conclusion that the optimal vocabulary size depends on the compute budget, with larger models requiring larger vocabularies. Most LLMs, however, use insufficient vocabulary sizes. For example, we predict that the optimal vocabulary size of Llama2-70B should have been at least 216K, 7 times larger than its vocabulary of 32K. We validate our predictions empirically by training models with 3B parameters across different FLOPs budgets. Adopting our predicted optimal vocabulary size consistently improves downstream performance over commonly used vocabulary sizes. By increasing the vocabulary size from the conventional 32K to 43K, we improve performance on ARC-Challenge from 29.1 to 32.0 with the same 2.3e21 FLOPs. Our work highlights the importance of jointly considering tokenization and model scaling for efficient pre-training.

While effective, a major bottleneck of using these models in practice is the computationally costly datastore search, which can be performed as frequently as every time step. In this paper, we present RetoMaton - retrieval automaton - which approximates the datastore search, based on (1) saving pointers between consecutive datastore entries, and (2) clustering of entries into \"states\". This effectively results in a weighted finite automaton built on top of the datastore, instead of representing the datastore as a flat list. The creation of the automaton is unsupervised, and a RetoMaton can be constructed from any text collection: either the original training corpus or from another domain. Traversing this automaton at inference time, in parallel to the LM inference, reduces its perplexity by up to 1.85, or alternatively saves up to 83% of the nearest neighbor searches over $k$NN-LM (Khandelwal et al., 2020) without hurting perplexity.

Multiple studies focus on bridging the LLMs to external tools to extend the application scenarios. However, the current LLMs' ability to perceive tool use is limited to a single text query, which may result in ambiguity in understanding the users' real intentions. LLMs are expected to eliminate that by perceiving the information in the visual- or auditory-grounded instructions. Therefore, in this paper, we propose MLLM-Tool, a system incorporating open-source LLMs and multi-modal encoders so that the learned LLMs can be conscious of multi-modal input instruction and then select the function-matched tool correctly. To facilitate the evaluation of the model's capability, we collect a dataset featuring multi-modal input tools from HuggingFace. Another essential feature of our dataset is that it also contains multiple potential choices for the same instruction due to the existence of identical functions and synonymous functions, which provides more potential solutions for the same query. The experiments reveal that our MLLM-Tool is capable of recommending appropriate tools for multi-modal instructions. Codes and data are available at https://github.com/MLLM-Tool/MLLM-Tool."}

In this paper, we introduce PipeRAG, a novel algorithm-system co-design approach to reduce generation latency and enhance generation quality. PipeRAG integrates (1) pipeline parallelism to enable concurrent retrieval and generation processes, (2) flexible retrieval intervals to maximize the efficiency of pipeline parallelism, and (3) a performance model to automatically balance retrieval quality and latency based on the generation states and underlying hardware.

This alignment process, which synchronizes a language model trained on textual data with encoders and decoders trained on multi-modal data, often necessitates extensive training of several projection layers in multiple stages. Inspired by LLM-as-agent methodologies, we propose a novel Input/Output (I/O) alignment mechanism that operates directly at the level of natural language. It aligns the LLM's output with the input of generative models, avoiding the complexities associated with latent feature alignments, and simplifying the multiple training stages of existing MLLMs into a single, efficient process. This conceptual advancement leads to significant reductions in both data and computational costs.

Unlike natural language process (NLP) and computer vision (CV), where a single large model can tackle multiple tasks, models for time series forecasting are often specialized, necessitating distinct designs for different tasks and applications. While pre-trained foundation models have made impressive strides in NLP and CV, their development in time series domains has been constrained by data sparsity. Recent studies have revealed that large language models (LLMs) possess robust pattern recognition and reasoning abilities over complex sequences of tokens. However, the challenge remains in effectively aligning the modalities of time series data and natural language to leverage these capabilities. In this work, we present Time-LLM, a reprogramming framework to repurpose LLMs for general time series forecasting with the backbone language models kept intact. We begin by reprogramming the input time series with text prototypes before feeding it into the frozen LLM to align the two modalities. To augment the LLM's ability to reason with time series data, we propose Prompt-as-Prefix (PaP), which enriches the input context and directs the transformation of reprogrammed input patches. The transformed time series patches from the LLM are finally projected to obtain the forecasts.

PowerInfer-2 achieves up to a 27.8x speed increase compared to state-of-the-art frameworks. PowerInfer-2 is the first system to serve a 47B LLM on a smartphone, achieving 11.68 tokens/s. Notably, these performance improvements preserve model quality with negligible accuracy degradation."}
{"id": "107", "arxiv": "2312.11462v4", "title": "Cascade Speculative Drafting for Even Faster LLM Inference", "abstract": "Introduced to enhance the efficiency of large language model (LLM) inference, speculative decoding operates by having a smaller model generate a draft. A larger target model then reviews this draft to align with its output, and any acceptance by the target model results in a reduction of the number of the target model runs, ultimately improving efficiency. However, the drafting process in speculative decoding includes slow autoregressive generation and allocates equal time to generating tokens, irrespective of their importance. These inefficiencies collectively contribute to the suboptimal performance of speculative decoding. To further improve LLM inference, we introduce Cascade Speculative Drafting (CS Drafting), a speculative execution algorithm that incorporates two types of cascades. The Vertical Cascade eliminates autoregressive generation from neural models, while the Horizontal Cascade optimizes time allocation in drafting for improved efficiency. Combining both cascades, CS Drafting achieves greater speedup compared to the baselines in our experiments, while preserving the same output distribution as the target model."}

Particularly in the era of AI-Generated Content (AIGC), the powerful capacity of retrieval in providing additional knowledge enables RAG to assist existing generative AI in producing high-quality outputs. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated revolutionary abilities in language understanding and generation, while still facing inherent limitations, such as hallucinations and out-of-date internal knowledge. Given the powerful abilities of RAG in providing the latest and helpful auxiliary information, Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models (RA-LLMs) have emerged to harness external and authoritative knowledge bases, rather than solely relying on the model's internal knowledge, to augment the generation quality of LLMs. In this survey, we comprehensively review existing research studies in RA-LLMs, covering three primary technical perspectives: architectures, training strategies, and applications. As the preliminary knowledge, we briefly introduce the foundations and recent advances of LLMs. Then, to illustrate the practical significance of RAG for LLMs, we systematically review mainstream relevant work by their architectures, training strategies, and application areas, detailing specifically the challenges of each and the corresponding capabilities of RA-LLMs. Finally, to deliver deeper insights, we discuss current limitations and several promising directions for future research.

They have attracted significant attention and been deployed in numerous downstream applications. Nevertheless, akin to a double-edged sword, LLMs also present potential risks. They could suffer from private data leaks or yield inappropriate, harmful, or misleading content. Additionally, the rapid progress of LLMs raises concerns about the potential emergence of superintelligent systems without adequate safeguards. To effectively capitalize on LLM capacities as well as ensure their safe and beneficial development, it is critical to conduct a rigorous and comprehensive evaluation of LLMs. This survey endeavors to offer a panoramic perspective on the evaluation of LLMs. We categorize the evaluation of LLMs into three major groups: knowledge and capability evaluation, alignment evaluation and safety evaluation. In addition to the comprehensive review on the evaluation methodologies and benchmarks on these three aspects, we collate a compendium of evaluations pertaining to LLMs' performance in specialized domains, and discuss the construction of comprehensive evaluation platforms that cover LLM evaluations on capabilities, alignment, safety, and applicability. We hope that this comprehensive overview will stimulate further research interests in the evaluation of LLMs, with the ultimate goal of making evaluation serve as a cornerstone in guiding the responsible development of LLMs. We envision that this will channel their evolution into a direction that maximizes societal benefit while minimizing potential risks.

In this work, we introduce a 1-bit LLM variant, namely BitNet b1.58, in which every single parameter (or weight) of the LLM is ternary {-1, 0, 1}. It matches the full-precision (i.e., FP16 or BF16) Transformer LLM with the same model size and training tokens in terms of both perplexity and end-task performance, while being significantly more cost-effective in terms of latency, memory, throughput, and energy consumption. More profoundly, the 1.58-bit LLM defines a new scaling law and recipe for training new generations of LLMs that are both high-performance and cost-effective. Furthermore, it enables a new computation paradigm and opens the door for designing specific hardware optimized for 1-bit LLMs."}

However, LLMs' efficiency suffers from both heavy computation and memory overheads. Compression techniques like sparsification and quantization are commonly used to mitigate the gap between LLM's computation/memory overheads and hardware capacity. However, existing GPU and transformer-based accelerators cannot efficiently process compressed LLMs, due to the following unresolved challenges: low computational efficiency, underutilized memory bandwidth, and large compilation overheads. This paper proposes FlightLLM, enabling efficient LLMs inference with a complete mapping flow on FPGAs. In FlightLLM, we highlight an innovative solution that the computation and memory overhead of LLMs can be solved by utilizing FPGA-specific resources (e.g., DSP48 and heterogeneous memory hierarchy). We propose a configurable sparse DSP chain to support different sparsity patterns with high computation efficiency. Second, we propose an always-on-chip decode scheme to boost memory bandwidth with mixed-precision support. Finally, to make FlightLLM available for real-world LLMs, we propose a length adaptive compilation method to reduce the compilation overhead. Implemented on the Xilinx Alveo U280 FPGA, FlightLLM achieves 6.0$\\times$ higher energy efficiency and 1.8$\\times$ better cost efficiency against commercial GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA V100S) on modern LLMs (e.g., LLaMA2-7B) using vLLM and SmoothQuant under the batch size of one.

{"id": "115", "arxiv": "2208.03306v1", "title": "Branch-Train-Merge: Embarrassingly Parallel Training of Expert Language Models", "abstract": "We present Branch-Train-Merge (BTM), a communication-efficient algorithm for embarrassingly parallel training of large language models (LLMs). We show it is possible to independently train subparts of a new class of LLMs on different subsets of the data, eliminating the massive multi-node synchronization currently required to train LLMs. BTM learns a set of independent expert LMs (ELMs), each specialized to a different textual domain, such as scientific or legal text. These ELMs can be added and removed to update data coverage, ensembled to generalize to new domains, or averaged to collapse back to a single LM for efficient inference. New ELMs are learned by branching from (mixtures of) ELMs in the current set, further training the parameters on data for the new domain, and then merging the resulting model back into the set for future use. Experiments show that BTM improves in- and out-of-domain perplexities as compared to GPT-style Transformer LMs, when controlling for training cost. Through extensive analysis, we show that these results are robust to different ELM initialization schemes, but require expert domain specialization; LM ensembles with random data splits do not perform well. We also present a study of scaling BTM into a new corpus of 64 domains (192B whitespace-separated tokens in total); the resulting LM (22.4B total parameters) performs as well as a Transformer LM trained with 2.5 times more compute. These gains grow with the number of domains, suggesting more aggressive parallelism could be used to efficiently train larger models in future work."}

Different from previous weight pruning methods that rely on specifically designed hardware, this paper mainly aims to enhance the deployment efficiency of MoE LLMs by introducing plug-and-play expert-level sparsification techniques. Specifically, we propose, for the first time to our best knowledge, post-training approaches for task-agnostic and task-specific expert pruning and skipping of MoE LLMs, tailored to improve deployment efficiency while maintaining model performance across a wide range of tasks. Extensive experiments show that our proposed methods can simultaneously reduce model sizes and increase the inference speed, while maintaining satisfactory performance.

{"id": "117", "arxiv": "2310.15556v2", "title": "TCRA-LLM: Token Compression Retrieval Augmented Large Language Model for Inference Cost Reduction", "abstract": "Since ChatGPT released its API for public use, the number of applications built on top of commercial large language models (LLMs) increase exponentially. One popular usage of such models is leveraging its in-context learning ability and generating responses given user queries leveraging knowledge obtained by retrieval augmentation. One problem of deploying commercial retrieval-augmented LLMs is the cost due to the additionally retrieved context that largely increases the input token size of the LLMs. To mitigate this, we propose a token compression scheme that includes two methods: summarization compression and semantic compression. The first method applies a T5-based model that is fine-tuned by datasets generated using self-instruct containing samples with varying lengths and reduce token size by doing summarization. The second method further compresses the token size by removing words with lower impact on the semantic. In order to adequately evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, we propose and utilize a dataset called Food-Recommendation DB (FRDB) focusing on food recommendation for women around pregnancy period or infants. Our summarization compression can reduce 65% of the retrieval token size with further 0.3% improvement on the accuracy; semantic compression provides a more flexible way to trade-off the token size with performance, for which we can reduce the token size by 20% with only 1.6% of accuracy drop."}
{"id": "118", "arxiv": "2305.13230v2", "title": "To Repeat or Not To Repeat: Insights from Scaling LLM under Token-Crisis", "abstract": "Recent research has highlighted the importance of dataset size in scaling language models. However, large language models (LLMs) are notoriously token-hungry during pre-training, and high-quality text data on the web is approaching its scaling limit for LLMs. To further enhance LLMs, a straightforward approach is to repeat the pre-training data for additional epochs. In this study, we empirically investigate three key aspects under this approach. First, we explore the consequences of repeating pre-training data, revealing that the model is susceptible to overfitting, leading to multi-epoch degradation. Second, we examine the key factors contributing to multi-epoch degradation, finding that significant factors include dataset size, model parameters, and training objectives, while less influential factors consist of dataset quality and model FLOPs. Finally, we explore whether widely used regularization can alleviate multi-epoch degradation. Most regularization techniques do not yield significant improvements, except for dropout, which demonstrates remarkable effectiveness but requires careful tuning when scaling up the model size. Additionally, we discover that leveraging mixture-of-experts (MoE) enables cost-effective and efficient hyper-parameter tuning for computationally intensive dense LLMs with comparable trainable parameters, potentially impacting efficient LLM development on a broader scale."}

Although existing traffic prediction models often emphasize developing complex neural network structures, their accuracy has not improved. Recently, large language models have shown outstanding capabilities in time series analysis. Differing from existing models, LLMs progress mainly through parameter expansion and extensive pretraining while maintaining their fundamental structures. Motivated by these developments, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Large Language Model (ST-LLM) for traffic prediction. In the ST-LLM, we define timesteps at each location as tokens and design a spatial-temporal embedding to learn the spatial location and global temporal patterns of these tokens. Additionally, we integrate these embeddings by a fusion convolution to each token for a unified spatial-temporal representation. Furthermore, we innovate a partially frozen attention strategy to adapt the LLM to capture global spatial-temporal dependencies for traffic prediction. Comprehensive experiments on real traffic datasets offer evidence that ST-LLM is a powerful spatial-temporal learner that outperforms state-of-the-art models. Notably, the ST-LLM also exhibits robust performance in both few-shot and zero-shot prediction scenarios. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/ChenxiLiu-HNU/ST-LLM."}
