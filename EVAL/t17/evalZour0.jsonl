However, there is no description of its scale, labeling, scenarios, or splits in the main text.\n\nRationale for score:\n- The survey provides a solid and domain-aware set of evaluation metrics and criteria, including latency, throughput, energy, robustness, fairness, and privacy, with clear applicability to telecom workflows.\n- However, dataset coverage is limited. Apart from mentioning TeleQnA and generic “synthetic datasets” and “real-world operational data,” there are no detailed descriptions of dataset scale, scenarios, labeling strategies, or explicit justification of dataset choices. Reported performance figures (e.g., F1, AUC-ROC) are presented without naming datasets, sizes, or experimental setups, making applicability and reproducibility unclear.\n- Due to the shallow dataset descriptions and missing experimental specifics, the score is downgraded to 3/5 despite strong metric coverage.", "Score: 3/5\n\nJustification:\n- The paper includes some explicit, contrastive comparisons (e.g., Transformer vs. RNN/CNN; encoder-only vs. decoder-only vs. encoder-decoder; sparse attention vs. full attention; MoE vs. dense models). These show awareness of differences and, to a limited extent, task suitability in telecom (e.g., log analysis vs. chatbots vs. translation-like tasks).\n- However, the comparisons are mostly high-level and not systematically structured across multiple dimensions (e.g., accuracy, latency, memory, robustness, data requirements, deployment cost). Advantages/disadvantages are implied rather than explicitly enumerated, and similarities are rarely discussed.\n- Trade-offs are not deeply analyzed (e.g., how bidirectionality vs. autoregression concretely impacts specific telecom KPIs; quantitative impacts of sparse attention/MoE; interpretability and reliability under telecom constraints). The section lacks tables or clear multi-axis criteria to anchor a comprehensive comparison.\n- Given the largely generic phrasing and limited depth on pros/cons within telecom contexts, the comparison quality is above superficial listing but below a structured, multi-dimensional analysis.\n\nQuoted contrastive sentences (from Section 2.1):\n- “Introduced by Vaswani et al. in 2017, the Transformer architecture replaced traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a purely attention-based mechanism, enabling parallel processing and superior performance on sequence modeling tasks.”\n- “While encoder-only models like BERT excel at bidirectional context understanding (e.g., for network log analysis), decoder-only models like GPT specialize in autoregressive generation (e.g., for customer service chatbots). The full encoder-decoder structure is particularly effective for tasks requiring both input understanding and output generation, such as translating telecom protocols or troubleshooting guides.”\n- “Innovations like sparse attention [9] reduce quadratic complexity, while mixture-of-experts (MoE) models activate subsets of parameters per input, optimizing resource use.”\n- “Parameter-efficient variants, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) [70], enable lightweight fine-tuning—critical for deploying LLMs on edge devices in telecom networks [6].” (implicitly contrasted with full fine-tuning)\n- “Despite their strengths, Transformer-based LLMs face challenges: — Sequence Length Limits: Quadratic attention complexity hinders processing of ultra-long sequences… — Interpretability: Attention weights often lack human-aligned explanations…” (implicit contrast to desired properties or alternative approaches)\n\nWhy not higher:\n- Missing clearly stated similarities across methods, explicit pros/cons lists, and quantified trade-offs tied to telecom metrics (latency, throughput, energy).\n- Comparisons are not organized into a multi-dimensional framework; most contrastive points are single-sentence and generic rather than deeply technical within telecom constraints.", "Score: 4/5\n\nEvidence of explicit analytical reasoning (why differences arise, design trade-offs, limitations, implications):\n- “While techniques like model quantization and compression offer partial solutions, they often trade efficiency for accuracy—a critical tension in latency-sensitive telecom environments.” [1.4] → Clear efficiency–accuracy trade-off framed in an operational context.\n- “Privacy-preserving techniques like federated learning and differential privacy introduce additional complexity, as they may degrade model performance or increase computational costs—a challenge particularly acute under strict regulations like GDPR.” [1.4] → Explains costs of privacy and regulatory constraints.\n- “Edge computing and federated learning offer pathways to decentralization but introduce challenges like bandwidth constraints and synchronization overhead. Moreover, abrupt network shifts … require LLMs to adapt dynamically without compromising stability.” [1.4] → Identifies limits and operational implications of decentralization.\n- “Transformers can approximate gradient descent when processing in-context examples, explaining their remarkable few-shot adaptation capabilities.” [1.2] → Mechanistic explanation for emergent capability (why).\n- “Studies demonstrate that many attention heads learn simple positional patterns, suggesting that fixed attention configurations can maintain performance while reducing overhead.” [1.2] → Design implication and efficiency trade-off.\n- “The Mamba architecture implements selective state space models to achieve linear-time sequence modeling, offering compelling advantages for real-time network monitoring and analysis.” [1.2] → Architectural choice justified by latency constraints (why it fits telecom).\n- “Compression can inadvertently amplify biases… while heterogeneous infrastructures demand modular designs.” [2.4] → Side-effects/risks of optimization and system implications.\n- “In zero-shot scenarios… performance can degrade if the provided examples are ambiguous or if the task deviates significantly from its pre-training distribution.” [2.3] → Explains failure modes (why performance drops).\n- “A significant advantage of RAG in telecom is its ability to reduce hallucinations by anchoring responses in verified sources.” [3.1] → Causal mitigation logic for hallucination.\n- “Hybrid pipelines … while fine-tuning alone struggles with rapidly evolving information, and RAG introduces latency, their integration balances adaptability with efficiency.” [3.5] → Explicit trade-off and rationale for combination.\n- “Edge-based RAG faces challenges in synchronizing distributed knowledge bases and maintaining retrieval accuracy under resource constraints.” [3.6] → Operational limitations of a proposed solution.\n- “Real-time network operations demand low-latency decisions, yet most explainability techniques introduce computational overhead.” [7.3] → Latency–explainability trade-off.\n- “LLMs’ generative nature introduces risks in mission-critical scenarios … where inaccuracies could lead to operational failures.” [6.3/5.4] → Implications of hallucination in high-stakes tasks.\n- “The environmental burden … over-parameterization … edge devices draw power from carbon-intensive sources—highlighting the need for co-optimized energy and performance strategies.” [5.6] → Nuanced sustainability implication and unintended consequences.\n- “The FCC’s nondiscrimination principles counter potential biases in LLM-driven traffic management … skewed attention patterns may perpetuate inequities.” [7.2] → Links technical behavior to legal/regulatory risk (implication).\n- “Quantized models, despite their efficiency gains, are particularly susceptible to adversarial perturbations… dataset contamination by LLM-generated content.” [6.5] → Identifies vulnerabilities introduced by optimization and evaluation threats.\n\nWhy not a 5:\n- While the survey consistently surfaces trade-offs and implications across privacy, latency, bias, and sustainability, many arguments remain high-level. Mechanistic depth (e.g., ablation-backed causality, quantified breakpoints, or formal treatment of telecom-specific constraints) is often asserted via citations rather than developed in-text.\n- Several claims could benefit from deeper “why” analyses tied to telecom data characteristics (e.g., concrete discussions of non-IID drift in FL at RAN-level, or quantifiable latency budgets vs. architectural choices).\n- Benchmark- and metric-driven critiques are present but not always carried through with concrete, comparative evidence; some sections generalize cross-domain insights without rigorous telecom-specific counterfactuals.\n\nResearch guidance value:\n- High. The text repeatedly identifies actionable trade-offs (efficiency–accuracy, privacy–utility, latency–explainability), surfaces concrete failure modes (hallucination under distribution shift; synchronization overhead in edge/FL), and motivates hybrid solutions (RAG+PEFT; edge–cloud splits; multimodal fusion with graph/topology). It provides clear pointers on where to investigate (e.g., sparse/SSM architectures for long logs; federated PEFT under non-IID; interpretable RAG for compliance), though it would be strengthened by more telecom-specific quantitative case studies and standardized experimental protocols.", "Score: 4/5\n\nJustification:\nThe survey identifies several major research gaps across techniques, deployment, and governance, and it often states causes and likely impacts. However, the analysis is generally concise and dispersed across sections rather than synthesized into a dedicated, in-depth “Research Gaps” treatment. Many gaps are clearly stated, but root-cause analysis and quantified impact assessments are limited, which warrants a slight downgrade from the top score.\n\nRepresentative gap statements (with explicit quotes) and brief notes on cause/impact:\n\n- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) gaps\n  - “A key challenge lies in handling the heterogeneity of telecom data formats, from structured tables to unstructured logs.”  \n    Cause: heterogeneous modalities; Impact: retrieval errors and incomplete context for generation.\n  - “Maintaining the relevance of retrieved documents is another critical consideration, given the dynamic nature of telecom networks.”  \n    Cause: frequent updates; Impact: stale/irrelevant evidence harming accuracy.\n  - “Despite its potential, RAG faces challenges in telecom, including retrieval corpus quality and computational overhead.”  \n    Cause: incomplete/biased corpora and heavy compute; Impact: degraded precision and latency.\n  - “Incomplete or biased datasets can degrade retrieval performance, underscoring the need for high-quality, human-annotated data.”  \n    Cause: data bias/quality; Impact: factual errors and unfair outcomes.\n\n- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) gaps\n  - “Three key challenges persist: 1.

Several recommendations are high level (e.g., “Future research should focus on interpretable RAG systems”), and empirical evidence for impacts is sparse.
