Theoretical results show that both are Turing-complete and can represent any context-free language (CFL).In practice, it is often observed that Transformer models have better representation power than LSTM. But the reason is barely understood. We study such practical differences between LSTM and Transformer and propose an explanation based on their latent space decomposition patterns. To achieve this goal, we introduce an oracle training paradigm, which forces the decomposition of the latent representation of LSTM and the Transformer and supervises with the transitions of the Pushdown Automaton (PDA) of the corresponding CFL. With the forced decomposition, we show that the performance upper bounds of LSTM and Transformer in learning CFL are close: both of them can simulate a stack and perform stack operation along with state transitions. However, the absence of forced decomposition leads to the failure of LSTM models to capture the stack and stack operations, while having a marginal impact on the Transformer model. Lastly, we connect the experiment on the prototypical PDA to a real-world parsing task to re-verify the conclusions"}

Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences.

In this study, we present Timely Generative Pre-trained Transformer (TimelyGPT).

It also integrates recurrent attention and temporal convolution modules to effectively capture global-local temporal dependencies. We evaluated TimelyGPT on two large-scale healthcare time series datasets corresponding to continuous biosignals and irregularly-sampled time series, respectively. Our experiments show that during pre-training, TimelyGPT excels in learning time-series representations from continuously monitored biosignals and irregularly-sampled time series data commonly observed in longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs). In forecasting continuous biosignals, TimelyGPT achieves accurate extrapolation up to 6,000 timesteps of body temperature during the sleep stage transition, given a short look-up window (i.e., prompt) containing only 2,000 timesteps.

Probing experiments reveal that such models acquire an implicit notion of absolute positions throughout the network, effectively compensating for the missing information.

These models have impacted numerous domains, from healthcare to education, enhancing productivity, decision-making processes, and accessibility. As a result, they have influenced and, to some extent, reshaped people's lifestyles. However, the quadratic complexity of attention in transformer architectures poses a challenge when scaling up these models for processing long textual contexts. This issue makes it impractical to train very large models on lengthy texts or use them efficiently during inference. While a recent study by [KMZ23] introduced a technique that replaces the softmax with a polynomial function and polynomial sketching to speed up attention mechanisms, the theoretical understandings of this new approach are not yet well understood. In this paper, we offer a theoretical analysis of the expressive capabilities of polynomial attention. Our study reveals a disparity in the ability of high-degree and low-degree polynomial attention. Specifically, we construct two carefully designed datasets, namely $\\mathcal{D}_0$ and $\\mathcal{D}_1$, where $\\mathcal{D}_1$ includes a feature with a significantly larger value compared to $\\mathcal{D}_0$. We demonstrate that with a sufficiently high degree $β$, a single-layer polynomial attention network can distinguish between $\\mathcal{D}_0$ and $\\mathcal{D}_1$. However, with a low degree $β$, the network cannot effectively separate the two datasets. This analysis underscores the greater effectiveness of high-degree polynomials in amplifying large values and distinguishing between datasets. Our analysis offers insight into the representational capacity of polynomial attention and provides a rationale for incorporating higher-degree polynomials in attention mechanisms to capture intricate linguistic correlations."}

The attention mechanism in the Transformer architecture is a critical component of LLMs, as it allows the model to selectively focus on specific input parts. The softmax unit, which is a key part of the attention mechanism, normalizes the attention scores. Hence, the performance of LLMs in various NLP tasks depends significantly on the crucial role played by the attention mechanism with the softmax unit. In-context learning, as one of the celebrated abilities of recent LLMs, is an important concept in querying LLMs such as ChatGPT. Without further parameter updates, Transformers can learn to predict based on few in-context examples. However, the reason why Transformers becomes in-context learners is not well understood. Recently, several works [ASA+22,GTLV22,ONR+22] have studied the in-context learning from a mathematical perspective based on a linear regression formulation $\\min_x\\| Ax - b \\|_2$, which show Transformers' capability of learning linear functions in context.

In particular, we study Syntactic Attention Structure (SAS), a naturally emerging property of MLMs wherein specific Transformer heads tend to focus on specific syntactic relations. We identify a brief window in pretraining when models abruptly acquire SAS, concurrent with a steep drop in loss. This breakthrough precipitates the subsequent acquisition of linguistic capabilities. We then examine the causal role of SAS by manipulating SAS during training, and demonstrate that SAS is necessary for the development of grammatical capabilities. We further find that SAS competes with other beneficial traits during training, and that briefly suppressing SAS improves model quality.

In this paper, we propose to replace all but one attention head of each encoder layer with simple fixed -- non-learnable -- attentive patterns that are solely based on position and do not require any external knowledge.

Our system involves leveraging a web crawler to gather information from websites, generating prompts for LLMs based on the crawled data, and then retrieving the detection results from the responses generated by the LLMs. The system enables us to detect multilingual phishing sites with high accuracy by identifying impersonated brands and social engineering techniques in the context of the entire website, without the need to train machine learning models. To evaluate the performance of our system, we conducted experiments on our own dataset and compared it with baseline systems and several LLMs. The experimental results using GPT-4V demonstrated outstanding performance, with a precision of 98.7% and a recall of 99.6%, outperforming the detection results of other LLMs and existing systems. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs for protecting users from online fraudulent activities and have important implications for enhancing cybersecurity measures."}

With a wealth of knowledge and expertise, large language models (LLMs) are one of the most promising candidates. This paper aims to pave the way for constructing domain-adapted LLMs for networking. Firstly, we present potential LLM applications for vertical network fields and showcase the mapping from natural language to network language. Then, several enabling technologies are investigated, including parameter-efficient finetuning and prompt engineering. The insight is that language understanding and tool usage are both required for network LLMs. Driven by the idea of embodied intelligence, we propose the ChatNet, a domain-adapted network LLM framework with access to various external network tools. ChatNet can reduce the time required for burdensome network planning tasks significantly, leading to a substantial improvement in efficiency.

However, the deployment of these sophisticated models is often hampered by their substantial size and computational demands, raising concerns about their viability in resource-constrained environments. Addressing this challenge, recent advancements have seen the emergence of small language models that surprisingly exhibit performance comparable to their larger counterparts in many tasks, such as coding and common-sense reasoning. Phi-2, a compact yet powerful model, exemplifies this new wave of efficient small language models. This paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of Phi-2's intrinsic understanding of the telecommunications domain. Recognizing the scale-related limitations, we enhance Phi-2's capabilities through a Retrieval-Augmented Generation approach, meticulously integrating an extensive knowledge base specifically curated with telecom standard specifications. The enhanced Phi-2 model demonstrates a profound improvement in accuracy, answering questions about telecom standards with a precision that closely rivals the more resource-intensive GPT-3.5.

However, given their multimodality, the status quo cloud-based deployment faces some critical challenges: 1) long response time; 2) high bandwidth costs; and 3) the violation of data privacy. 6G mobile edge computing (MEC) systems may resolve these pressing issues. In this article, we explore the potential of deploying LLMs at the 6G edge. We start by introducing killer applications powered by multimodal LLMs, including robotics and healthcare, to highlight the need for deploying LLMs in the vicinity of end users. Then, we identify the critical challenges for LLM deployment at the edge and envision the 6G MEC architecture for LLMs. Furthermore, we delve into two design aspects, i.e., edge training and edge inference for LLMs. In both aspects, considering the inherent resource limitations at the edge, we discuss various cutting-edge techniques, including split learning/inference, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, quantization, and parameter-sharing inference, to facilitate the efficient deployment of LLMs. This article serves as a position paper for thoroughly identifying the motivation, challenges, and pathway for empowering LLMs at the 6G edge."}

Additionally, users may have privacy concerns when interacting with remote LLMs. In this paper, we envision a decentralized system unlocking the potential vast untapped consumer-level GPUs in pre-training, inference and fine-tuning of LLMs with privacy protection. However, this system faces critical challenges, including limited CPU and GPU memory, low network bandwidth, the variability of peer and device heterogeneity. To address these challenges, our system design incorporates: 1) a broker with backup pool to implement dynamic join and quit of computing providers; 2) task scheduling with hardware performance to improve system efficiency; 3) abstracting ML procedures into directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to achieve model and task universality; 4) abstracting intermediate represention and execution planes to ensure compatibility of various devices and deep learning (DL) frameworks.

Security, reliability, and vulnerability mitigation techniques span from network security measures to hardware protection, with an increased interest towards formal verification of trained ML models. This paper summarizes the prominent vulnerabilities of modern ML systems, highlights successful defenses and mitigation techniques against these vulnerabilities, both at the cloud (i.e., during the ML training phase) and edge (i.e., during the ML inference stage), discusses the implications of a resource-constrained design on the reliability and security of the system, identifies verification methodologies to ensure correct system behavior, and describes open research challenges for building secure and reliable ML systems at both the edge and the cloud."}

Unfortunately, the benefits of adaptivity may degrade when training with differential privacy, as the noise added to ensure privacy reduces the effectiveness of the adaptive preconditioner. To this end, we propose AdaDPS, a general framework that uses non-sensitive side information to precondition the gradients, allowing the effective use of adaptive methods in private settings. We formally show AdaDPS reduces the amount of noise needed to achieve similar privacy guarantees, thereby improving optimization performance. Empirically, we leverage simple and readily available side information to explore the performance of AdaDPS in practice, comparing to strong baselines in both centralized and federated settings. Our results show that AdaDPS improves accuracy by 7.7% (absolute) on average -- yielding state-of-the-art privacy-utility trade-offs on large-scale text and image benchmarks."}

A prominent approach to mitigate the domain gap is domain adaptation, where a model trained on a source domain is adapted to a new target domain. We present a new learning setup, ``domain adaptation from scratch'', which we believe to be crucial for extending the reach of NLP to sensitive domains in a privacy-preserving manner. In this setup, we aim to efficiently annotate data from a set of source domains such that the trained model performs well on a sensitive target domain from which data is unavailable for annotation. Our study compares several approaches for this challenging setup, ranging from data selection and domain adaptation algorithms to active learning paradigms, on two NLP tasks: sentiment analysis and Named Entity Recognition. Our results suggest that using the abovementioned approaches eases the domain gap, and combining them further improves the results."}

That is, after alignment, each source sample is expected to become similar to any target sample. However, global alignment may not always be optimal or necessary in practice. For example, consider cross-domain fraud detection, where there are two types of transactions: credit and non-credit. Aligning credit and non-credit transactions separately may yield better performance than global alignment, as credit transactions are unlikely to exhibit patterns similar to non-credit transactions. To enable such fine-grained domain adaption, we propose a novel Knowledge-Inspired Subdomain Adaptation (KISA) framework. In particular, (1) We provide the theoretical insight that KISA minimizes the shared expected loss which is the premise for the success of domain adaptation methods. (2) We propose the knowledge-inspired subdomain division problem that plays a crucial role in fine-grained domain adaption. (3) We design a knowledge fusion network to exploit diverse domain knowledge.

This has led to the creation of multiple algorithms that endeavor to mitigate bias. However, it is not clear how effective these methods are. This is because study protocols differ among papers, systems are tested on datasets that fail to test many forms of bias, and systems have access to hidden knowledge or are tuned specifically to the test set. To address this, we introduce an improved evaluation protocol, sensible metrics, and a new dataset, which enables us to ask and answer critical questions about bias mitigation algorithms. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art algorithms using the same network architecture and hyperparameter selection policy across three benchmark datasets. We introduce a new dataset called Biased MNIST that enables assessment of robustness to multiple bias sources. We use Biased MNIST and a visual question answering (VQA) benchmark to assess robustness to hidden biases. Rather than only tuning to the test set distribution, we study robustness across different tuning distributions, which is critical because for many applications the test distribution may not be known during development. We find that algorithms exploit hidden biases, are unable to scale to multiple forms of bias, and are highly sensitive to the choice of tuning set. Based on our findings, we implore the community to adopt more rigorous assessment of future bias mitigation methods.

In this paper, we argue that: not storing any sensitive data is the best form of security. Thus we propose an online framework that \"burns after reading\", i.e. each online sample is immediately deleted after it is processed. Meanwhile, we tackle the inevitable distribution shift between the labeled public data and unlabeled private data as a problem of unsupervised domain adaptation. Specifically, we propose a novel algorithm that aims at the most fundamental challenge of the online adaptation setting--the lack of diverse source-target data pairs. Therefore, we design a Cross-Domain Bootstrapping approach, called CroDoBo, to increase the combined diversity across domains. Further, to fully exploit the valuable discrepancies among the diverse combinations, we employ the training strategy of multiple learners with co-supervision. CroDoBo achieves state-of-the-art online performance on four domain adaptation benchmarks."}

Hence, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that cannot afford the cost of creating large task-specific training datasets, but also the cost of pretraining their own LLMs, are increasingly turning to third-party services that allow them to prompt LLMs. However, such services currently require a payment per call, which becomes a significant operating expense (OpEx). Furthermore, customer inputs are often very similar over time, hence SMEs end-up prompting LLMs with very similar instances. We propose a framework that allows reducing the calls to LLMs by caching previous LLM responses and using them to train a local inexpensive model on the SME side. The framework includes criteria for deciding when to trust the local model or call the LLM, and a methodology to tune the criteria and measure the tradeoff between performance and cost. For experimental purposes, we instantiate our framework with two LLMs, GPT-3.5 or GPT-4, and two inexpensive students, a k-NN classifier or a Multi-Layer Perceptron, using two common business tasks, intent recognition and sentiment analysis.

In this paper, we present a case study of building text analysis applications that perform multiple classification tasks efficiently in 12 languages in the nascent business area of experience management. In order to scale up modern ML methods on experience data, we leverage cross lingual and multi-task modeling techniques to consolidate our models into a single deployment to avoid overhead. We also make use of model compression and model distillation to reduce overall inference latency and hardware cost to the level acceptable for business needs while maintaining model prediction quality. Our findings show that multi-task modeling improves task performance for a subset of experience management tasks in both XLM-R and mBert architectures.

In contrast, LLMs typically demand considerably less data while maintaining an exhaustive world knowledge about each item, such as movies or products. In this paper, we conduct a thorough examination of both CF and LLMs within the classic task of user rating prediction, which involves predicting a user's rating for a candidate item based on their past ratings. We investigate various LLMs in different sizes, ranging from 250M to 540B parameters and evaluate their performance in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning scenarios. We conduct comprehensive analysis to compare between LLMs and strong CF methods, and find that zero-shot LLMs lag behind traditional recommender models that have the access to user interaction data, indicating the importance of user interaction data.

Work in this area largely centres around the 'HHH' criteria: making outputs more helpful and honest, and avoiding harmful (biased, toxic, or inaccurate) statements. Whilst this semantic focus is useful when viewing LLM agents as mere mediums or output-generating systems, it fails to account for pragmatic factors that can make the same speech act seem more or less tactless or inconsiderate in different social situations. With the push towards agentic AI, wherein systems become increasingly proactive in chasing goals and performing actions in the world, considering the pragmatics of interaction becomes essential. We propose an interactional approach to ethics that is centred on relational and situational factors. We explore what it means for a system, as a social actor, to treat an individual respectfully in a (series of) interaction(s).

Second, we have the model generate stories about individuals who hold different types of occupations. We collect >10k sentence completions made by a publicly available LLM, which we subject to human annotation. We find bias across minoritized groups, but in particular in the domains of gender and sexuality, as well as Western bias, in model generations. The model not only reflects societal biases, but appears to amplify them. The model is additionally overly cautious in replies to queries relating to minoritized groups, providing responses that strongly emphasize diversity and equity to an extent that other group characteristics are overshadowed. This suggests that artificially constraining potentially harmful outputs may itself lead to harm, and should be applied in a careful and controlled manner."}

While there is an extensive body of legal and policy work addressing these challenges from a different angle, that is not the focus of our survey. Nevertheless, these works, along with recent legal developments do inform how these technical problems are formalized, and so we discuss them briefly in Section 1. While we have made our best effort to include all the relevant work, due to the fast moving nature of this research we may have missed some recent work. If we have missed some of your work please contact us, as we will attempt to keep this survey relatively up to date. We are maintaining a repository with the list of papers covered in this survey and any relevant code that was publicly available at https://github.com/safr-ml-lab/survey-llm."}

While many forms of design knowledge have been proposed and described, we focus explicitly on knowledge that has been codified as \"methods,\" which we define as any supports for everyday work practices of designers. In this paper, we identify, analyze, and map a collection of 63 existing ethics-focused methods intentionally designed for ethical impact. We present a content analysis, providing a descriptive record of how they operationalize ethics, their intended audience or context of use, their \"core\" or \"script,\" and the means by which these methods are formulated, articulated, and languaged. Building on these results, we provide an initial definition of ethics-focused methods, identifying potential opportunities for the development of future methods to support design practice and research."}

Despite their potential benefits, researchers have underscored various ethical implications. While individual instances have drawn much attention, the debate lacks a systematic overview of practical applications currently researched and ethical issues connected to them. Against this background, this work aims to map the ethical landscape surrounding the current stage of deployment of LLMs in medicine and healthcare. Electronic databases and preprint servers were queried using a comprehensive search strategy. Studies were screened and extracted following a modified rapid review approach. Methodological quality was assessed using a hybrid approach. For 53 records, a meta-aggregative synthesis was performed. Four fields of applications emerged and testify to a vivid exploration phase. Advantages of using LLMs are attributed to their capacity in data analysis, personalized information provisioning, support in decision-making, mitigating information loss and enhancing information accessibility. However, we also identifies recurrent ethical concerns connected to fairness, bias, non-maleficence, transparency, and privacy. A distinctive concern is the tendency to produce harmful misinformation or convincingly but inaccurate content. A recurrent plea for ethical guidance and human oversight is evident. Given the variety of use cases, it is suggested that the ethical guidance debate be reframed to focus on defining what constitutes acceptable human oversight across the spectrum of applications. This involves considering diverse settings, varying potentials for harm, and different acceptable thresholds for performance and certainty in healthcare. In addition, a critical inquiry is necessary to determine the extent to which the current experimental use of LLMs is necessary and justified."}

Healthcare faces existing challenges including the balance of power in clinician-patient relationships, systemic health disparities, historical injustices, and economic constraints. Drawing directly from the voices of those most affected, and focusing on a case study of a specific healthcare setting, we propose a set of guiding principles for the use of NLP in maternal healthcare. We led an interactive session centered on an LLM-based chatbot demonstration during a full-day workshop with 39 participants, and additionally surveyed 30 healthcare workers and 30 birthing people about their values, needs, and perceptions of NLP tools in the context of maternal health. We conducted quantitative and qualitative analyses of the survey results and interactive discussions to consolidate our findings into a set of guiding principles. We propose nine principles for ethical use of NLP for maternal healthcare, grouped into three themes: (i) recognizing contextual significance (ii) holistic measurements, and (iii) who/what is valued. For each principle, we describe its underlying rationale and provide practical advice. This set of principles can provide a methodological pattern for other researchers and serve as a resource to practitioners working on maternal health and other healthcare fields to emphasize the importance of technical nuance, historical context, and inclusive design when developing NLP technologies for clinical use."}

However, relying on LLMs for legal queries raises concerns due to the significant expertise required and the potential real-world consequences of the advice. To explore \\textit{when} and \\textit{why} LLMs should or should not provide advice to users, we conducted workshops with 20 legal experts using methods inspired by case-based reasoning. The provided realistic queries (\"cases\") allowed experts to examine granular, situation-specific concerns and overarching technical and legal constraints, producing a concrete set of contextual considerations for LLM developers. By synthesizing the factors that impacted LLM response appropriateness, we present a 4-dimension framework: (1) User attributes and behaviors, (2) Nature of queries, (3) AI capabilities, and (4) Social impacts. We share experts' recommendations for LLM response strategies, which center around helping users identify `right questions to ask' and relevant information rather than providing definitive legal judgments. Our findings reveal novel legal considerations, such as unauthorized practice of law, confidentiality, and liability for inaccurate advice, that have been overlooked in the literature. The case-based deliberation method enabled us to elicit fine-grained, practice-informed insights that surpass those from de-contextualized surveys or speculative principles. These findings underscore the applicability of our method for translating domain-specific professional knowledge and practices into policies that can guide LLM behavior in a more responsible direction."}

While these principles are crucial for ethical data stewardship, their specific application in the context of LLM training data remains an under-explored area. This research gap is the focus of our study, which begins with an examination of existing literature to underline the importance of FAIR principles in managing data for LLM training. Building upon this, we propose a novel framework designed to integrate FAIR principles into the LLM development lifecycle. A contribution of our work is the development of a comprehensive checklist intended to guide researchers and developers in applying FAIR data principles consistently across the model development process. The utility and effectiveness of our framework are validated through a case study on creating a FAIR-compliant dataset aimed at detecting and mitigating biases in LLMs. We present this framework to the community as a tool to foster the creation of technologically advanced, ethically grounded, and socially responsible AI models."}

To date, research on these privacy concerns has been model-centered: exploring how LLMs lead to privacy risks like memorization, or can be used to infer personal characteristics about people from their content. We argue that there is a need for more research focusing on the human aspect of these privacy issues: e.g., research on how design paradigms for LLMs affect users' disclosure behaviors, users' mental models and preferences for privacy controls, and the design of tools, systems, and artifacts that empower end-users to reclaim ownership over their personal data. To build usable, efficient, and privacy-friendly systems powered by these models with imperfect privacy properties, our goal is to initiate discussions to outline an agenda for conducting human-centered research on privacy issues in LLM-powered systems. This Special Interest Group (SIG) aims to bring together researchers with backgrounds in usable security and privacy, human-AI collaboration, NLP, or any other related domains to share their perspectives and experiences on this problem, to help our community establish a collective understanding of the challenges, research opportunities, research methods, and strategies to collaborate with researchers outside of HCI."}

While the level in which LLMs has not reached a level where it has surpassed human intelligence, there will be a time when it will. Such LLMs can be referred to as advanced LLMs. Currently, there are limited usage of ethical artificial intelligence (AI) principles and guidelines addressing advanced LLMs due to the fact that we have not reached that point yet. However, this is a problem as once we do reach that point, we will not be adequately prepared to deal with the aftermath of it in an ethical and optimal way, which will lead to undesired and unexpected consequences. This paper addresses this issue by discussing what ethical AI principles and guidelines can be used to address highly advanced LLMs."}

Going beyond text, image and graphics, LLMs present a significant potential for analysis of time series data, benefiting domains such as climate, IoT, healthcare, traffic, audio and finance.

One of the factors attributed to the effectiveness of LLMs is the model architecture used for training, transformers. Transformer models excel at capturing contextual features in sequential data since time series data are sequential, transformer models can be leveraged for more efficient time series data prediction. The field of prognostics is vital to system health management and proper maintenance planning. A reliable estimation of the remaining useful life (RUL) of machines holds the potential for substantial cost savings. This includes avoiding abrupt machine failures, maximizing equipment usage, and serving as a decision support system (DSS). This work proposed an encoder-transformer architecture-based framework for multivariate time series prediction for a prognostics use case. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed framework on all four sets of the C-MAPPS benchmark dataset for the remaining useful life prediction task. To effectively transfer the knowledge and application of transformers from the natural language domain to time series, three model-specific experiments were conducted. Also, to enable the model awareness of the initial stages of the machine life and its degradation path, a novel expanding window method was proposed for the first time in this work, it was compared with the sliding window method, and it led to a large improvement in the performance of the encoder transformer model. Finally, the performance of the proposed encoder-transformer model was evaluated on the test dataset and compared with the results from 13 other state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in the literature and it outperformed them all with an average performance increase of 137.65% over the next best model across all the datasets."}

Contemporary efforts in this field primarily aim to enhance model capabilities by scaling up both the architecture and data volumes utilized during training. However, the exploration into reduce these model sizes while preserving their efficacy remains scant. In this study, we introduce three modifications to the decoder-only transformer architecture, namely ParallelGPT (pgpt), LinearGPT (lgpt), and ConvGPT (cgpt). These variants demonstrate comparable performance to the conventional architecture in language generation, yet benefit from reduced model sizes and faster training processes. We open-source the model weights and the complete codebase for these implementation for further research."}

The computation workload and the memory footprint grow quadratically with the dimension (layer width). Most of LLMs' parameters come from the linear layers of the transformer structure and are highly redundant. These linear layers contribute more than 80% of the computation workload and 99% of the model size. To pretrain and finetune LLMs efficiently, there are three major challenges to address: 1) reducing redundancy of the linear layers; 2) reducing GPU memory footprint; 3) improving GPU utilization when using distributed training. Prior methods, such as LoRA and QLoRA, utilized low-rank matrices and quantization to reduce the number of trainable parameters and model size, respectively. However, the resulting model still consumes a large amount of GPU memory. In this paper, we present high-performance GPU-based methods that exploit low-rank structures to pretrain and finetune LLMs for financial applications. We replace one conventional linear layer of the transformer structure with two narrower linear layers, which allows us to reduce the number of parameters by several orders of magnitude. By quantizing the parameters into low precision (8-bit and 4-bit), the memory consumption of the resulting model is further reduced. Compared with existing LLMs, our methods achieve a speedup of 1.3X and a model compression ratio of 2.64X for pretaining without accuracy drop. For finetuning, our methods achieve an average accuracy increase of 6.3% and 24.0% in general tasks and financial tasks, respectively, and GPU memory consumption ratio of 6.3X. The sizes of our models are smaller than 0.59 GB, allowing inference on a smartphone."}

Like RNN, Transformer is designed to handle the sequential data. As Transformer achieved great success in Natural Language Processing (NLP), researchers got interested in Transformer's performance on time series prediction, and plenty of Transformer-based solutions on long time series forecasting have come out recently. However, when it comes to financial time series prediction, LSTM is still a dominant architecture. Therefore, the question this study wants to answer is: whether the Transformer-based model can be applied in financial time series prediction and beat LSTM. To answer this question, various LSTM-based and Transformer-based models are compared on multiple financial prediction tasks based on high-frequency limit order book data. A new LSTM-based model called DLSTM is built and new architecture for the Transformer-based model is designed to adapt for financial prediction. The experiment result reflects that the Transformer-based model only has the limited advantage in absolute price sequence prediction. The LSTM-based models show better and more robust performance on difference sequence prediction, such as price difference and price movement."}

Over the past few years, deep learning models especially Transformers have achieved advanced performance in LTSF tasks. However, LTSF faces inherent challenges such as long-term dependencies capturing and sparse semantic characteristics. Recently, a new state space model (SSM) named Mamba is proposed. With the selective capability on input data and the hardware-aware parallel computing algorithm, Mamba has shown great potential in balancing predicting performance and computational efficiency compared to Transformers. To enhance Mamba's ability to preserve historical information in a longer range, we design a novel Mamba+ block by adding a forget gate inside Mamba to selectively combine the new features with the historical features in a complementary manner. Furthermore, we apply Mamba+ both forward and backward and propose Bi-Mamba+, aiming to promote the model's ability to capture interactions among time series elements. Additionally, multivariate time series data in different scenarios may exhibit varying emphasis on intra- or inter-series dependencies. Therefore, we propose a series-relation-aware decider that controls the utilization of channel-independent or channel-mixing tokenization strategy for specific datasets. Extensive experiments on 8 real-world datasets show that our model achieves more accurate predictions compared with state-of-the-art methods."}

The self-attention module is the most dominating sub-structure inside Transformer-based LLMs. Computation using general-purpose graphics processing units (GPUs) inflicts reckless demand for I/O bandwidth for transferring intermediate calculation results between memories and processing units. To tackle this challenge, this work develops a fully customized vanilla self-attention accelerator, AttentionLego, as the basic building block for constructing spatially expandable LLM processors. AttentionLego provides basic implementation with fully-customized digital logic incorporating Processing-In-Memory (PIM) technology.

Your Attention is Naturally $n^C$-Sparse", "abstract": "Sparse Attention is a technique that approximates standard attention computation with sub-quadratic complexity. This is achieved by selectively ignoring smaller entries in the attention matrix during the softmax function computation. Variations of this technique, such as pruning KV cache, sparsity-based fast attention, and Sparse Transformer, have been extensively utilized for efficient Large Language Models (LLMs) deployment. Despite its widespread use, a theoretical understanding of the conditions under which sparse attention performs on par with traditional attention remains elusive. This work aims to $\\textbf{bridge this gap by examining the inherent sparsity of standard attention processes}$. Our theoretical framework reveals several brand-new key insights: $\\bullet$ Attention is $n^{C}$-sparse, implying that considering only the largest $Ω(n^{C})$ entries out of all $n$ entries is sufficient for sparse attention to approximate the exact attention matrix with decreasing loss. Here, $n$ represents the input length and $C \\in (0, 1)$ is a constant. $\\bullet$ Stable $o(\\log(n))$-sparse attention, which approximates attention computation with $\\log(n)$ or fewer entries, may not be feasible since the error will persist at a minimum of $O(1)$. $\\bullet$ An adaptive strategy ($α\\cdot n^C, α\\in \\mathbb{R}$) for the window size of efficient attention methods rather than a fixed one is guaranteed to perform more accurately and efficiently in a task for inference on flexible context lengths."}

Unlike state-of-the-art Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures, which are sequential in nature and tailored to local processing, an attention mechanism provides our architecture with a direct connection to all previous time-steps. Our architecture, an attention-LSTM hybrid, enables us to learn longer-term dependencies, improves performance when considering returns net of transaction costs and naturally adapts to new market regimes, such as during the SARS-CoV-2 crisis. Via the introduction of multiple attention heads, we can capture concurrent regimes, or temporal dynamics, which are occurring at different timescales. The Momentum Transformer is inherently interpretable, providing us with greater insights into our deep-learning momentum trading strategy, including the importance of different factors over time and the past time-steps which are of the greatest significance to the model."}

However, this perspective overlooks the potential benefits derived from multiple iterations involving demonstrations, a practice aligning more closely with the iterative decision-making process exhibited by humans, who often learn through analogy. In this study, we introduce a novel two-stage framework to boost ICL in LLMs. Specifically, our framework delineates the ICL process into two distinct stages: Deep-Thinking and test stages. The Deep-Thinking stage incorporates a unique attention mechanism, i.e., iterative enhanced attention, which enables multiple rounds of information accumulation. This mechanism operates by manipulating the Key-Value matrices without training, fostering enhanced understanding capabilities in LLMs by thinking demonstrations multiple times. We evaluated Deep-Thinking across a range of benchmarks and LLMs, showing its superior performance over vanilla ICL methods and its effectiveness in challenging tasks where demonstration selection is infeasible."}
{"id": "77", "arxiv": "2211.05110v1", "title": "Large Language Models with Controllable Working Memory", "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have led to a series of breakthroughs in natural language processing (NLP), owing to their excellent understanding and generation abilities. Remarkably, what further sets these models apart is the massive amounts of world knowledge they internalize during pretraining. While many downstream applications provide the model with an informational context to aid its performance on the underlying task, how the model's world knowledge interacts with the factual information presented in the context remains under explored. As a desirable behavior, an LLM should give precedence to the context whenever it contains task-relevant information that conflicts with the model's memorized knowledge. This enables model predictions to be grounded in the context, which can then be used to update or correct specific model predictions without frequent retraining. By contrast, when the context is irrelevant to the task, the model should ignore it and fall back on its internal knowledge. In this paper, we undertake a first joint study of the aforementioned two properties, namely controllability and robustness, in the context of LLMs. We demonstrate that state-of-the-art T5 and PaLM (both pretrained and finetuned) could exhibit poor controllability and robustness, which do not scale with increasing model size. As a solution, we propose a novel method - Knowledge Aware FineTuning (KAFT) - to strengthen both controllability and robustness by incorporating counterfactual and irrelevant contexts to standard supervised datasets. Our comprehensive evaluation showcases the utility of KAFT across model architectures and sizes."}

However, existing interaction paradigms between LLMs and users are constrained by either inflexibility, limitations in customization, or a lack of persistent learning. This inflexibility is particularly evident as users, especially those without programming skills, have restricted avenues to enhance or personalize the model. Existing frameworks further complicate the model training and deployment process due to their computational inefficiencies and lack of user-friendly interfaces. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel interaction paradigm-'Online Training using External Interactions'-that merges the benefits of persistent, real-time model updates with the flexibility for individual customization through external interactions such as AI agents or online/offline knowledge bases."}

In addition to yielding gains in predictive accuracy, attention weights are often claimed to confer interpretability, purportedly useful both for providing insights to practitioners and for explaining why a model makes its decisions to stakeholders. We call the latter use of attention mechanisms into question by demonstrating a simple method for training models to produce deceptive attention masks. Our method diminishes the total weight assigned to designated impermissible tokens, even when the models can be shown to nevertheless rely on these features to drive predictions. Across multiple models and tasks, our approach manipulates attention weights while paying surprisingly little cost in accuracy. Through a human study, we show that our manipulated attention-based explanations deceive people into thinking that predictions from a model biased against gender minorities do not rely on the gender. Consequently, our results cast doubt on attention's reliability as a tool for auditing algorithms in the context of fairness and accountability."}

Similar attention structures are also extensively studied in several other areas. Although the attention mechanism enhances the model performances significantly, its quadratic complexity prevents efficient processing of long sequences. Recent works focused on eliminating the disadvantages of computational inefficiency and showed that transformer-based models can still reach competitive results without the attention layer. A pioneering study proposed the FNet, which replaces the attention layer with the Fourier Transform (FT) in the transformer encoder architecture. FNet achieves competitive performances concerning the original transformer encoder model while accelerating training process by removing the computational burden of the attention mechanism. However, the FNet model ignores essential properties of the FT from the classical signal processing that can be leveraged to increase model efficiency further. We propose different methods to deploy FT efficiently in transformer encoder models. Our proposed architectures have smaller number of model parameters, shorter training times, less memory usage, and some additional performance improvements. We demonstrate these improvements through extensive experiments on common benchmarks."}

Due to the direct effect on the revenues of the companies, especially in the telecom field, companies are seeking to develop means to predict potential customer to churn. Therefore, finding factors that increase customer churn is important to take necessary actions to reduce this churn. The main contribution of our work is to develop a churn prediction model which assists telecom operators to predict customers who are most likely subject to churn. The model developed in this work uses machine learning techniques on big data platform and builds a new way of features' engineering and selection. In order to measure the performance of the model, the Area Under Curve (AUC) standard measure is adopted, and the AUC value obtained is 93.3%. Another main contribution is to use customer social network in the prediction model by extracting Social Network Analysis (SNA) features. The use of SNA enhanced the performance of the model from 84 to 93.3% against AUC standard. The model was prepared and tested through Spark environment by working on a large dataset created by transforming big raw data provided by SyriaTel telecom company.

In this work, we are developing intelligent algorithms that mine a huge amount of mobile operator's data and detect the SIMs that are used to bypass international calls. This method will make it hard for fraudsters to generate revenue and hinder their work. Also by reducing fraudulent activities, quality of service can be increased as well as customer satisfaction. Our technique has been evaluated and tested on real world mobile operator data, and proved to be very efficient."}

For example, ChatGPT, the latest black-box LLM, has been investigated by numerous recent research studies and has shown impressive performance in various tasks. However, there exists a potential risk of data leakage since these LLMs are usually close-sourced with unknown specific training details, e.g., pre-training datasets. In this paper, we seek to review the bug-fixing capabilities of ChatGPT on a clean APR benchmark with different research objectives. We first introduce {\\benchmark}, a new benchmark with buggy and the corresponding fixed programs from competitive programming problems starting from 2023, after the training cutoff point of ChatGPT. The results on {\\benchmark} show that ChatGPT is able to fix 109 out of 151 buggy programs using the basic prompt within 35 independent rounds, outperforming state-of-the-art LLMs CodeT5 and PLBART by 27.5\\% and 62.4\\% prediction accuracy. We also investigate the impact of three types of prompts, i.e., problem description, error feedback, and bug localization, leading to additional 34 fixed bugs. Besides, we provide additional discussion from the interactive nature of ChatGPT to illustrate the capacity of a dialog-based repair workflow with 9 additional fixed bugs. Inspired by the findings, we further pinpoint various challenges and opportunities for advanced SE study equipped with such LLMs (e.g.,~ChatGPT) in the near future. More importantly, our work calls for more research on the reevaluation of the achievements obtained by existing black-box LLMs across various SE tasks, not limited to ChatGPT on APR."}

While many real-world applications still require fine-tuning to reach satisfactory levels of performance, many of them are in the low-data regime, making fine-tuning challenging. To address this, we propose LLM2LLM, a targeted and iterative data augmentation strategy that uses a teacher LLM to enhance a small seed dataset by augmenting additional data that can be used for fine-tuning on a specific task. LLM2LLM (1) fine-tunes a baseline student LLM on the initial seed data, (2) evaluates and extracts data points that the model gets wrong, and (3) uses a teacher LLM to generate synthetic data based on these incorrect data points, which are then added back into the training data. This approach amplifies the signal from incorrectly predicted data points by the LLM during training and reintegrates them into the dataset to focus on more challenging examples for the LLM. Our results show that LLM2LLM significantly enhances the performance of LLMs in the low-data regime, outperforming both traditional fine-tuning and other data augmentation baselines. LLM2LLM reduces the dependence on labor-intensive data curation and paves the way for more scalable and performant LLM solutions, allowing us to tackle data-constrained domains and tasks. We achieve improvements up to 24.2% on the GSM8K dataset, 32.6% on CaseHOLD, 32.0% on SNIPS, 52.6% on TREC and 39.8% on SST-2 over regular fine-tuning in the low-data regime using a Llama-2-7B student model.

In this work, we propose a new paradigm of mobile AI: LLM as a system service on mobile devices (LLMaaS). Unlike traditional DNNs that execute in a stateless manner, such a system service is stateful: LLMs execution often needs to maintain persistent states (mainly KV cache) across multiple invocations. To minimize the LLM context switching overhead under tight device memory budget, this work presents LLMS, which decouples the memory management of app and LLM contexts with a key idea of fine-grained, chunk-wise, globally-optimized KV cache compression and swapping. By fully leveraging KV cache's unique characteristics, it proposes three novel techniques: (1) Tolerance-Aware Compression: it compresses chunks based on their measured accuracy tolerance to compression. (2) IO-Recompute Pipelined Loading: it introduces recompute to swapping-in for acceleration. (3) Chunk Lifecycle Management: it optimizes the memory activities of chunks with an ahead-of-time swapping-out and an LCTRU (Least Compression-Tolerable and Recently-Used) queue based eviction. In evaluations conducted on well-established traces and various edge devices, \\sys reduces context switching latency by up to 2 orders of magnitude when compared to competitive baseline solutions."}

They possess deep language comprehension, human-like text generation capabilities, contextual awareness, and robust problem-solving skills, making them invaluable in various domains (e.g., search engines, customer support, translation). In the meantime, LLMs have also gained traction in the security community, revealing security vulnerabilities and showcasing their potential in security-related tasks. This paper explores the intersection of LLMs with security and privacy. Specifically, we investigate how LLMs positively impact security and privacy, potential risks and threats associated with their use, and inherent vulnerabilities within LLMs. Through a comprehensive literature review, the paper categorizes the papers into \"The Good\" (beneficial LLM applications), \"The Bad\" (offensive applications), and \"The Ugly\" (vulnerabilities of LLMs and their defenses). We have some interesting findings. For example, LLMs have proven to enhance code security (code vulnerability detection) and data privacy (data confidentiality protection), outperforming traditional methods. However, they can also be harnessed for various attacks (particularly user-level attacks) due to their human-like reasoning abilities. We have identified areas that require further research efforts. For example, Research on model and parameter extraction attacks is limited and often theoretical, hindered by LLM parameter scale and confidentiality. Safe instruction tuning, a recent development, requires more exploration. We hope that our work can shed light on the LLMs' potential to both bolster and jeopardize cybersecurity."}

This neglects the privacy-preserving policy, that is, all the data and computations must be kept decentralized. There exists three problems in this scenario: (1) Minimizing the domain distance requires the pairwise calculation of the data from source and target domains, which is not accessible. (2) The communication cost and privacy security limit the application of UMDA methods (e.g., the domain adversarial training). (3) Since users have no authority to check the data quality, the irrelevant or malicious source domains are more likely to appear, which causes negative transfer. In this study, we propose a privacy-preserving UMDA paradigm named Knowledge Distillation based Decentralized Domain Adaptation (KD3A), which performs domain adaptation through the knowledge distillation on models from different source domains. KD3A solves the above problems with three components: (1) A multi-source knowledge distillation method named Knowledge Vote to learn high-quality domain consensus knowledge. (2) A dynamic weighting strategy named Consensus Focus to identify both the malicious and irrelevant domains. (3) A decentralized optimization strategy for domain distance named BatchNorm MMD. The extensive experiments on DomainNet demonstrate that KD3A is robust to the negative transfer and brings a 100x reduction of communication cost compared with other decentralized UMDA methods. Moreover, our KD3A significantly outperforms state-of-the-art UMDA approaches."}

The standard UDA requires sharing the source data with the target, having potential data privacy leaking risks. To protect the source data's privacy, we first propose to share the source feature distribution instead of the source data. However, sharing only the source feature distribution may still suffer from the membership inference attack who can infer an individual's membership by the black-box access to the source model. To resolve this privacy issue, we further study the under-explored problem of privacy-preserving domain adaptation and propose a method with a novel differential privacy training strategy to protect the source data privacy. We model the source feature distribution by Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) under the differential privacy setting and send it to the target client for adaptation. The target client resamples differentially private source features from GMMs and adapts on target data with several state-of-art UDA backbones. With our proposed method, the source data provider could avoid leaking source data privacy during domain adaptation as well as reserve the utility. To evaluate our proposed method's utility and privacy loss, we apply our model on a medical report disease label classification task using two noisy challenging clinical text datasets. The results show that our proposed method can preserve source data's privacy with a minor performance influence on the text classification task."}

Because of the distribution shifts, different target samples have distinct degrees of difficulty in adaptation. However, existing domain adaptation approaches overwhelmingly neglect the degrees of difficulty and deploy exactly the same framework for all of the target samples. Generally, a simple or shadow framework is fast but rough. A sophisticated or deep framework, on the contrary, is accurate but slow. In this paper, we aim to challenge the fundamental contradiction between the accuracy and speed in domain adaptation tasks. We propose a novel approach, named {\\it agile domain adaptation}, which agilely applies optimal frameworks to different target samples and classifies the target samples according to their adaptation difficulties. Specifically, we propose a paradigm which performs several early detections before the final classification. If a sample can be classified at one of the early stage with enough confidence, the sample would exit without the subsequent processes. Notably, the proposed method can significantly reduce the running cost of domain adaptation approaches, which can extend the application scenarios of domain adaptation to even mobile devices and real-time systems. Extensive experiments on two open benchmarks verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method."}

While profitable in the short-term, these practices are unsustainable and socially extractive from both a data-use and energy-use perspective. This work proposes an ESG-inspired framework combining socio-technical measures to build eco-socially responsible AI systems. The framework has four pillars: compute-efficient machine learning, federated learning, data sovereignty, and a LEEDesque certificate. Compute-efficient machine learning is the use of compressed network architectures that show marginal decreases in accuracy. Federated learning augments the first pillar's impact through the use of techniques that distribute computational loads across idle capacity on devices. This is paired with the third pillar of data sovereignty to ensure the privacy of user data via techniques like use-based privacy and differential privacy. The final pillar ties all these factors together and certifies products and services in a standardized manner on their environmental and social impacts, allowing consumers to align their purchase with their values."}

Two of the most critical issues are fairness and data privacy. On the one hand, one must guarantee that automated decisions are not biased against certain groups, especially those unprotected or marginalized. On the other hand, one must ensure that the use of personal information fully abides by privacy regulations and that user identities are kept safe. The balance between privacy, fairness, and predictive performance is complex. However, despite their potential societal impact, we still demonstrate a poor understanding of the dynamics between these optimization vectors. In this paper, we study this three-way tension and how the optimization of each vector impacts others, aiming to inform the future development of safe applications. In light of claims that predictive performance and fairness can be jointly optimized, we find this is only possible at the expense of data privacy. Overall, experimental results show that one of the vectors will be penalized regardless of which of the three we optimize. Nonetheless, we find promising avenues for future work in joint optimization solutions, where smaller trade-offs are observed between the three vectors."}

A fundamental challenge is devising the optimal strategy for feature selection. Existing literature is somewhat paradoxical: some advocate for learning invariant features from source domains, while others favor more diverse features. To address the challenge, we propose a statistical framework that distinguishes the utilities of features based on the variance of their correlation to label $y$ across domains. Under our framework, we design and analyze a learning procedure consisting of learning approximately shared feature representation from source tasks and fine-tuning it on the target task. Our theoretical analysis necessitates the importance of learning approximately shared features instead of only the strictly invariant features and yields an improved population risk compared to previous results on both source and target tasks, thus partly resolving the paradox mentioned above. Inspired by our theory, we proposed a more practical way to isolate the content (invariant+approximately shared) from environmental features and further consolidate our theoretical findings."}

Prior work has addressed the high cost of LLM serving by improving the inference engine, but less attention has been given to selecting the most cost-efficient GPU type(s) for a specific LLM service. There is a large and growing landscape of GPU types and, within these options, higher cost does not always lead to increased performance. Instead, through a comprehensive investigation, we find that three key LLM service characteristics (request size, request rate, SLO) strongly influence GPU cost efficiency, and differing GPU types are most cost efficient for differing LLM service settings. As a result, the most cost-efficient allocation for a given service is typically a mix of heterogeneous GPU types. Based on this analysis, we introduce Mélange, a GPU allocation framework that navigates these diverse LLM service characteristics and heterogeneous GPU option space to automatically and efficiently derive the minimal-cost GPU allocation for a given LLM service. We formulate the GPU allocation task as a cost-aware bin packing problem where GPUs are bins and items are slices of the service workload. Our formulation's constraints account for a service's unique characteristics, allowing Mélange to be flexible to support diverse service settings and heterogeneity-aware to adapt the GPU allocation to a specific service. Compared to using only a single GPU type, Mélange reduces deployment costs by up to 77% in conversational settings, 33% in document-based settings, and 51% in a mixed setting."}

However, the widespread use of LLMs is also coupled with significant ethical and social challenges. Previous research has pointed towards auditing as a promising governance mechanism to help ensure that AI systems are designed and deployed in ways that are ethical, legal, and technically robust. However, existing auditing procedures fail to address the governance challenges posed by LLMs, which display emergent capabilities and are adaptable to a wide range of downstream tasks. In this article, we address that gap by outlining a novel blueprint for how to audit LLMs. Specifically, we propose a three-layered approach, whereby governance audits (of technology providers that design and disseminate LLMs), model audits (of LLMs after pre-training but prior to their release), and application audits (of applications based on LLMs) complement and inform each other. We show how audits, when conducted in a structured and coordinated manner on all three levels, can be a feasible and effective mechanism for identifying and managing some of the ethical and social risks posed by LLMs. However, it is important to remain realistic about what auditing can reasonably be expected to achieve. Therefore, we discuss the limitations not only of our three-layered approach but also of the prospect of auditing LLMs at all.

However, their ever-increasing size has raised concerns about their effective deployment and the need for LLM compression. This study introduces the Divergent Token Metrics (DTMs), a novel approach to assessing compressed LLMs, addressing the limitations of traditional perplexity or accuracy measures that fail to accurately reflect text generation quality. DTMs measure token divergences that allow deeper insights into the subtleties of model compression, in particular, when evaluating components' impacts individually. Utilizing the First Divergent Token Metric (FDTM) in model sparsification reveals that 25% of all attention components can be pruned beyond 90% on the Llama-2 model family, still keeping SOTA performance. For quantization, FDTM suggests that more than 80% of parameters can be naively transformed to int8 without special outlier management. These evaluations indicate the necessity of choosing appropriate compressions for parameters individually -- and that FDTM can identify those -- while standard metrics result in deteriorated outcomes."}

Interestingly, in addition to helping obtain state-of-the-art results on a wide range of applications, the attention mechanism intrinsically provides meaningful insights on the internal behavior of the model. Can these insights be used as explanations? Debate rages on. In this paper, we mathematically study a simple attention-based architecture and pinpoint the differences between post-hoc and attention-based explanations. We show that they provide quite different results, and that, despite their limitations, post-hoc methods are capable of capturing more useful insights than merely examining the attention weights."}

Some works suggest that LLMs only recall already learned concepts from pre-training, while others hint that ICL performs implicit learning over demonstrations. We characterize two ways through which ICL leverages demonstrations. Task recognition (TR) captures the extent to which LLMs can recognize a task through demonstrations -- even without ground-truth labels -- and apply their pre-trained priors, whereas task learning (TL) is the ability to capture new input-label mappings unseen in pre-training. Using a wide range of classification datasets and three LLM families (GPT-3, LLaMA and OPT), we design controlled experiments to disentangle the roles of TR and TL in ICL. We show that (1) models can achieve non-trivial performance with only TR, and TR does not further improve with larger models or more demonstrations; (2) LLMs acquire TL as the model scales, and TL's performance consistently improves with more demonstrations in context. Our findings unravel two different forces behind ICL and we advocate for discriminating them in future ICL research due to their distinct nature."}

In-context learning contrasts with traditional in-weights learning of query-output relationships. What aspects of the training data distribution and architecture favor in-context vs in-weights learning? Recent work has shown that specific distributional properties inherent in language, such as burstiness, large dictionaries and skewed rank-frequency distributions, control the trade-off or simultaneous appearance of these two forms of learning. We first show that these results are recapitulated in a minimal attention-only network trained on a simplified dataset. In-context learning (ICL) is driven by the abrupt emergence of an induction head, which subsequently competes with in-weights learning. By identifying progress measures that precede in-context learning and targeted experiments, we construct a two-parameter model of an induction head which emulates the full data distributional dependencies displayed by the attention-based network. A phenomenological model of induction head formation traces its abrupt emergence to the sequential learning of three nested logits enabled by an intrinsic curriculum. We propose that the sharp transitions in attention-based networks arise due to a specific chain of multi-layer operations necessary to achieve ICL, which is implemented by nested nonlinearities sequentially learned during training."}

The inherent complexity of these tasks, coupled with the ever-changing landscape of networking technologies and protocols, poses significant hurdles for traditional machine learning-based methods. These methods often struggle to generalize and automate complex tasks in networking, as they require extensive labeled data, domain-specific feature engineering, and frequent retraining to adapt to new scenarios.

LLMs have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding, generation, and reasoning. These models, trained on extensive data, can benefit the networking domain. Some efforts have already explored the application of LLMs in the networking domain and revealed promising results. By reviewing recent advances, we present an abstract workflow to describe the fundamental process involved in applying LLM for Networking. We introduce the highlights of existing works by category and explain in detail how they operate at different stages of the workflow.

To this end, purpose-specific Machine Learning (ML) models can be used to manage and control physical as well as virtual network resources in a way that is fully compliant to slice Service Level Agreements (SLAs), while also boosting the revenue of the underlying physical network operator(s). This is because specially designed and trained ML models can be both proactive and very effective against slice management issues that can induce significant SLA penalties or runtime costs. However, reaching that point is very challenging. 5G networks will be highly dynamic and complex, offering a large scale of heterogeneous, sophisticated and resource-demanding 5G services as network slices. This raises a need for a well-defined, generic and step-wise roadmap to designing, building and deploying efficient ML models as collaborative components of what can be defined as Cognitive Network and Slice Management (CNSM) 5G systems. To address this need, we take a use case-driven approach to design and present a novel Integrated Methodology for CNSM in virtualized 5G networks based on a concrete eHealth use case, and elaborate on it to derive a generic approach for 5G slice management use cases. The three fundamental components that comprise our proposed methodology include (i) a 5G Cognitive Workflow model that conditions everything from the design up to the final deployment of ML models; (ii) a Four-stage approach to Cognitive Slice Management with an emphasis on anomaly detection; and (iii) a Proactive Control Scheme for the collaboration of different ML models targeting different slice life-cycle management problems."}

Despite the success, the underlying mechanism of this approach remains unexplored, and the true effectiveness of LLMs as Prompt Optimizers requires further validation. In this work, we conducted a comprehensive study to uncover the actual mechanism of LLM-based Prompt Optimization. Our findings reveal that the LLM optimizers struggle to identify the true causes of errors during reflection, tending to be biased by their own prior knowledge rather than genuinely reflecting on the errors. Furthermore, even when the reflection is semantically valid, the LLM optimizers often fail to generate appropriate prompts for the target models with a single prompt refinement step, partly due to the unpredictable behaviors of the target models. Based on the observations, we introduce a new \"Automatic Behavior Optimization\" paradigm, which directly optimizes the target model's behavior in a more controllable manner. We hope our study can inspire new directions for automatic prompt optimization development."}

However, recent efforts on LLMs for wireless networks are limited to a direct application of existing language models that were designed for natural language processing (NLP) applications. To address this challenge and create wireless-centric foundation models, this paper presents a comprehensive vision on how to design universal foundation models that are tailored towards the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI)-native networks. Diverging from NLP-based foundation models, the proposed framework promotes the design of large multi-modal models (LMMs) fostered by three key capabilities: 1) processing of multi-modal sensing data, 2) grounding of physical symbol representations in real-world wireless systems using causal reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and 3) enabling instructibility from the wireless environment feedback to facilitate dynamic network adaptation thanks to logical and mathematical reasoning facilitated by neuro-symbolic AI. In essence, these properties enable the proposed LMM framework to build universal capabilities that cater to various cross-layer networking tasks and alignment of intents across different domains. Preliminary results from experimental evaluation demonstrate the efficacy of grounding using RAG in LMMs, and showcase the alignment of LMMs with wireless system designs. Furthermore, the enhanced rationale exhibited in the responses to mathematical questions by LMMs, compared to vanilla LLMs, demonstrates the logical and mathematical reasoning capabilities inherent in LMMs. Building on those results, we present a sequel of open questions and challenges for LMMs. We then conclude with a set of recommendations that ignite the path towards LMM-empowered AI-native systems."}

Prior DA works show that pretext tasks could be used to mitigate this domain shift by learning domain invariant representations. However, in practice, we find that most existing pretext tasks are ineffective against other established techniques. Thus, we theoretically analyze how and when a subsidiary pretext task could be leveraged to assist the goal task of a given DA problem and develop objective subsidiary task suitability criteria. Based on this criteria, we devise a novel process of sticker intervention and cast sticker classification as a supervised subsidiary DA problem concurrent to the goal task unsupervised DA. Our approach not only improves goal task adaptation performance, but also facilitates privacy-oriented source-free DA i.e. without concurrent source-target access. Experiments on the standard Office-31, Office-Home, DomainNet, and VisDA benchmarks demonstrate our superiority for both single-source and multi-source source-free DA. Our approach also complements existing non-source-free works, achieving leading performance."}

Most DA methods require access to the source data, but often that is not possible (e.g. due to data privacy or intellectual property). In this paper, we address the challenging source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) problem, where the source pretrained model is adapted to the target domain in the absence of source data. Our method is based on the observation that target data, which might not align with the source domain classifier, still forms clear clusters. We capture this intrinsic structure by defining local affinity of the target data, and encourage label consistency among data with high local affinity. We observe that higher affinity should be assigned to reciprocal neighbors. To aggregate information with more context, we consider expanded neighborhoods with small affinity values. Furthermore, we consider the density around each target sample, which can alleviate the negative impact of potential outliers. In the experimental results we verify that the inherent structure of the target features is an important source of information for domain adaptation. We demonstrate that this local structure can be efficiently captured by considering the local neighbors, the reciprocal neighbors, and the expanded neighborhood. Finally, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on several 2D image and 3D point cloud recognition datasets."}

Quantization techniques, which reduce the bits needed for model weights or activations with minimal performance loss, have become popular due to the rise of LLMs. However, most quantization studies use pre-trained LLMs, and the impact of quantization on instruction-tuned LLMs and the relationship between perplexity and benchmark performance of quantized LLMs are not well understood. Evaluation of quantized LLMs is often limited to language modeling and a few classification tasks, leaving their performance on other benchmarks unclear. To address these gaps, we propose a structured evaluation framework consisting of three critical dimensions: (1) knowledge \\& capacity, (2) alignment, and (3) efficiency, and conduct extensive experiments across ten diverse benchmarks. Our experimental results indicate that LLMs with 4-bit quantization can retain performance comparable to their non-quantized counterparts, and perplexity can serve as a proxy metric for quantized LLMs on most benchmarks. Furthermore, quantized LLMs with larger parameter scales can outperform smaller LLMs. Despite the memory savings achieved through quantization, it can also slow down the inference speed of LLMs. Consequently, substantial engineering efforts and hardware support are imperative to achieve a balanced optimization of decoding speed and memory consumption in the context of quantized LLMs."}

The inflexibility of these methods can bring unnecessary computational overhead or sub-optimal performance. To address this limitation, we introduce an Adaptive-Solver (AS) framework tha dynamically adapts solving strategies to suit various problems, enabling the flexible allocation of test-time computational resources. The framework functions with two primary modules. The initial evaluation module assesses the reliability of the current solution using answer consistency. If the solution is deemed unreliable, the subsequent adaptation module comes into play. Within this module, various types of adaptation strategies are employed collaboratively. Through such dynamic and multi-faceted adaptations, our framework can help reduce computational consumption and improve performance. Experimental results from complex reasoning benchmarks reveal that our method can significantly reduce API costs (up to 85%) while maintaining original performance.

It can provide adaptation without a target label and support the case where a source dataset is constructed from multiple domains. However, it is impractical, wherein its training heavily relies on prior domain information of the multi-source dataset -- how many domains exist and the domain label of each data sample. Moreover, MSDA requires both source and target datasets simultaneously (physically), causing storage limitations on the client device or data privacy issues by transferring client data to a server. For a more practical scenario of model adaptation from a service provider's point of view, we relax these constraints and present a novel problem scenario of Three-Free Domain Adaptation, namely TFDA, where 1) target labels, 2) source dataset, and mostly 3) source domain information (domain labels + the number of domains) are unavailable. Under the problem scenario, we propose a practical adaptation framework called FREEDOM. It leverages the power of the generative model, disentangling data into class and style aspects, where the style is defined as the class-independent information from the source data and designed with a nonparametric Bayesian approach. In the adaptation stage, FREEDOM aims to match the source class distribution with the target's under the philosophy that class distribution is consistent even if the style is different; after then, only part of the classification model is deployed as a personalized network. As a result, FREEDOM achieves state-of-the-art or comparable performance even without domain information, with reduced final model size on the target side, independent of the number of source domains."}

Recent research on machine learning and fairness has emphasized that awareness of sensitive attributes, such as race and sex, is critical to the development of interventions. However, on the ground, the existence of these data cannot be taken for granted. This paper uses the domains of employment, credit, and healthcare in the United States to surface conditions that have shaped the availability of sensitive attribute data. For each domain, we describe how and when private companies collect or infer sensitive attribute data for antidiscrimination purposes. An inconsistent story emerges: Some companies are required by law to collect sensitive attribute data, while others are prohibited from doing so. Still others, in the absence of legal mandates, have determined that collection and imputation of these data are appropriate to address disparities. This story has important implications for fairness research and its future applications. If companies that mediate access to life opportunities are unable or hesitant to collect or infer sensitive attribute data, then proposed techniques to detect and mitigate bias in machine learning models might never be implemented outside the lab. We conclude that today's legal requirements and corporate practices, while highly inconsistent across domains, offer lessons for how to approach the collection and inference of sensitive data in appropriate circumstances. We urge stakeholders, including machine learning practitioners, to actively help chart a path forward that takes both policy goals and technical needs into account."}

Through this paper, we consider calls to collect more data on demographics to enable algorithmic fairness and challenge the notion that discrimination can be overcome with smart enough technical methods and sufficient data alone. We show how these techniques largely ignore broader questions of data governance and systemic oppression when categorizing individuals for the purpose of fairer algorithmic processing. In this work, we explore under what conditions demographic data should be collected and used to enable algorithmic fairness methods by characterizing a range of social risks to individuals and communities. For the risks to individuals we consider the unique privacy risks associated with the sharing of sensitive attributes likely to be the target of fairness analysis, the possible harms stemming from miscategorizing and misrepresenting individuals in the data collection process, and the use of sensitive data beyond data subjects' expectations. Looking more broadly, the risks to entire groups and communities include the expansion of surveillance infrastructure in the name of fairness, misrepresenting and mischaracterizing what it means to be part of a demographic group or to hold a certain identity, and ceding the ability to define for themselves what constitutes biased or unfair treatment. We argue that, by confronting these questions before and during the collection of demographic data, algorithmic fairness methods are more likely to actually mitigate harmful treatment disparities without reinforcing systems of oppression."}

This perspective, however, tends to overlook the vital role of LLMs as user-centric services in human-AI collaboration. This gap in research becomes increasingly critical as LLMs become more integrated into people's everyday and professional interactions. This study addresses the important need to understand user satisfaction with LLMs by exploring four key aspects: comprehending user intents, scrutinizing user experiences, addressing major user concerns about current LLM services, and charting future research paths to bolster human-AI collaborations. Our study develops a taxonomy of 7 user intents in LLM interactions, grounded in analysis of real-world user interaction logs and human verification. Subsequently, we conduct a user survey to gauge their satisfaction with LLM services, encompassing usage frequency, experiences across intents, and predominant concerns. This survey, compiling 411 anonymous responses, uncovers 11 first-hand insights into the current state of user engagement with LLMs. Based on this empirical analysis, we pinpoint 6 future research directions prioritizing the user perspective in LLM developments. This user-centered approach is essential for crafting LLMs that are not just technologically advanced but also resonate with the intricate realities of human interactions and real-world applications."}

However, crowdsourcing, an important, inexpensive way to obtain human annotations, may itself be impacted by LLMs, as crowd workers have financial incentives to use LLMs to increase their productivity and income. To investigate this concern, we conducted a case study on the prevalence of LLM usage by crowd workers. We reran an abstract summarization task from the literature on Amazon Mechanical Turk and, through a combination of keystroke detection and synthetic text classification, estimate that 33-46% of crowd workers used LLMs when completing the task. Although generalization to other, less LLM-friendly tasks is unclear, our results call for platforms, researchers, and crowd workers to find new ways to ensure that human data remain human, perhaps using the methodology proposed here as a stepping stone.

Their potential for deeper user understanding and improved personalized user experience on recommendation platforms is, however, largely untapped. This paper aims to address this gap. Recommender systems today capture users' interests through encoding their historical activities on the platforms. The generated user representations are hard to examine or interpret. On the other hand, if we were to ask people about interests they pursue in their life, they might talk about their hobbies, like I just started learning the ukulele, or their relaxation routines, e.g., I like to watch Saturday Night Live, or I want to plant a vertical garden. We argue, and demonstrate through extensive experiments, that LLMs as foundation models can reason through user activities, and describe their interests in nuanced and interesting ways, similar to how a human would. We define interest journeys as the persistent and overarching user interests, in other words, the non-transient ones. These are the interests that we believe will benefit most from the nuanced and personalized descriptions. We introduce a framework in which we first perform personalized extraction of interest journeys, and then summarize the extracted journeys via LLMs, using techniques like few-shot prompting, prompt-tuning and fine-tuning. Together, our results in prompting LLMs to name extracted user journeys in a large-scale industrial platform demonstrate great potential of these models in providing deeper, more interpretable, and controllable user understanding. We believe LLM powered user understanding can be a stepping stone to entirely new user experiences on recommendation platforms that are journey-aware, assistive, and enabling frictionless conversation down the line."}

Their truthfulness and factuality are thus of great interest. To help users make the right decisions about the information they get, LLMs should not only provide information but also help users fact-check it. Our experiments with 80 crowdworkers compare language models with search engines (information retrieval systems) at facilitating fact-checking. We prompt LLMs to validate a given claim and provide corresponding explanations. Users reading LLM explanations are significantly more efficient than those using search engines while achieving similar accuracy. However, they over-rely on the LLMs when the explanation is wrong. To reduce over-reliance on LLMs, we ask LLMs to provide contrastive information - explain both why the claim is true and false, and then we present both sides of the explanation to users. This contrastive explanation mitigates users' over-reliance on LLMs, but cannot significantly outperform search engines. Further, showing both search engine results and LLM explanations offers no complementary benefits compared to search engines alone. Taken together, our study highlights that natural language explanations by LLMs may not be a reliable replacement for reading the retrieved passages, especially in high-stakes settings where over-relying on wrong AI explanations could lead to critical consequences."}

However, the attitudinal disparities between LLMs and humans towards these goals can pose significant challenges. This study conducts a comprehensive review and analysis of the existing literature on the attitudes of LLMs towards the 17 SDGs, emphasizing the comparison between their attitudes and support for each goal and those of humans. We examine the potential disparities, primarily focusing on aspects such as understanding and emotions, cultural and regional differences, task objective variations, and factors considered in the decision-making process. These disparities arise from the underrepresentation and imbalance in LLM training data, historical biases, quality issues, lack of contextual understanding, and skewed ethical values reflected. The study also investigates the risks and harms that may arise from neglecting the attitudes of LLMs towards the SDGs, including the exacerbation of social inequalities, racial discrimination, environmental destruction, and resource wastage. To address these challenges, we propose strategies and recommendations to guide and regulate the application of LLMs, ensuring their alignment with the principles and goals of the SDGs, and therefore creating a more just, inclusive, and sustainable future."}

Secondly, we conduct a comparison between the previous PLMs and the latest LLMs, as well as comparing various LLMs with each other.

Finally, the unique concerns associated with deploying LLMs in Healthcare settings are investigated, particularly regarding fairness, accountability, transparency and ethics. Our survey provide a comprehensive investigation from perspectives of both computer science and Healthcare specialty. Besides the discussion about Healthcare concerns, we supports the computer science community by compiling a collection of open source resources, such as accessible datasets, the latest methodologies, code implementations, and evaluation benchmarks in the Github.

However, introducing and using LLMs comes with biases and discrimination, resulting in concerns about equality, diversity and fairness, and must be addressed. While understanding and acknowledging bias in LLMs and developing mitigation strategies are crucial, the generalised assumptions towards societal needs can result in disadvantages towards under-represented societies and indigenous populations. Furthermore, the ongoing changes to actual and proposed amendments to regulations and laws worldwide also impact research capabilities in tackling the bias problem. This research presents a comprehensive survey synthesising the current trends and limitations in techniques used for identifying and mitigating bias in LLMs, where the overview of methods for tackling bias are grouped into metrics, benchmark datasets, and mitigation strategies. The importance and novelty of this survey are that it explores the perspective of under-represented societies. We argue that current practices tackling the bias problem cannot simply be 'plugged in' to address the needs of under-represented societies. We use examples from New Zealand to present requirements for adopting existing techniques to under-represented societies."}

Our experience underscores the importance of using diverse assessment methodologies and involving raters of varying backgrounds and expertise.

We identify and curate a list of 220 principles from literature, and derive a set of 37 core principles organized into seven categories: assumptions and perspectives, reasoning, information and evidence, robustness and security, ethics, utility, and implications. We conduct a small-scale expert survey, eliciting the subjective importance experts assign to different principles and lay out avenues for future work beyond our preliminary results.

We discover that LLMs learn linear representations of space and time across multiple scales. These representations are robust to prompting variations and unified across different entity types (e.g. cities and landmarks). In addition, we identify individual \"space neurons\" and \"time neurons\" that reliably encode spatial and temporal coordinates.

From a theoretical perspective, universal approximability of Transformer-based models is also recently proved. However, the above understanding and analysis of self-attention is based on a pre-trained model. To rethink the importance analysis in self-attention, we study the significance of different positions in attention matrix during pre-training. A surprising result is that diagonal elements in the attention map are the least important compared with other attention positions. We provide a proof showing that these diagonal elements can indeed be removed without deteriorating model performance. Furthermore, we propose a Differentiable Attention Mask (DAM) algorithm, which further guides the design of the SparseBERT.

First, exemplar pools are created to represent the types of contexts where each LM provides a more reliable answer, leveraging a sentence embedding fine-tuned so that context similarity is close to dialogue state similarity. Then, during inference, the k-nearest exemplars to the testing instance are retrieved, and the instance is routed according to majority vote.

Inspired by the outstanding performance of large language models (LLMs) in computer vision and natural language processing, this paper aims to discuss the potential of large time series models in load forecasting with scarce historical data. Specifically, the large time series model is constructed as a time series generative pre-trained transformer (TimeGPT), which is trained on massive and diverse time series datasets consisting of 100 billion data points (e.g., finance, transportation, banking, web traffic, weather, energy, healthcare, etc.). Then, the scarce historical load data is used to fine-tune the TimeGPT, which helps it to adapt to the data distribution and characteristics associated with load forecasting. Simulation results show that TimeGPT outperforms the benchmarks (e.g., popular machine learning models and statistical models) for load forecasting on several real datasets with scarce training samples, particularly for short look-ahead times. However, it cannot be guaranteed that TimeGPT is always superior to benchmarks for load forecasting with scarce data, since the performance of TimeGPT may be affected by the distribution differences between the load data and the training data. In practical applications, we can divide the historical data into a training set and a validation set, and then use the validation set loss to decide whether TimeGPT is the best choice for a specific dataset."}

However, these models are extremely computationally expensive, even at inference time, raising the natural question: when is the extra cost of deploying a larger model worth the anticipated boost in capabilities? Better understanding this tradeoff fundamentally could benefit from an inference efficiency metric that is both (i) easily comparable across models from different providers, and (ii) representative of the true cost of running queries in an isolated performance environment. Unfortunately, access to LLMs today is largely restricted to black-box text generation APIs and raw runtimes measured through this interface do not satisfy these desiderata: model providers can apply various software and hardware optimizations orthogonal to the model, and models served on shared infrastructure are susceptible to performance contention. To circumvent these problems, we propose a new metric for comparing inference efficiency across models. This metric puts models on equal footing as though they were served (i) on uniform hardware and software, and (ii) without performance contention. We call this metric the \\emph{idealized runtime}, and we propose a methodology to efficiently estimate this metric for autoregressive Transformer models. We also propose cost-aware variants that incorporate the number of accelerators needed to serve the model. Using these metrics, we compare ten state-of-the-art LLMs to provide the first analysis of inference efficiency-capability tradeoffs; we make several observations from this analysis, including the fact that the superior inference runtime performance of certain APIs is often a byproduct of optimizations within the API rather than the underlying model.

This paper provides the first comprehensive research agenda of the LLM supply chain, offering a structured approach to identify critical challenges and opportunities through the dual lenses of software engineering (SE) and security & privacy (S\\&P). We begin by establishing a clear definition of the LLM supply chain, encompassing its components and dependencies. We then analyze each layer of the supply chain, presenting a vision for robust and secure LLM development, reviewing the current state of practices and technologies, and identifying key challenges and research opportunities. This work aims to bridge the existing research gap in systematically understanding the multifaceted issues within the LLM supply chain, offering valuable insights to guide future efforts in this rapidly evolving domain."}

To help rectify these issues, we introduce System 2 Attention (S2A), which leverages the ability of LLMs to reason in natural language and follow instructions in order to decide what to attend to. S2A regenerates the input context to only include the relevant portions, before attending to the regenerated context to elicit the final response. In experiments, S2A outperforms standard attention-based LLMs on three tasks containing opinion or irrelevant information, QA, math word problems and longform generation, where S2A increases factuality and objectivity, and decreases sycophancy."}

A notable approach in this realm is the State-Space Machines (SSMs) architecture, which showed on-par performance on language modeling tasks with the self-attention transformers. However, such an architectural change requires a full pretraining of the weights from scratch, which incurs a huge cost to researchers and practitioners who want to use the new architectures. In the more traditional linear attention works, it has been proposed to approximate full attention with linear attention by swap-and-finetune framework. Motivated by this approach, we propose Cross-Architecture Transfer Learning (XATL), in which the weights of the shared components between LCI and self-attention-based transformers, such as layernorms, MLPs, input/output embeddings, are directly transferred to the new architecture from already pre-trained model parameters. We experimented the efficacy of the method on varying sizes and alternative attention architectures and show that \\methodabbr significantly reduces the training time up to 2.5x times and converges to a better minimum with up to 2.6% stronger model on the LM benchmarks within the same compute budget."}

Human-driven system configuration and management are proving unsatisfactory due to the recent interest in time-sensitive applications with stringent quality of service (QoS). Aiming to transition from the traditional human-driven to zero-touch service management in the field of networks and computing, intent-driven service management (IDSM) has been proposed as a response to stringent quality of service requirements. In IDSM, users express their service requirements in a declarative manner as intents. IDSM, with the help of closed control-loop operations, perform configurations and deployments, autonomously to meet service request requirements. The result is a faster deployment of Internet services and reduction in configuration errors caused by manual operations, which in turn reduces the service-level agreement (SLA) violations. In the early stages of development, IDSM systems require attention from industry as well as academia. In an attempt to fill the gaps in current research, we conducted a systematic literature review of SLA management in IDSM systems. As an outcome, we have identified four IDSM intent management activities and proposed a taxonomy for each activity. Analysis of all studies and future research directions, are presented in the conclusions."}

The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has revolutionized conversational agents, employing advanced deep learning techniques to generate context-aware, coherent, and personalized responses. Consequently, LLM-based AI assistants provide a more natural and efficient user experience across various scenarios. In this paper, we study how LLM models can be used to improve work efficiency in collaborative workplaces. Specifically, we present an LLM-based Smart Reply (LSR) system utilizing the ChatGPT to generate personalized responses in professional collaborative scenarios while adapting to context and communication style based on prior responses. Our two-step process involves generating a preliminary response type (e.g., Agree, Disagree) to provide a generalized direction for message generation, thus reducing response drafting time. We conducted an experiment where participants completed simulated work tasks involving a Dual N-back test and subtask scheduling through Google Calendar while interacting with co-workers. Our findings indicate that the proposed LSR reduces overall workload, as measured by the NASA TLX, and improves work performance and productivity in the N-back task. We also provide qualitative analysis based on participants' experiences, as well as design considerations to provide future directions for improving such implementations."}

Among the leading innovations of 6G is the concept of Zero Touch Networks (ZTNs), aiming to achieve fully automated, self-optimizing networks with minimal human intervention. Despite the advantages ZTNs offer in terms of efficiency and scalability, challenges surrounding transparency, adaptability, and human trust remain prevalent. Concurrently, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents an opportunity to elevate the ZTN framework by bridging the gap between automated processes and human-centric interfaces. This paper explores the integration of LLMs into ZTNs, highlighting their potential to enhance network transparency and improve user interactions. Through a comprehensive case study on deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based anti-jamming technique, we demonstrate how LLMs can distill intricate network operations into intuitive, human-readable reports. Additionally, we address the technical and ethical intricacies of melding LLMs with ZTNs, with an emphasis on data privacy, transparency, and bias reduction. Looking ahead, we identify emerging research avenues at the nexus of LLMs and ZTNs, advocating for sustained innovation and interdisciplinary synergy in the domain of automated networks."}

The personalization of LLMs could further contribute to their applications due to better alignment with human intents. Towards personalized generative services, a collaborative cloud-edge methodology is promising, as it facilitates the effective orchestration of heterogeneous distributed communication and computing resources. In this article, we put forward NetGPT to capably synergize appropriate LLMs at the edge and the cloud based on their computing capacity. In addition, edge LLMs could efficiently leverage location-based information for personalized prompt completion, thus benefiting the interaction with the cloud LLM. In particular, we present the feasibility of NetGPT by leveraging low-rank adaptation-based fine-tuning of open-source LLMs (i.e., GPT-2-base model and LLaMA model), and conduct comprehensive numerical comparisons with alternative cloud-edge collaboration or cloud-only techniques, so as to demonstrate the superiority of NetGPT. Subsequently, we highlight the essential changes required for an artificial intelligence (AI)-native network architecture towards NetGPT, with emphasis on deeper integration of communications and computing resources and careful calibration of logical AI workflow. Furthermore, we demonstrate several benefits of NetGPT, which come as by-products, as the edge LLMs' capability to predict trends and infer intents promises a unified solution for intelligent network management & orchestration. We argue that NetGPT is a promising AI-native network architecture for provisioning beyond personalized generative services."}

A recent approach for finding a common representation of the two domains is via domain adversarial training (Ganin & Lempitsky, 2015), which attempts to induce a feature extractor that matches the source and target feature distributions in some feature space. However, domain adversarial training faces two critical limitations: 1) if the feature extraction function has high-capacity, then feature distribution matching is a weak constraint, 2) in non-conservative domain adaptation (where no single classifier can perform well in both the source and target domains), training the model to do well on the source domain hurts performance on the target domain. In this paper, we address these issues through the lens of the cluster assumption, i.e., decision boundaries should not cross high-density data regions. We propose two novel and related models: 1) the Virtual Adversarial Domain Adaptation (VADA) model, which combines domain adversarial training with a penalty term that punishes the violation the cluster assumption; 2) the Decision-boundary Iterative Refinement Training with a Teacher (DIRT-T) model, which takes the VADA model as initialization and employs natural gradient steps to further minimize the cluster assumption violation. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that the combination of these two models significantly improve the state-of-the-art performance on the digit, traffic sign, and Wi-Fi recognition domain adaptation benchmarks."}

The research is based on an analysis of the societal impacts observed in a set of six case studies across different European sectors. These impacts are divided into economic, social and ethical, legal and political impacts, and affect areas such as improved efficiency, innovation and decision making, changing business models, dependency on public funding, participation, equality, discrimination and trust, data protection and intellectual property rights, private and public tensions and losing control to actors abroad. A special focus is given to the risks and opportunities coming from the legal framework and how to counter the negative impacts of big data. Recommendations are presented for four specific legal frameworks: copyright and database protection, protection of trade secrets, privacy and data protection and anti-discrimination. In addition, the potential social benefits of big data are exemplified in six domains: improved decision making and event detection; data-driven innovations and new business models; direct social, environmental and other citizen benefits; citizen participation, transparency and public trust; privacy-aware data practices; and big data for identifying discrimination. Several best practices are suggested to capture these benefits."}

The prevailing discourse in classification often emphasizes outcome-based metrics comparing sensitive subgroups without a nuanced consideration of the differential impacts within subgroups. Bias mitigation techniques not only affect the ranking of pairs of instances across sensitive groups, but often also significantly affect the ranking of instances within these groups. Such changes are hard to explain and raise concerns regarding the validity of the intervention. Unfortunately, these effects remain under the radar in the accuracy-fairness evaluation framework that is usually applied. Additionally, we illustrate the effect of several popular bias mitigation methods, and how their output often does not reflect real-world scenarios."}

This study investigates the usage of LLMs among 1,500 representative US citizens. Remarkably, 42% of participants reported utilizing an LLM. Our findings reveal a gender gap in LLM technology adoption (more male users than female users) with complex interaction patterns regarding age. Technology-related education eliminates the gender gap in our sample. Moreover, expert users are more likely than novices to list professional tasks as typical application scenarios, suggesting discrepancies in effective usage at the workplace. These results underscore the importance of providing education in artificial intelligence in our technology-driven society to promote equitable access to and benefits from LLMs. We urge for both international replication beyond the US and longitudinal observation of adoption."}

On a text summarization task where workers were not directed in any way regarding their LLM use, the estimated prevalence of LLM use was around 30%, but was reduced by about half by asking workers to not use LLMs and by raising the cost of using them, e.g., by disabling copy-pasting. Secondary analyses give further insight into LLM use and its prevention: LLM use yields high-quality but homogeneous responses, which may harm research concerned with human (rather than model) behavior and degrade future models trained with crowdsourced data. At the same time, preventing LLM use may be at odds with obtaining high-quality responses; e.g., when requesting workers not to use LLMs, summaries contained fewer keywords carrying essential information. Our estimates will likely change as LLMs increase in popularity or capabilities, and as norms around their usage change. Yet, understanding the co-evolution of LLM-based tools and users is key to maintaining the validity of research done using crowdsourcing, and we provide a critical baseline before widespread adoption ensues."}

Here, we investigate the structure of LLM capabilities by extracting latent capabilities from patterns of individual differences across a varied population of LLMs. Using a combination of Bayesian and frequentist factor analysis, we analyzed data from 29 different LLMs across 27 cognitive tasks. We found evidence that LLM capabilities are not monolithic. Instead, they are better explained by three well-delineated factors that represent reasoning, comprehension and core language modeling. Moreover, we found that these three factors can explain a high proportion of the variance in model performance. These results reveal a consistent structure in the capabilities of different LLMs and demonstrate the multifaceted nature of these capabilities. We also found that the three abilities show different relationships to model properties such as model size and instruction tuning. These patterns help refine our understanding of scaling laws and indicate that changes to a model that improve one ability might simultaneously impair others. Based on these findings, we suggest that benchmarks could be streamlined by focusing on tasks that tap into each broad model ability."}

This has sparked concerns about aligning these models with human values, their impact on labor markets, and the potential need for regulation in further research and development. However, the discourse often lacks a focus on the imperative to widely diffuse the societal benefits of LLMs. To qualify this societal benefit, we assert that LLMs exhibit emergent abilities to humanize technology more effectively than previous technologies, and for people across language, occupation, and accessibility divides. We argue that they do so by addressing three mechanizing bottlenecks in today's computing technologies: creating diverse and accessible content, learning complex digital tools, and personalizing machine learning algorithms. We adopt a case-based approach and illustrate each bottleneck with two examples where current technology imposes bottlenecks that LLMs demonstrate the ability to address. Given this opportunity to humanize technology widely, we advocate for more widespread understanding of LLMs, tools and methods to simplify use of LLMs, and cross-cutting institutional capacity."}

In this work, we make a substantial step towards unveiling this underlying prediction process, by reverse-engineering the operation of the feed-forward network (FFN) layers, one of the building blocks of transformer models. We view the token representation as a changing distribution over the vocabulary, and the output from each FFN layer as an additive update to that distribution. Then, we analyze the FFN updates in the vocabulary space, showing that each update can be decomposed to sub-updates corresponding to single FFN parameter vectors, each promoting concepts that are often human-interpretable. We then leverage these findings for controlling LM predictions, where we reduce the toxicity of GPT2 by almost 50%, and for improving computation efficiency with a simple early exit rule, saving 20% of computation on average."}

In healthcare, there is a strong need for tools that may improve the routines of the clinicians and the patients. Naturally, the use of attention-based algorithms for medical applications occurred smoothly. However, being healthcare a domain that depends on high-stake decisions, the scientific community must ponder if these high-performing algorithms fit the needs of medical applications. With this motto, this paper extensively reviews the use of attention mechanisms in machine learning (including Transformers) for several medical applications. This work distinguishes itself from its predecessors by proposing a critical analysis of the claims and potentialities of attention mechanisms presented in the literature through an experimental case study on medical image classification with three different use cases. These experiments focus on the integrating process of attention mechanisms into established deep learning architectures, the analysis of their predictive power, and a visual assessment of their saliency maps generated by post-hoc explanation methods. This paper concludes with a critical analysis of the claims and potentialities presented in the literature about attention mechanisms and proposes future research lines in medical applications that may benefit from these frameworks."}

Questioning the Importance of Attention in Pretrained Transformers", "abstract": "The attention mechanism is considered the backbone of the widely-used Transformer architecture. It contextualizes the input by computing input-specific attention matrices. We find that this mechanism, while powerful and elegant, is not as important as typically thought for pretrained language models. We introduce PAPA, a new probing method that replaces the input-dependent attention matrices with constant ones -- the average attention weights over multiple inputs. We use PAPA to analyze several established pretrained Transformers on six downstream tasks. We find that without any input-dependent attention, all models achieve competitive performance -- an average relative drop of only 8% from the probing baseline. Further, little or no performance drop is observed when replacing half of the input-dependent attention matrices with constant (input-independent) ones. Interestingly, we show that better-performing models lose more from applying our method than weaker models, suggesting that the utilization of the input-dependent attention mechanism might be a factor in their success. Our results motivate research on simpler alternatives to input-dependent attention, as well as on methods for better utilization of this mechanism in the Transformer architecture."}

Service providers typically monitor SLAs for management tasks such as improving their service quality, customer billing and future network planning. Network service customers, on their side, monitor SLAs to optimize network usage and apply, when required, penalties related to service failures. In future 6G networks, critical network applications such as remote surgery and connected vehicles will require these SLAs to be more dynamic, flexible, and automated to match their diverse requirements on network services. Moreover, these SLAs should be transparent to all stakeholders to address the trustworthiness on network services and service providers required by critical applications. Currently, there is no standardised method to immutably record and audit SLAs, leading to challenges in aspects such as SLA enforcement and accountability -- traits essential for future network applications. This work explores new requirements for future service contracts, that is, on the evolution of SLAs. Based on those new requirements, we propose an end to end layered SLA architecture leveraging Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and smart contracts. Our architecture is inheritable by an existing telco-application layered architectural frameworks to support future SLAs. We also discuss some limitations of DLT and smart contracts and provide several directions of future studies."}

Such infrastructure faces a diverse range of challenges to its operations that include security, privacy, resilience, and quality of services. Among these, cybersecurity and privacy are taking the centre-stage, especially since the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. Traditional security and privacy techniques are overstretched and adversarial actors have evolved to design exploitation techniques that circumvent protection. With the ever-increasing complexity of technology infrastructure, security and privacy-preservation specialists have started to look for adaptable and flexible protection methods that can evolve (potentially autonomously) as the adversarial actor changes its techniques. For this, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) were put forward as saviours. In this paper, we look at the promises of AI, ML, and DL stated in academic and industrial literature and evaluate how realistic they are. We also put forward potential challenges a DL based security and privacy protection technique has to overcome.

However, the deployment of high-performance LLMs incurs substantial costs, primarily due to the increased number of parameters aimed at enhancing model performance. This has made the use of state-of-the-art LLMs more expensive for end-users. AI service providers, such as OpenAI and Anthropic, often offer multiple versions of LLMs with varying prices and performance. However, end-users still face challenges in choosing the appropriate LLM for their tasks that balance result quality with cost. We introduce SMART, Scaling Models Adaptively for Reduced Token Fees, a novel LLM framework designed to minimize the inference costs of NLP tasks while ensuring sufficient result quality. It enables users to specify an accuracy constraint in terms of the equivalence of outputs to those of the most powerful LLM. SMART then generates results that deviate from the outputs of this LLM only with a probability below a user-defined threshold. SMART employs a profiling phase that evaluates the performance of multiple LLMs to identify those that meet the user-defined accuracy level. SMART optimizes the tradeoff between profiling overheads and the anticipated cost savings resulting from profiling. Moreover, our approach significantly reduces inference costs by strategically leveraging a mix of LLMs. Our experiments on three real-world datasets show that, based on OpenAI models, SMART achieves significant cost savings, up to 25.6x in comparison to GPT-4."}

To facilitate the development of LLM agents, we present a novel paradigm of training LLM agents without modifying the LLM weights, which is particularly useful when the LLMs are difficult or inaccessible for modifications. Inspired by how humans continuously forge tools to adapt to real-world tasks, rather than change our biological structure to fit a static set of tools, we propose to progressively forge agent's functions to better solve the downstream tasks instead of modifying the LLM weights. By treating the functions as learnable `agent parameters' and leveraging the fundamental idea of model training in artificial intelligence, we develop AgentOptimizer that employs the LLM to update agents' functions and devise an agent training algorithm with two strategies, roll-back, and early-stop, to streamline the training process. With extensive experiments, we showcase that the agent training paradigm could significantly improve the performance of representative LLM agents in various downstream tasks. We also study the behavior of the agent training regarding aspects like the learning curve and domain transferability."}

{"id": "195", "arxiv": "1610.02527v1", "title": "Federated Optimization: Distributed Machine Learning for On-Device Intelligence", "abstract": "We introduce a new and increasingly relevant setting for distributed optimization in machine learning, where the data defining the optimization are unevenly distributed over an extremely large number of nodes. The goal is to train a high-quality centralized model. We refer to this setting as Federated Optimization. In this setting, communication efficiency is of the utmost importance and minimizing the number of rounds of communication is the principal goal. A motivating example arises when we keep the training data locally on users' mobile devices instead of logging it to a data center for training. In federated optimziation, the devices are used as compute nodes performing computation on their local data in order to update a global model. We suppose that we have extremely large number of devices in the network --- as many as the number of users of a given service, each of which has only a tiny fraction of the total data available. In particular, we expect the number of data points available locally to be much smaller than the number of devices. Additionally, since different users generate data with different patterns, it is reasonable to assume that no device has a representative sample of the overall distribution. We show that existing algorithms are not suitable for this setting, and propose a new algorithm which shows encouraging experimental results for sparse convex problems. This work also sets a path for future research needed in the context of \\federated optimization."}

The resource consumption of deep learning models in terms of amount of training data, compute and energy costs are known to be massive. These large resource costs can be barriers in deploying these models in clinics, globally. To address this, there are cogent efforts within the machine learning community to introduce notions of resource efficiency. For instance, using quantisation to alleviate memory consumption. While most of these methods are shown to reduce the resource utilisation, they could come at a cost in performance. In this work, we probe into the trade-off between resource consumption and performance, specifically, when dealing with models that are used in critical settings such as in clinics."}

This research constructs a model of costs facing propagandists for content generation at scale and analyzes (1) the potential savings that LLMs could offer propagandists, (2) the potential deterrent effect of monitoring controls on API-accessible LLMs, and (3) the optimal strategy for propagandists choosing between multiple private and/or open source LLMs when conducting influence operations. Primary results suggest that LLMs need only produce usable outputs with relatively low reliability (roughly 25%) to offer cost savings to propagandists, that the potential reduction in content generation costs can be quite high (up to 70% for a highly reliable model), and that monitoring capabilities have sharply limited cost imposition effects when alternative open source models are available. In addition, these results suggest that nation-states -- even those conducting many large-scale influence operations per year -- are unlikely to benefit economically from training custom LLMs specifically for use in influence operations."}

Correspondingly, significant resources are allocated towards research that aims to further advance this technology, typically resulting in models of increasing size that are trained on increasing amounts of data. This work, however, demonstrates the surprising result that it is often possible to significantly improve the performance of LLMs by selectively removing higher-order components of their weight matrices. This simple intervention, which we call LAyer-SElective Rank reduction (LASER), can be done on a model after training has completed, and requires no additional parameters or data. We show extensive experiments demonstrating the generality of this finding across language models and datasets, and provide in-depth analyses offering insights into both when LASER is effective and the mechanism by which it operates."}

At the same time, it has been repeatedly shown that LLMs lack systematic generalization, which allows to extrapolate the learned statistical regularities outside the training distribution. In this work, we offer a systematic benchmarking of GPT-4, one of the most advanced LLMs available, on three algorithmic tasks characterized by the possibility to control the problem difficulty with two parameters. We compare the performance of GPT-4 with that of its predecessor (GPT-3.5) and with a variant of the Transformer-Encoder architecture recently introduced to solve similar tasks, the Neural Data Router. We find that the deployment of advanced prompting techniques allows GPT-4 to reach superior accuracy on all tasks, demonstrating that state-of-the-art LLMs constitute a very strong baseline also in challenging tasks that require systematic generalization."}

However, these models often experience overfitting due to data redundancy in rolling forecasting settings, limiting their generalization ability particularly evident in longer sequences with highly similar adjacent data. In this work, we introduce CLMFormer, a novel framework that mitigates redundancy through curriculum learning and a memory-driven decoder. Specifically, we progressively introduce Bernoulli noise to the training samples, which effectively breaks the high similarity between adjacent data points. This curriculum-driven noise introduction aids the memory-driven decoder by supplying more diverse and representative training data, enhancing the decoder's ability to model seasonal tendencies and dependencies in the time-series data. To further enhance forecasting accuracy, we introduce a memory-driven decoder. This component enables the model to capture seasonal tendencies and dependencies in the time-series data and leverages temporal relationships to facilitate the forecasting process. Extensive experiments on six real-world LTSF benchmarks show that CLMFormer consistently improves Transformer-based models by up to 30%, demonstrating its effectiveness in long-horizon forecasting."}

Transformer architecture's core mechanism -- attention requires $O(n^2)$ time complexity in training and $O(n)$ time complexity in inference. Many works have been proposed to improve the attention mechanism's scalability, such as Flash Attention and Multi-query Attention. A different line of work aims to design new mechanisms to replace attention. Recently, a notable model structure -- Mamba, which is based on state space models, has achieved transformer-equivalent performance in multiple sequence modeling tasks. In this work, we examine \\mamba's efficacy through the lens of a classical IR task -- document ranking. A reranker model takes a query and a document as input, and predicts a scalar relevance score. This task demands the language model's ability to comprehend lengthy contextual inputs and to capture the interaction between query and document tokens. We find that (1) Mamba models achieve competitive performance compared to transformer-based models with the same training recipe; (2) but also have a lower training throughput in comparison to efficient transformer implementations such as flash attention. We hope this study can serve as a starting point to explore Mamba models in other classical IR tasks. Our code implementation and trained checkpoints are made public to facilitate reproducibility (https://github.com/zhichaoxu-shufe/RankMamba)."}

The crucial computational mechanism underlying their performance relies on transforming a complete input sequence - for example, all the words in a sentence - into a long \"encoding vector\" that allows transformers to learn long-range temporal dependencies in naturalistic sequences. Specifically, \"self-attention\" applied to this encoding vector enhances temporal context in transformers by computing associations between pairs of words in the input sequence. We suggest that waves of neural activity traveling across single cortical areas or multiple regions at the whole-brain scale could implement a similar encoding principle. By encapsulating recent input history into a single spatial pattern at each moment in time, cortical waves may enable temporal context to be extracted from sequences of sensory inputs, the same computational principle used in transformers."}

By forming teams of simulated personae, supplying contexts that set the stage, and providing gentle prompts, one can move through scenarios that elicit expert behavior to perform meaningful cognitive work. The power of this strategy is demonstrated with two examples, one attacking factuality of LLM responses and the other reproducing a very recently published result in quantum optics."}

Recent work has leveraged LLM's ability to generate abstract plans to simplify challenging control tasks, either by action scoring, or action modeling (fine-tuning). However, the transformer architecture inherits several constraints that make it difficult for the LLM to directly serve as the agent: e.g. limited input lengths, fine-tuning inefficiency, bias from pre-training, and incompatibility with non-text environments. To maintain compatibility with a low-level trainable actor, we propose to instead use the knowledge in LLMs to simplify the control problem, rather than solving it. We propose the Plan, Eliminate, and Track (PET) framework. The Plan module translates a task description into a list of high-level sub-tasks. The Eliminate module masks out irrelevant objects and receptacles from the observation for the current sub-task. Finally, the Track module determines whether the agent has accomplished each sub-task. On the AlfWorld instruction following benchmark, the PET framework leads to a significant 15% improvement over SOTA for generalization to human goal specifications."}

However, alongside these advancements, they have also introduced potential threats. One critical concern is the misuse of LLMs by disinformation spreaders, leveraging these models to generate highly persuasive yet misleading content that challenges the disinformation detection system. This work aims to address this issue by answering three research questions: (1) To what extent can the current disinformation detection technique reliably detect LLM-generated disinformation? (2) If traditional techniques prove less effective, can LLMs themself be exploited to serve as a robust defense against advanced disinformation? and, (3) Should both these strategies falter, what novel approaches can be proposed to counter this burgeoning threat effectively? A holistic exploration for the formation and detection of disinformation is conducted to foster this line of research."}

These state-of-the-art tools can streamline complex processes. As a result, it reshapes the role of data scientists. We argue that LLMs are transforming the responsibilities of data scientists, shifting their focus from hands-on coding, data-wrangling and conducting standard analyses to assessing and managing analyses performed by these automated AIs. This evolution of roles is reminiscent of the transition from a software engineer to a product manager. We illustrate this transition with concrete data science case studies using LLMs in this paper. These developments necessitate a meaningful evolution in data science education. Pedagogy must now place greater emphasis on cultivating diverse skillsets among students, such as LLM-informed creativity, critical thinking, AI-guided programming. LLMs can also play a significant role in the classroom as interactive teaching and learning tools, contributing to personalized education. This paper discusses the opportunities, resources and open challenges for each of these directions. As with any transformative technology, integrating LLMs into education calls for careful consideration. While LLMs can perform repetitive tasks efficiently, it's crucial to remember that their role is to supplement human intelligence and creativity, not to replace it. Therefore, the new era of data science education should balance the benefits of LLMs while fostering complementary human expertise and innovations. In conclusion, the rise of LLMs heralds a transformative period for data science and its education. This paper seeks to shed light on the emerging trends, potential opportunities, and challenges accompanying this paradigm shift, hoping to spark further discourse and investigation into this exciting, uncharted territory."}

Understanding all the different fields of cybersecurity, which includes topics such as cryptography, reverse engineering, and risk assessment, poses a challenge even for human experts. To accurately test the general knowledge of LLMs in cybersecurity, the research community needs a diverse, accurate, and up-to-date dataset. To address this gap, we present CyberMetric-80, CyberMetric-500, CyberMetric-2000, and CyberMetric-10000, which are multiple-choice Q&A benchmark datasets comprising 80, 500, 2000, and 10,000 questions respectively. By utilizing GPT-3.5 and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we collected documents, including NIST standards, research papers, publicly accessible books, RFCs, and other publications in the cybersecurity domain, to generate questions, each with four possible answers. The results underwent several rounds of error checking and refinement. Human experts invested over 200 hours validating the questions and solutions to ensure their accuracy and relevance, and to filter out any questions unrelated to cybersecurity. We have evaluated and compared 25 state-of-the-art LLM models on the CyberMetric datasets. In addition to our primary goal of evaluating LLMs, we involved 30 human participants to solve CyberMetric-80 in a closed-book scenario. The results can serve as a reference for comparing the general cybersecurity knowledge of humans and LLMs. The findings revealed that GPT-4o, GPT-4-turbo, Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct, Falcon-180B-Chat, and GEMINI-pro 1.0 were the best-performing LLMs. Additionally, the top LLMs were more accurate than humans on CyberMetric-80, although highly experienced human experts still outperformed small models such as Llama-3-8B, Phi-2 or Gemma-7b."}
