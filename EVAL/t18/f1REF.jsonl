The evolution from language chat models to functional language agents demands that models not only master human interaction, reasoning, and planning but also ensure grounding in the relevant environments. This calls for a harmonious blend of language and coding capabilities in the models. Lemur and Lemur-Chat are proposed to address this necessity, demonstrating balanced proficiencies in both domains, unlike existing open-source models that tend to specialize in either. Through meticulous pre-training using a code-intensive corpus and instruction fine-tuning on text and code data, our models achieve state-of-the-art averaged performance across diverse text and coding benchmarks among open-source models. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate Lemur's superiority over existing open-source models and its proficiency across various agent tasks involving human communication, tool usage, and interaction under fully- and partially- observable environments. The harmonization between natural and programming languages enables Lemur-Chat to significantly narrow the gap with proprietary models on agent abilities, providing key insights into developing advanced open-source agents adept at reasoning, planning, and operating seamlessly across environments. https://github.com/OpenLemur/Lemur"}

Increasingly, code LLMs are being integrated into software development environments to improve the productivity of human programmers, and LLM-based agents are beginning to show promise for handling complex tasks autonomously. Realizing the full potential of code LLMs requires a wide range of capabilities, including code generation, fixing bugs, explaining and documenting code, maintaining repositories, and more. In this work, we introduce the Granite series of decoder-only code models for code generative tasks, trained with code written in 116 programming languages. The Granite Code models family consists of models ranging in size from 3 to 34 billion parameters, suitable for applications ranging from complex application modernization tasks to on-device memory-constrained use cases. Evaluation on a comprehensive set of tasks demonstrates that Granite Code models consistently reaches state-of-the-art performance among available open-source code LLMs. The Granite Code model family was optimized for enterprise software development workflows and performs well across a range of coding tasks (e.g. code generation, fixing and explanation), making it a versatile all around code model.

In the area of code synthesis, the commonly used evaluation metric is BLEU or perfect accuracy, but they are not suitable enough to evaluate codes, because BLEU is originally designed to evaluate the natural language, neglecting important syntactic and semantic features of codes, and perfect accuracy is too strict thus it underestimates different outputs with the same semantic logic. To remedy this, we introduce a new automatic evaluation metric, dubbed CodeBLEU. It absorbs the strength of BLEU in the n-gram match and further injects code syntax via abstract syntax trees (AST) and code semantics via data-flow. We conduct experiments by evaluating the correlation coefficient between CodeBLEU and quality scores assigned by the programmers on three code synthesis tasks, i.e., text-to-code, code translation, and code refinement. Experimental results show that our proposed CodeBLEU can achieve a better correlation with programmer assigned scores compared with BLEU and accuracy."}

High-quality software requirements not only enhance the manual software development process but also position organizations to fully harness the potential of the emerging LLMs technology.

This LLM is augmented with knowledge, heuristics, and instructions that are pertinent to the software development process, requirements analysis, object-oriented design, and test-driven development, effectively emulating the expertise of a seasoned software engineer. We introduce a \"Progressive Prompting\" method that allows software engineers to engage with this LLM in a stepwise manner. Through this approach, the LLM incrementally tackles software development tasks by interpreting the provided requirements to extract functional requirements, using these to create object-oriented models, and subsequently generating unit tests and code based on the object-oriented designs. We demonstrate the LLM's proficiency in comprehending intricate user requirements and producing robust design and code solutions through a case study focused on the development of a web project.

However, LLMs are prone to generate hallucinations, i.e., they generate text which sounds plausible but is incorrect. Although there has been a recent surge in research on LLM hallucinations for text generation, similar hallucination phenomenon can happen in code generation. Sometimes the generated code can have syntactical or logical errors as well as more advanced issues like security vulnerabilities, memory leaks, etc. Given the wide adaptation of LLMs to enhance efficiency in code generation and development in general, it becomes imperative to investigate hallucinations in code generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at studying hallucinations in the code generated by LLMs. We start by introducing the code hallucination definition and a comprehensive taxonomy of code hallucination types. We propose the first benchmark CodeMirage dataset for code hallucinations. The benchmark contains 1,137 GPT-3.5 generated hallucinated code snippets for Python programming problems from two base datasets - HumanEval and MBPP. We then propose the methodology for code hallucination detection and experiment with open source LLMs such as CodeLLaMA as well as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models using one-shot prompt. We find that GPT-4 performs the best on HumanEval dataset and gives comparable results to the fine-tuned CodeBERT baseline on MBPP dataset.

Source code summarization is one of the components for automatic document generation, which generates a summary in natural language from given source code. This suggests that techniques used in neural machine translation, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), can be used for source code summarization. However, there is a considerable difference between source code and natural language: Source code is essentially {\\em structured}, having loops and conditional branching, etc. Therefore, there is some obstacle to apply known machine translation models to source code. Abstract syntax trees (ASTs) capture these structural properties and play an important role in recent machine learning studies on source code. Tree-LSTM is proposed as a generalization of LSTMs for tree-structured data. However, there is a critical issue when applying it to ASTs: It cannot handle a tree that contains nodes having an arbitrary number of children and their order simultaneously, which ASTs generally have such nodes. To address this issue, we propose an extension of Tree-LSTM, which we call \\emph{Multi-way Tree-LSTM} and apply it for source code summarization.

However, state-of-the-art large language models generate codes in a single pass, without intermediate warm-ups to reflect the structured thought process of \"outline-then-detail\". Inspired by the recent success of chain-of-thought prompting, we propose ChainCoder, a program synthesis language model that generates Python code progressively, i.e. from coarse to fine in multiple passes. We first decompose source code into layout frame components and accessory components via abstract syntax tree parsing to construct a hierarchical representation. We then reform our prediction target into a multi-pass objective, each pass generates a subsequence, which is concatenated in the hierarchy. Finally, a tailored transformer architecture is leveraged to jointly encode the natural language descriptions and syntactically aligned I/O data samples.

To address this, we introduce Plot2Code, a comprehensive visual coding benchmark designed for a fair and in-depth assessment of MLLMs. We carefully collect 132 manually selected high-quality matplotlib plots across six plot types from publicly available matplotlib galleries. For each plot, we carefully offer its source code, and an descriptive instruction summarized by GPT-4. This approach enables Plot2Code to extensively evaluate MLLMs' code capabilities across various input modalities. Furthermore, we propose three automatic evaluation metrics, including code pass rate, text-match ratio, and GPT-4V overall rating, for a fine-grained assessment of the output code and rendered images. Instead of simply judging pass or fail, we employ GPT-4V to make an overall judgement between the generated and reference images, which has been shown to be consistent with human evaluation. The evaluation results, which include analyses of 14 MLLMs such as the proprietary GPT-4V, Gemini-Pro, and the open-sourced Mini-Gemini, highlight the substantial challenges presented by Plot2Code.

The current mainstream approach uses neural networks to encode natural language descriptions, and output abstract syntax trees (AST) at the decoder, then convert the AST into program code. While the generated code largely conforms to specific syntax rules, two problems are still ignored. One is missing program testing, an essential step in the process of complete code implementation; the other is only focusing on the syntax compliance of the generated code, while ignoring the more important program functional requirements. The paper proposes a CodeGen-Test model, which adds program testing steps and incorporates program testing information to iteratively generate code that meets the functional requirements of the program, thereby improving the quality of code generation. At the same time, the paper proposes a new evaluation metric, test accuracy (Test-Acc), which represents the proportion of passing program test in generated code. Different from the previous evaluation metric, which only evaluates the quality of code generation from the perspective of character similarity, the Test-Acc can evaluate the quality of code generation from the Program functions. Moreover, the paper evaluates the CodeGen-test model on a python data set \"hearthstone legend\". The experimental results show the proposed method can effectively improve the quality of generated code.

Most state-of-the-art deep learning models for code generation use training strategies primarily designed for natural language. However, understanding and generating code requires a more rigorous comprehension of the code syntax and semantics. With this motivation, we develop an encoder-decoder Transformer model where both the encoder and decoder are explicitly trained to recognize the syntax and data flow in the source and target codes, respectively.

In contrast, self-instruct automatically generates proper paired data. However, it suffers from low diversity due to generating duplicates and cannot ensure the correctness of codes. To bridge the both paradigms, we propose \\textbf{Semi-Instruct}. It first converts diverse but improper codes from natural-instruct into proper instruction-code pairs through a method similar to self-instruct. To verify the correctness of generated codes, we design a novel way to construct test cases by generating cases' inputs and executing correct codes from natural-instruct to get outputs. Finally, diverse and correct instruction-code pairs are retained for instruction tuning. Experiments show that semi-instruct is significantly better than natural-instruct and self-instruct.

We then propose efficient alternatives to fine-tune the large pre-trained code model based on the above findings. Our experimental study shows that (1) lexical, syntactic and structural properties of source code are encoded in the lower, intermediate, and higher layers, respectively, while the semantic property spans across the entire model.

That is, test error falls off with the power law when increasing training data, model size, and computing resource. However, whether this law is suitable for the task of code understanding is not well studied, and most current language models for code understanding are about 100M parameters, which are relatively \"small\" compared to large language models. In this paper, we conduct extensive experiments to investigate the scaling law for the code understanding task by varying training data, model size, and computing resource. We validate that the test error of code understanding models falls off with the power law when using larger models, indicating that the scaling law is suitable for the code understanding task. Besides, we apply different scales of models to two downstream code understanding tasks, and find that the performance increases with larger scale of models. Finally, we train a large-scale code understanding model named CoLSBERT with 1.5B parameters on a large dataset using more computing resource, which outperforms previous work by a large margin. We will release our code and the CoLSBERT model when our paper is published."}

In our work, we further advance this concept by introducing a closed-loop framework, referred to as LLMs A s Tool Makers (LATM), where LLMs create their own reusable tools for problem-solving. Our approach consists of two phases: 1) tool making: an LLM acts as the tool maker that crafts tools for a set of tasks. 2) tool using: another LLM acts as the tool user, which applies the tool built by the tool maker for problem-solving. On the problem-solving server side, tool-making enables continual tool generation and caching as new requests emerge. This framework enables subsequent requests to access cached tools via their corresponding APIs, enhancing the efficiency of task resolution. Recognizing that tool-making requires more sophisticated capabilities, we assign this task to a powerful, albeit resource-intensive, model. Conversely, the simpler tool-using phase is delegated to a lightweight model. This strategic division of labor allows the once-off cost of tool-making to be spread over multiple instances of tool-using, significantly reducing average costs while maintaining strong performance. Furthermore, our method offers a functional cache through the caching and reuse of tools, which stores the functionality of a class of requests instead of the natural language responses from LLMs, thus extending the applicability of the conventional cache mechanism. We evaluate our approach across various complex reasoning tasks, including Big-Bench tasks. With GPT-4 as the tool maker and GPT-3.5 as the tool user, LATM demonstrates performance equivalent to using GPT-4 for both roles, but with a significantly reduced inference cost."}
{"id": "31", "arxiv": "2404.18864v1", "title": "Performance-Aligned LLMs for Generating Fast Code", "abstract": "Optimizing scientific software is a difficult task because codebases are often large and complex, and performance can depend upon several factors including the algorithm, its implementation, and hardware among others. Causes of poor performance can originate from disparate sources and be difficult to diagnose. Recent years have seen a multitude of work that use large language models (LLMs) to assist in software development tasks. However, these tools are trained to model the distribution of code as text, and are not specifically designed to understand performance aspects of code. In this work, we introduce a reinforcement learning based methodology to align the outputs of code LLMs with performance. This allows us to build upon the current code modeling capabilities of LLMs and extend them to generate better performing code. We demonstrate that our fine-tuned model improves the expected speedup of generated code over base models for a set of benchmark tasks from 0.9 to 1.6 for serial code and 1.9 to 4.5 for OpenMP code."}

And existing work has demonstrated that \"pre-training and fine-tuning\" paradigm enables Large Language Models (LLMs) improve fixing capabilities on APR. However, existing work mainly focuses on Full-Model Fine-Tuning (FMFT) for APR and limited research has been conducted on the execution-based evaluation of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for APR. Comparing to FMFT, PEFT can reduce computing resource consumption without compromising performance and has been widely adopted to other software engineering tasks. To fill this gap, we enhance the existing APR dataset by employing prompt engineering to create an instruction dataset, APR-INSTRUCTION, at first. Secondly, we fine-tune four pre-trained LLMs using four different PEFT methods with APR-INSTRUCTION. The best fine-tuned model fixes 58% more bugs than the state-of-the-art LLM-based APR techniques. The results also show that $(IA)^3$ improves the creativity of LLMs more effectively through fine-tuning and achieves the highest fixing capability compared to the other three PEFT methods. Thirdly, we explore the optimal configuration of PEFT hyperparameters, and assess the impact of instruction dataset size, showing that a larger number of parameters and a larger training dataset do not necessarily result in better performance for PEFT. Lastly, we analyze peak memory usage and trainable parameters to show the efficiency of PEFT. This work provides a comprehensive exploration of PEFT on APR and suggests potentially promising directions for extension to other software engineering downstream tasks. APR-INSTRUCTION, PEFT weights, and the fine-tuning code are publicly available as open-source resources."}

However, their application in the domain of code and compiler optimization remains underexplored. Training LLMs is resource-intensive, requiring substantial GPU hours and extensive data collection, which can be prohibitive. To address this gap, we introduce Meta Large Language Model Compiler (LLM Compiler), a suite of robust, openly available, pre-trained models specifically designed for code optimization tasks. Built on the foundation of Code Llama, LLM Compiler enhances the understanding of compiler intermediate representations (IRs), assembly language, and optimization techniques. The model has been trained on a vast corpus of 546 billion tokens of LLVM-IR and assembly code and has undergone instruction fine-tuning to interpret compiler behavior. LLM Compiler is released under a bespoke commercial license to allow wide reuse and is available in two sizes: 7 billion and 13 billion parameters. We also present fine-tuned versions of the model, demonstrating its enhanced capabilities in optimizing code size and disassembling from x86_64 and ARM assembly back into LLVM-IR. These achieve 77% of the optimising potential of an autotuning search, and 45% disassembly round trip (14% exact match). This release aims to provide a scalable, cost-effective foundation for further research and development in compiler optimization by both academic researchers and industry practitioners."}

This series includes six models: Qwen2.5-Coder-(0.5B/1.5B/3B/7B/14B/32B). As a code-specific model, Qwen2.5-Coder is built upon the Qwen2.5 architecture and continues pretrained on a vast corpus of over 5.5 trillion tokens. Through meticulous data cleaning, scalable synthetic data generation, and balanced data mixing, Qwen2.5-Coder demonstrates impressive code generation capabilities while retaining general and math skills. These models have been evaluated on a wide range of code-related tasks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across more than 10 benchmarks, including code generation, completion, reasoning, and repair, consistently outperforming larger models of the same model size. We believe that the release of the Qwen2.5-Coder series will advance research in code intelligence and, with its permissive licensing, support wider adoption by developers in real-world applications."}

Nonetheless, research on multilingual aspects of Code-LMs (i.e., LMs for code generation) such as cross-lingual transfer between different programming languages, language-specific data augmentation, and post-hoc LM adaptation, alongside exploitation of data sources other than the original textual content, has been much sparser than for their natural language counterparts. In particular, most mainstream Code-LMs have been pre-trained on source code files alone. In this work, we investigate the prospect of leveraging readily available compiler intermediate representations (IR) - shared across programming languages - to improve the multilingual capabilities of Code-LMs and facilitate cross-lingual transfer. To this end, we first compile SLTrans, a parallel dataset consisting of nearly 4M self-contained source code files coupled with respective intermediate representations. Next, starting from various base Code-LMs (ranging in size from 1.1B to 7.3B parameters), we carry out continued causal language modelling training on SLTrans, forcing the Code-LMs to (1) learn the IR language and (2) align the IR constructs with respective constructs of various programming languages. Our resulting models, dubbed IRCoder, display sizeable and consistent gains across a wide variety of code generation tasks and metrics, including prompt robustness, multilingual code completion, code understanding, and instruction following."}
{"id": "36", "arxiv": "2305.07922v2", "title": "CodeT5+: Open Code Large Language Models for Code Understanding and Generation", "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) pretrained on vast source code have achieved prominent progress in code intelligence. However, existing code LLMs have two main limitations in terms of architecture and pretraining tasks. First, they often adopt a specific architecture (encoder-only or decoder-only) or rely on a unified encoder-decoder network for different downstream tasks. The former paradigm is limited by inflexibility in applications while in the latter, the model is treated as a single system for all tasks, leading to suboptimal performance on a subset of tasks. Secondly, they often employ a limited set of pretraining objectives which might not be relevant to some downstream tasks and hence result in substantial performance degrade. To address these limitations, we propose ``CodeT5+'', a family of encoder-decoder LLMs for code in which component modules can be flexibly combined to suit a wide range of downstream code tasks. Such flexibility is enabled by our proposed mixture of pretraining objectives to mitigate the pretrain-finetune discrepancy. These objectives cover span denoising, contrastive learning, text-code matching, and causal LM pretraining tasks, on both unimodal and bimodal multilingual code corpora. Furthermore, we propose to initialize CodeT5+ with frozen off-the-shelf LLMs without training from scratch to efficiently scale up our models, and explore instruction-tuning to align with natural language instructions. We extensively evaluate CodeT5+ on over 20 code-related benchmarks in different settings, including zero-shot, finetuning, and instruction-tuning. We observe state-of-the-art (SoTA) model performance on various code-related tasks, such as code generation and completion, math programming, and text-to-code retrieval tasks. Particularly, our instruction-tuned CodeT5+ 16B achieves new SoTA results on HumanEval code generation task against other open code LLMs."}

There have been many studies that learn sequential or structural information for code representation. But sequence-based models and non-sequence-models both have their limitations. Researchers attempt to incorporate structural information to sequence-based models, but they only mine part of token-level hierarchical structure information. In this paper, we analyze how the complete hierarchical structure influences the tokens in code sequences and abstract this influence as a property of code tokens called hierarchical embedding. The hierarchical embedding is further divided into statement-level global hierarchy and token-level local hierarchy. Furthermore, we propose the Hierarchy Transformer (HiT), a simple but effective sequence model to incorporate the complete hierarchical embeddings of source code into a Transformer model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of hierarchical embedding on learning code structure with an experiment on variable scope detection task. Further evaluation shows that HiT outperforms SOTA baseline models and show stable training efficiency on three source code-related tasks involving classification and generation tasks across 8 different datasets."}
{"id": "38", "arxiv": "2306.10763v2", "title": "Guiding Language Models of Code with Global Context using Monitors", "abstract": "Language models of code (LMs) work well when the surrounding code provides sufficient context. This is not true when it becomes necessary to use types, functionality or APIs defined elsewhere in the repository or a linked library, especially those not seen during training. LMs suffer from limited awareness of such global context and end up hallucinating. Integrated development environments (IDEs) assist developers in understanding repository context using static analysis. We extend this assistance, enjoyed by developers, to LMs. We propose monitor-guided decoding (MGD) where a monitor uses static analysis to guide the decoding. We construct a repository-level dataset PragmaticCode for method-completion in Java and evaluate MGD on it. On models of varying parameter scale, by monitoring for type-consistent object dereferences, MGD consistently improves compilation rates and agreement with ground truth. Further, LMs with fewer parameters, when augmented with MGD, can outperform larger LMs. With MGD, SantaCoder-1.1B achieves better compilation rate and next-identifier match than the much larger text-davinci-003 model. We also conduct a generalizability study to evaluate the ability of MGD to generalize to multiple programming languages (Java, C# and Rust), coding scenarios (e.g., correct number of arguments to method calls), and to enforce richer semantic constraints (e.g., stateful API protocols).

It depends significantly on the programmatic context, such as the class that the code would reside in. To study this phenomenon, we introduce the task of generating class member functions given English documentation and the programmatic context provided by the rest of the class. This task is challenging because the desired code can vary greatly depending on the functionality the class provides (e.g., a sort function may or may not be available when we are asked to \"return the smallest element\" in a particular member variable list). We introduce CONCODE, a new large dataset with over 100,000 examples consisting of Java classes from online code repositories, and develop a new encoder-decoder architecture that models the interaction between the method documentation and the class environment. We also present a detailed error analysis suggesting that there is significant room for future work on this task."}

Therefore, as a critical task in software engineering, code summarization aims to generate brief natural language descriptions for source code. In this paper, we propose a new code summarization model named CodeSum. CodeSum exploits the attention-based sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) neural network with Structure-based Traversal (SBT) of Abstract Syntax Trees (AST). The AST sequences generated by SBT can better present the structure of ASTs and keep unambiguous. We conduct experiments on three large-scale corpora in different program languages, i.e., Java, C#, and SQL, in which Java corpus is our new proposed industry code extracted from Github. Experimental results show that our method CodeSum outperforms the state-of-the-art significantly."}

We train PanGu-Coder using a two-stage strategy: the first stage employs Causal Language Modelling (CLM) to pre-train on raw programming language data, while the second stage uses a combination of Causal Language Modelling and Masked Language Modelling (MLM) training objectives that focus on the downstream task of text-to-code generation and train on loosely curated pairs of natural language program definitions and code functions. Finally, we discuss PanGu-Coder-FT, which is fine-tuned on a combination of competitive programming problems and code with continuous integration tests. We evaluate PanGu-Coder with a focus on whether it generates functionally correct programs and demonstrate that it achieves equivalent or better performance than similarly sized models, such as CodeX, while attending a smaller context window and training on less data."}

These models have revolutionized NLP tasks, particularly in code generation, aiding developers in creating software with enhanced efficiency. Despite their advancements, challenges in balancing code snippet generation with effective test case generation and execution persist. To address these issues, this paper introduces Multi-Agent Assistant Code Generation (AgentCoder), a novel solution comprising a multi-agent framework with specialized agents: the programmer agent, the test designer agent, and the test executor agent. During the coding procedure, the programmer agent will focus on the code generation and refinement based on the test executor agent's feedback. The test designer agent will generate test cases for the generated code, and the test executor agent will run the code with the test cases and write the feedback to the programmer. This collaborative system ensures robust code generation, surpassing the limitations of single-agent models and traditional methodologies. Our extensive experiments on 9 code generation models and 12 enhancement approaches showcase AgentCoder's superior performance over existing code generation models and prompt engineering techniques across various benchmarks. For example, AgentCoder (GPT-4) achieves 96.3\\% and 91.8\\% pass@1 in HumanEval and MBPP datasets with an overall token overhead of 56.9K and 66.3K, while state-of-the-art obtains only 90.2\\% and 78.9\\% pass@1 with an overall token overhead of 138.2K and 206.5K."}

Previous work integrated reinforcement learning (RL) with compiler feedback for exploring the output space of LLMs to enhance code generation quality. However, the lengthy code generated by LLMs in response to complex human requirements makes RL exploration a challenge. Also, since the unit tests may not cover the complicated code, optimizing LLMs by using these unexecuted code snippets is ineffective. To tackle these challenges, we introduce StepCoder, a novel RL framework for code generation, consisting of two main components: CCCS addresses the exploration challenge by breaking the long sequences code generation task into a Curriculum of Code Completion Subtasks, while FGO only optimizes the model by masking the unexecuted code segments to provide Fine-Grained Optimization. In addition, we furthermore construct the APPS+ dataset for RL training, which is manually verified to ensure the correctness of unit tests. Experimental results show that our method improves the ability to explore the output space and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in corresponding benchmarks. Our dataset APPS+ and StepCoder are available online."}

While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved coding tasks in software languages such as Python, their application in HDL generation remains limited due to the scarcity of high-quality HDL data. Traditional methods of adapting LLMs for hardware design rely on synthetic HDL datasets, which often suffer from low quality because even advanced LLMs like GPT perform poorly in the HDL domain. Moreover, these methods focus solely on chat tasks and the Verilog language, limiting their application scenarios. In this paper, we observe that: (1) HDL code collected from the real world is of higher quality than code generated by LLMs. (2) LLMs like GPT-3.5 excel in summarizing HDL code rather than generating it. (3) An explicit language tag can help LLMs better adapt to the target language when there is insufficient data. Based on these observations, we propose an efficient LLM fine-tuning pipeline for HDL generation that integrates a multi-level summarization data synthesis process with a novel Chat-FIM-Tag supervised fine-tuning method. The pipeline enhances the generation of HDL code from natural language descriptions and enables the handling of various tasks such as chat and infilling incomplete code. Utilizing this pipeline, we introduce CodeV, a series of HDL generation LLMs. Among them, CodeV-All not only possesses a more diverse range of language abilities, i.e. Verilog and Chisel, and a broader scope of tasks, i.e. Chat and fill-in-middle (FIM), but it also achieves performance on VerilogEval that is comparable to or even surpasses that of CodeV-Verilog fine-tuned on Verilog only, making them the first series of open-source LLMs designed for multi-scenario HDL generation."}

To address this challenge, we introduce OriGen , a fully open-source framework that incorporates self-reflection capabilities and a novel dataset augmentation methodology for generating high-quality, large-scale RTL code. Our approach employs a code-tocode augmentation technique to enhance the quality of open-source RTL code datasets. Furthermore, OriGen can rectify syntactic errors through a self-reflection process that leverages compiler feedback. Experimental results demonstrate that OriGen significantly outperforms other open-source alternatives in RTL code generation. It surpasses the previous best-performing open-source LLM by 12.8% and even exceeds GPT-4 Turbo in the pass@1 metric on the VerilogEval-Human benchmark.

Thus, there is an urgent need to ensure that code generated by Code LLMs is correct and secure. Previous research has primarily focused on generating secure code, overlooking the fact that secure code also needs to be correct. This oversight can lead to a false sense of security. Currently, the community lacks a method to measure actual progress in this area, and we need solutions that address both security and correctness of code generation. This paper introduces a new benchmark, CodeGuard+, along with two new metrics, to measure Code LLMs' ability to generate both secure and correct code. Using our new evaluation methods, we show that the state-of-the-art defense technique, prefix tuning, may not be as strong as previously believed, since it generates secure code but sacrifices functional correctness. We also demonstrate that different decoding methods significantly affect the security of Code LLMs. Furthermore, we explore a new defense direction: constrained decoding for secure code generation. We propose new constrained decoding techniques to generate secure code. Our results reveal that constrained decoding is more effective than prefix tuning to improve the security of Code LLMs, without requiring a specialized training dataset. Moreover, our evaluations over eight state-of-the-art Code LLMs show that constrained decoding has strong performance to improve the security of Code LLMs, and our technique outperforms GPT-4."}

Discrete latent codes are appealing for this purpose, as they naturally allow sophisticated combinatorial search strategies. The latent codes are learned using a self-supervised learning principle, in which first a discrete autoencoder is trained on the output sequences, and then the resulting latent codes are used as intermediate targets for the end-to-end sequence prediction task. Based on these insights, we introduce the \\emph{Latent Programmer}, a program synthesis method that first predicts a discrete latent code from input/output examples, and then generates the program in the target language. We evaluate the Latent Programmer on two domains: synthesis of string transformation programs, and generation of programs from natural language descriptions.

These inefficiencies necessitate the research of automated refactoring methods for code optimization. Early research in code optimization employs rule-based methods and focuses on specific inefficiency issues, which are labor-intensive and suffer from the low coverage issue. Recent work regards the task as a sequence generation problem, and resorts to deep learning (DL) techniques such as large language models (LLMs). These methods typically prompt LLMs to directly generate optimized code. Although these methods show state-of-the-art performance, such one-step generation paradigm is hard to achieve an optimal solution. First, complex optimization methods such as combinatorial ones are hard to be captured by LLMs. Second, the one-step generation paradigm poses challenge in precisely infusing the knowledge required for effective code optimization within LLMs, resulting in under-optimized code.To address these problems, we propose to model this task from the search perspective, and propose a search-based LLMs framework named SBLLM that enables iterative refinement and discovery of improved optimization methods. SBLLM synergistically integrate LLMs with evolutionary search and consists of three key components: 1) an execution-based representative sample selection part that evaluates the fitness of each existing optimized code and prioritizes promising ones to pilot the generation of improved code; 2) an adaptive optimization pattern retrieval part that infuses targeted optimization patterns into the model for guiding LLMs towards rectifying and progressively enhancing their optimization methods; and 3) a genetic operator-inspired chain-of-thought prompting part that aids LLMs in combining different optimization methods and generating improved optimization methods."}

This work studies to what extent Large Language Models (LLMs) can simulate coding and algorithmic tasks to provide insights into general capabilities in such algorithmic reasoning tasks. We introduce benchmarks for straight-line programs, code that contains critical paths, and approximate and redundant instructions. We further assess the simulation capabilities of LLMs with sorting algorithms and nested loops and show that a routine's computational complexity directly affects an LLM's ability to simulate its execution. While the most powerful LLMs exhibit relatively strong simulation capabilities, the process is fragile, seems to rely heavily on pattern recognition, and is affected by memorisation. We propose a novel off-the-shelf prompting method, Chain of Simulation (CoSm), which instructs LLMs to simulate code execution line by line/follow the computation pattern of compilers. CoSm efficiently helps LLMs reduce memorisation and shallow pattern recognition while improving simulation performance. We consider the success of CoSm in code simulation to be inspirational for other general routine simulation reasoning tasks."}

The proposed framework includes a robust testing module to refine the generated EA operator through error-driven dialogue with LLMs, a dynamic selection strategy along with informative prompting-based crossover and mutation to fit textual optimization pipeline. Our approach facilitates the design of EA operators without the extensive demands for expert intervention, thereby speeding up the innovation of EA operators. Empirical studies across various MOP categories validate the robustness and superior performance of our proposed framework."}

When applying LLMs for code generation, recent works mainly focus on directing the models to articulate intermediate natural-language reasoning steps, as in chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, and then output code with the natural language or other structured intermediate steps. However, such output is not suitable for code translation or generation tasks since the standard CoT has different logical structures and forms of expression with the code. In this work, we introduce the universal code (UniCode) as the intermediate representation. It is a description of algorithm steps using a mix of conventions of programming languages, such as assignment operator, conditional operator, and loop. Hence, we collect an instruction dataset UniCoder-Instruct to train our model UniCoder on multi-task learning objectives. UniCoder-Instruct comprises natural-language questions, code solutions, and the corresponding universal code. The alignment between the intermediate universal code representation and the final code solution significantly improves the quality of the generated code. The experimental results demonstrate that UniCoder with the universal code significantly outperforms the previous prompting methods by a large margin, showcasing the effectiveness of the structural clues in pseudo-code."}

CoTexT supports downstream NL-PL tasks such as code summarizing/documentation, code generation, defect detection, and code debugging. We train CoTexT on different combinations of available PL corpus including both \"bimodal\" and \"unimodal\" data. Here, bimodal data is the combination of text and corresponding code snippets, whereas unimodal data is merely code snippets. We first evaluate CoTexT with multi-task learning: we perform Code Summarization on 6 different programming languages and Code Refinement on both small and medium size featured in the CodeXGLUE dataset. We further conduct extensive experiments to investigate CoTexT on other tasks within the CodeXGlue dataset, including Code Generation and Defect Detection. We consistently achieve SOTA results in these tasks, demonstrating the versatility of our models."}

Despite the success of code LLMs, there remain significant concerns about the actual capabilities and reliability of these models, \"whether these models really learn the semantics of code from the training data and leverage the learned knowledge to perform the SE tasks\". In this paper, we introduce EMPICA, a comprehensive framework designed to systematically and empirically evaluate the capabilities of code LLMs in understanding code semantics. Specifically, EMPICA systematically introduces controlled modifications/transformations into the input code and examines the models' responses. Generally, code LLMs must be robust to semantically equivalent code inputs and be sensitive to non-equivalent ones for all SE tasks. Specifically, for every SE task, given an input code snippet c and its semantic equivalent variants, code LLMs must robustly produce consistent/equivalent outputs while they are expected to generate different outputs for c and its semantic non-equivalent variants. Our experimental results on three representative code understanding tasks, including code summarization, method name prediction, and output prediction, reveal that the robustness and sensitivity of the state-of-the-art code LLMs to code transformations vary significantly across tasks and transformation operators. In addition, the code LLMs exhibit better robustness to the semantic preserving transformations than their sensitivity to the semantic non-preserving transformations. These results highlight a need to enhance the model's capabilities of understanding code semantics, especially the sensitivity property."}

However, neglecting grammar constraints is a fatal drawback of commonly used sequence-based code generation. In this paper, we devise a pushdown automaton (PDA)-based methodology to address this problem, exploiting the principle that PL is a subset of PDA recognizable language and code accepted by PDA is grammatical. Specifically, we construct a PDA module and design an algorithm to constrain the generation of sequence-based models to ensure grammatical correctness. Guided by this methodology, we further propose CodePAD, a sequence-based code generation framework equipped with a PDA module, to integrate the deduction of PDA into deep learning. Additionally, this framework can leverage states of PDA deduction (including state representation, state prediction task, and joint prediction with state) to assist models in learning PDA deduction. To comprehensively evaluate CodePAD, we construct a PDA for Python and conduct extensive experiments on four public benchmark datasets. CodePAD can leverage existing sequence-based models, and we show that it can achieve 100\\% grammatical correctness percentage on these benchmark datasets. Thus, it relatively improve 17\\% CodeBLEU on CONALA, 8\\% EM on DJANGO, and 15\\% CodeBLEU on JUICE-10K compared to base models.

To establish a strong baseline on this challenging task, we develop PaChiNCo, a 62B code language model (LM) for Python computational notebooks, which significantly outperforms public code LMs. Finally, we explore few-shot prompting strategies to elicit better code with step-by-step decomposition and NL explanation, showing the potential to improve the diversity and explainability of model predictions."}

Such models open up the possibility of multi-language code generation: could code generation models generalize knowledge from one language to another? Although contemporary code generation models can generate semantically correct Python code, little is known about their abilities with other languages. We propose MultiPL-E, a system for translating unit test-driven code generation benchmarks to new languages. We create the first massively multilingual code generation benchmark by using MultiPL-E to translate two popular Python code generation benchmarks to 18 additional programming languages. We use MultiPL-E to extend the HumanEval benchmark and MBPP benchmark to 18 languages that encompass a range of programming paradigms and popularity. Using these new parallel benchmarks, we evaluate the multi-language performance of three state-of-the-art code generation models: Codex, CodeGen, and InCoder. We find that Codex matches or even exceeds its performance on Python for several other languages. The range of programming languages represented in MultiPL-E allow us to explore the impact of language frequency and language features on model performance. Finally, the MultiPL-E approach of compiling code generation benchmarks to new programming languages is both scalable and extensible, making it straightforward to evaluate new models, benchmarks, and languages."}

Although current research has thoroughly examined the correctness of the code produced by code generation models, a vital aspect that plays a pivotal role in green computing and sustainability efforts has often been neglected. This paper presents EffiBench, a benchmark with 1,000 efficiency-critical coding problems to assess the efficiency of code generated by code generation models. EffiBench contains a diverse set of LeetCode coding problems. Each problem is paired with an executable human-written canonical solution, which obtains the SOTA efficiency on the LeetCode solution leaderboard. With EffiBench, we empirically examine the ability of 42 large language models (35 open-source and 7 closed-source) to generate efficient code. Our evaluation results demonstrate that the efficiency of the code generated by LLMs is generally worse than the efficiency of human-written canonical solutions. For example, GPT-4 generated code has an average \\textbf{3.12} times execution time that of the human-written canonical solutions. In the most extreme cases, the execution time and total memory usage of GPT-4 generated code are \\textbf{13.89} and \\textbf{43.92} times that of the canonical solutions.

An Extensive Study", "abstract": "The increasing development of LLMs in code generation has drawn significant attention among researchers. To enhance LLM-based code generation ability, current efforts are predominantly directed towards collecting high-quality datasets and leveraging diverse training technologies. However, there is a notable lack of comprehensive studies examining the limitations and boundaries of existing methods. To bridge this gap, we conducted an extensive empirical study evaluating the performance of three leading closed-source LLMs and six popular open-source LLMs on three commonly used benchmarks. Our investigation, which evaluated the length, cyclomatic complexity and API number of the generated code, revealed that these LLMs face challenges in generating successful code for more complex problems, and tend to produce code that is shorter yet more complicated as compared to canonical solutions. Additionally, we developed a taxonomy of bugs for incorrect codes that includes three categories and ten sub-categories, and analyzed the root cause for common bug types. To better understand the performance of LLMs in real-world projects, we also manually created a real-world benchmark RWPB. We analyzed bugs on RWPB to highlight distinct differences in bug distributions between actual scenarios and existing benchmarks. Finally, we propose a novel training-free iterative method that introduces self-critique, enabling LLMs to critique and correct their generated code based on bug types and compiler feedback. Our comprehensive and extensive study provides insights into the current limitations of LLM-based code generation and opportunities for enhancing the accuracy and quality of the generated code."}

However, current benchmarks primarily exercise LLMs' capability on common coding tasks (e.g., bubble sort, greatest common divisor), leaving domain-specific coding tasks (e.g., computation, system, cryptography) unexplored. To fill this gap, we propose a multi-domain code benchmark, DOMAINEVAL, designed to evaluate LLMs' coding capabilities thoroughly. Our pipeline works in a fully automated manner, enabling a push-bottom construction from code repositories into formatted subjects under study. Interesting findings are observed by evaluating 12 representative LLMs against DOMAINEVAL. We notice that LLMs are generally good at computation tasks while falling short on cryptography and system coding tasks. The performance gap can be as much as 68.94% (80.94% - 12.0%) in some LLMs. We also observe that generating more samples can increase the overall performance of LLMs, while the domain bias may even increase. The contributions of this study include a code generation benchmark dataset DOMAINEVAL, encompassing six popular domains, a fully automated pipeline for constructing code benchmarks, and an identification of the limitations of LLMs in code generation tasks based on their performance on DOMAINEVAL, providing directions for future research improvements.

However, repository-level code generation presents unique challenges, particularly due to the need to utilize information spread across multiple files within a repository. Specifically, successful generation depends on a solid grasp of both general, context-agnostic knowledge and specific, context-dependent knowledge. While LLMs are widely used for the context-agnostic aspect, existing retrieval-based approaches sometimes fall short as they are limited in obtaining a broader and deeper repository context. In this paper, we present CatCoder, a novel code generation framework designed for statically typed programming languages. CatCoder enhances repository-level code generation by integrating relevant code and type context. Specifically, it leverages static analyzers to extract type dependencies and merges this information with retrieved code to create comprehensive prompts for LLMs. To evaluate the effectiveness of CatCoder, we adapt and construct benchmarks that include 199 Java tasks and 90 Rust tasks. The results show that CatCoder outperforms the RepoCoder baseline by up to 14.44% and 17.35%, in terms of compile@k and pass@k scores. In addition, the generalizability of CatCoder is assessed using various LLMs, including both code-specialized models and general-purpose models. Our findings indicate consistent performance improvements across all models, which underlines the practicality of CatCoder. Furthermore, we evaluate the time consumption of CatCoder in a large open source repository, and the results demonstrate the scalability of CatCoder."}

To support both code-related understanding and generation tasks, recent works attempt to pre-train unified encoder-decoder models. However, such encoder-decoder framework is sub-optimal for auto-regressive tasks, especially code completion that requires a decoder-only manner for efficient inference. In this paper, we present UniXcoder, a unified cross-modal pre-trained model for programming language. The model utilizes mask attention matrices with prefix adapters to control the behavior of the model and leverages cross-modal contents like AST and code comment to enhance code representation. To encode AST that is represented as a tree in parallel, we propose a one-to-one mapping method to transform AST in a sequence structure that retains all structural information from the tree. Furthermore, we propose to utilize multi-modal contents to learn representation of code fragment with contrastive learning, and then align representations among programming languages using a cross-modal generation task. We evaluate UniXcoder on five code-related tasks over nine datasets. To further evaluate the performance of code fragment representation, we also construct a dataset for a new task, called zero-shot code-to-code search. Results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on most tasks and analysis reveals that comment and AST can both enhance UniXcoder."}

Therefore, we construct AICoderEval, a dataset focused on real-world tasks in various domains based on HuggingFace, PyTorch, and TensorFlow, along with comprehensive metrics for evaluation and enhancing LLMs' task-specific code generation capability.

However, despite their increased size and training dataset, code-LLMs still have limitations such as suggesting codes with syntactic errors, variable misuse etc. Some studies argue that code-LLMs perform well on coding tasks because they use self-attention and hidden representations to encode relations among input tokens. However, previous works have not studied what code properties are not encoded by code-LLMs. In this paper, we conduct a fine-grained analysis of attention maps and hidden representations of code-LLMs. Our study indicates that code-LLMs only encode relations among specific subsets of input tokens. Specifically, by categorizing input tokens into syntactic tokens and identifiers, we found that models encode relations among syntactic tokens and among identifiers, but they fail to encode relations between syntactic tokens and identifiers. We also found that fine-tuned models encode these relations poorly compared to their pre-trained counterparts. Additionally, larger models with billions of parameters encode significantly less information about code than models with only a few hundred million parameters."}

Most existing studies instruct LLMs to perform code translation and evaluate their performance by either running the generated outputs through test suites or comparing them to reference outputs (ground truth). These outputs, however, may contain not only executable source code but also additional non-code elements, such as natural language explanations or formatting tokens. We refer to the combination of source code and non-code elements as the output format. It is crucial to understand and address variations in output format, as non-code elements can interfere with evaluation metrics, resulting in biased assessments of model performance and comparisons. We conduct an empirical analysis of the outputs from eleven instruct-tuned open-source LLMs, across five PLs: C, C++, Go, Java, and Python. The results show that between 26.4% and 73.7% of outputs produced by our evaluated LLMs necessitate post-processing. To mitigate output format bias, we propose a strategic combination of prompt engineering and regular expressions that effectively extracts source code from mixed-format outputs, enabling the eleven open-source models to achieve an average Code Extraction Success Rate (CSR) of 92.73%. Our empirical study confirms that output format bias affects widely used execution-based metrics, i.e., Computational Accuracy (CA), and text-based metrics, i.e., BLEU, CodeBLEU and CrystalBLEU. Additionally, we test five closed-source LLMs and observe that they also generate varying distributions of output formats, which could lead to output format biases. Our results highlight the need to mitigate the output format bias to enable reliable evaluations in LLMs for code translation."}

LoRA usually offers the most favorable trade-off between cost and performance. Further investigation into the effects of these methods on both model robustness and code security reveals that larger models tend to demonstrate reduced robustness and less security.

To this end, we initiate the RepoQA benchmark to evaluate LLMs on long-context code understanding. Traditional needle testers ask LLMs to directly retrieve the answer from the context without necessary deep understanding. In RepoQA, we built our initial task, namely Searching Needle Function (SNF), which exercises LLMs to search functions given their natural-language description, i.e., LLMs cannot find the desired function if they cannot understand the description and code. RepoQA is multilingual and comprehensive: it includes 500 code search tasks gathered from 50 popular repositories across 5 modern programming languages.

Specifically, CodeS includes three modules: RepoSketcher, FileSketcher, and SketchFiller. RepoSketcher first generates a repository's directory structure for given requirements; FileSketcher then generates a file sketch for each file in the generated structure; SketchFiller finally fills in the details for each function in the generated file sketch. To rigorously assess CodeS on the NL2Repo task, we carry out evaluations through both automated benchmarking and manual feedback analysis. For benchmark-based evaluation, we craft a repository-oriented benchmark, SketchEval, and design an evaluation metric, SketchBLEU. For feedback-based evaluation, we develop a VSCode plugin for CodeS and engage 30 participants in conducting empirical studies.

However, not all reasoning tasks are easily expressible as code, e.g. tasks involving commonsense reasoning, moral decision-making, and sarcasm understanding. Our goal is to extend an LM's program synthesis skills to such tasks and evaluate the results via pseudo-programs, namely Python programs where some leaf function calls are left undefined. To that end, we propose, Code Generation and Emulated EXecution (CoGEX). CoGEX works by (1) training LMs to generate pseudo-programs, (2) teaching them to emulate their generated program's execution, including those leaf functions, allowing the LM's knowledge to fill in the execution gaps; and (3) using them to search over many programs to find an optimal one. To adapt the CoGEX model to a new task, we introduce a method for performing program search to find a single program whose pseudo-execution yields optimal performance when applied to all the instances of a given dataset. We show that our approach yields large improvements compared to standard in-context learning approaches on a battery of tasks, both algorithmic and soft reasoning. This result thus demonstrates that code synthesis can be applied to a much broader class of problems than previously considered. Our released dataset, fine-tuned models, and implementation can be found at \\url{https://github.com/nweir127/CoGEX}."}

Motivated by the emerging demand for latency-insensitive tasks with batched processing, this paper initiates the study of high-throughput LLM inference using limited resources, such as a single commodity GPU. We present FlexGen, a high-throughput generation engine for running LLMs with limited GPU memory. FlexGen can be flexibly configured under various hardware resource constraints by aggregating memory and computation from the GPU, CPU, and disk. By solving a linear programming problem, it searches for efficient patterns to store and access tensors. FlexGen further compresses the weights and the attention cache to 4 bits with negligible accuracy loss. These techniques enable FlexGen to have a larger space of batch size choices and thus significantly increase maximum throughput. As a result, when running OPT-175B on a single 16GB GPU, FlexGen achieves significantly higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art offloading systems, reaching a generation throughput of 1 token/s for the first time with an effective batch size of 144. On the HELM benchmark, FlexGen can benchmark a 30B model with a 16GB GPU on 7 representative sub-scenarios in 21 hours. The code is available at https://github.com/FMInference/FlexGen"}

Despite the active exploration of LLMs for a variety of code tasks, either from the perspective of natural language processing (NLP) or software engineering (SE) or both, there is a noticeable absence of a comprehensive and up-to-date literature review dedicated to LLM for code generation. In this survey, we aim to bridge this gap by providing a systematic literature review that serves as a valuable reference for researchers investigating the cutting-edge progress in LLMs for code generation. We introduce a taxonomy to categorize and discuss the recent developments in LLMs for code generation, covering aspects such as data curation, latest advances, performance evaluation, ethical implications, environmental impact, and real-world applications. In addition, we present a historical overview of the evolution of LLMs for code generation and offer an empirical comparison using the HumanEval, MBPP, and BigCodeBench benchmarks across various levels of difficulty and types of programming tasks to highlight the progressive enhancements in LLM capabilities for code generation.

Despite being studied for a long time, a bottleneck for existing approaches is that given a code snippet, they can only generate one comment while developers usually need to know information from diverse perspectives such as what is the functionality of this code snippet and how to use it. To tackle this limitation, this study empirically investigates the feasibility of utilizing large language models (LLMs) to generate comments that can fulfill developers' diverse intents. Our intuition is based on the facts that (1) the code and its pairwise comment are used during the pre-training process of LLMs to build the semantic connection between the natural language and programming language, and (2) comments in the real-world projects, which are collected for the pre-training, usually contain different developers' intents. We thus postulate that the LLMs can already understand the code from different perspectives after the pre-training. Indeed, experiments on two large-scale datasets demonstrate the rationale of our insights: by adopting the in-context learning paradigm and giving adequate prompts to the LLM (e.g., providing it with ten or more examples), the LLM can significantly outperform a state-of-the-art supervised learning approach on generating comments with multiple intents. Results also show that customized strategies for constructing the prompts and post-processing strategies for reranking the results can both boost the LLM's performances, which shed light on future research directions for using LLMs to achieve comment generation."}

Despite the promising performance, LLMs are prone to generate hallucinations, which means LLMs might produce outputs that deviate from users' intent, exhibit internal inconsistencies, or misalign with the factual knowledge, making the deployment of LLMs potentially risky in a wide range of applications. Existing work mainly focuses on investing the hallucination in the domain of natural language generation (NLG), leaving a gap in understanding the types and extent of hallucinations in the context of code generation. To bridge the gap, we conducted a thematic analysis of the LLM-generated code to summarize and categorize the hallucinations present in it. Our study established a comprehensive taxonomy of hallucinations in LLM-generated code, encompassing 5 primary categories of hallucinations depending on the conflicting objectives and varying degrees of deviation observed in code generation. Furthermore, we systematically analyzed the distribution of hallucinations, exploring variations among different LLMs and their correlation with code correctness. Based on the results, we proposed HalluCode, a benchmark for evaluating the performance of code LLMs in recognizing hallucinations. Hallucination recognition and mitigation experiments with HalluCode and HumanEval show existing LLMs face great challenges in recognizing hallucinations, particularly in identifying their types, and are hardly able to mitigate hallucinations. We believe our findings will shed light on future research about hallucination evaluation, detection, and mitigation, ultimately paving the way for building more effective and reliable code LLMs in the future."}

Memory-augmented LLMs are a promising solution, but current approaches cannot handle long output generation tasks since they (1) only focus on reading memory and reduce its evolution to the concatenation of new memories or (2) use very specialized memories that cannot adapt to other domains. This paper presents L2MAC, the first practical LLM-based general-purpose stored-program automatic computer (von Neumann architecture) framework, an LLM-based multi-agent system, for long and consistent output generation. Its memory has two components: the instruction registry, which is populated with a prompt program to solve the user-given task, and a file store, which will contain the final and intermediate outputs. Each instruction in turn is executed by a separate LLM agent, whose context is managed by a control unit capable of precise memory reading and writing to ensure effective interaction with the file store. These components enable L2MAC to generate extensive outputs, bypassing the constraints of the finite context window while producing outputs that fulfill a complex user-specified task. We empirically demonstrate that L2MAC achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating large codebases for system design tasks, significantly outperforming other coding methods in implementing the detailed user-specified task; we show that L2MAC works for general-purpose extensive text-based tasks, such as writing an entire book; and we provide valuable insights into L2MAC's performance improvement over existing methods."}

To tackle this challenge, we propose Self-Organized multi-Agent framework (SoA), a novel multi-agent framework that enables the scalable and efficient generation and optimization of large-scale code. In SoA, self-organized agents operate independently to generate and modify code components while seamlessly collaborating to construct the overall codebase. A key feature of our framework is the automatic multiplication of agents based on problem complexity, allowing for dynamic scalability. This enables the overall code volume to be increased indefinitely according to the number of agents, while the amount of code managed by each agent remains constant. We evaluate SoA on the HumanEval benchmark and demonstrate that, compared to a single-agent system, each agent in SoA handles significantly less code, yet the overall generated code is substantially greater. Moreover, SoA surpasses the powerful single-agent baseline by 5% in terms of Pass@1 accuracy."}

The framework consists of three agents: a Coding Agent responsible for code generation, a Static Analyzer Agent identifying vulnerabilities, and a Fuzzing Agent performing dynamic testing using a mutation-based fuzzing approach to detect runtime errors. Our contribution focuses on ensuring the safety of multi-agent code generation by integrating dynamic and static testing in an iterative process during code generation by LLM that improves security.

CoCoGen first leverages static analysis to identify mismatches between the generated code and the project's context. It then iteratively aligns and fixes the identified errors using information extracted from the code repository. We integrate CoCoGen with two representative LLMs, i.e., GPT-3.5-Turbo and Code Llama (13B), and apply it to Python code generation.

As source code is discrete and has to strictly stick to complex grammar and semantics constraints, the adversarial example generation techniques in other domains are hardly applicable. Moreover, the adversarial example generation techniques specific to deep code models still suffer from unsatisfactory effectiveness due to the enormous ingredient search space. In this work, we propose a novel adversarial example generation technique (i.e., CODA) for testing deep code models. Its key idea is to use code differences between the target input (i.e., a given code snippet as the model input) and reference inputs (i.e., the inputs that have small code differences but different prediction results with the target input) to guide the generation of adversarial examples. It considers both structure differences and identifier differences to preserve the original semantics. Hence, the ingredient search space can be largely reduced as the one constituted by the two kinds of code differences, and thus the testing process can be improved by designing and guiding corresponding equivalent structure transformations and identifier renaming transformations. Our experiments on 15 deep code models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CODA, the naturalness of its generated examples, and its capability of enhancing model robustness after adversarial fine-tuning. For example, CODA reveals 88.05% and 72.51% more faults in models than the state-of-the-art techniques (i.e., CARROT and ALERT) on average, respectively."}

We establish an off-the-shelf encoder model that persistently outperforms the existing models on a wide variety of downstream tasks by large margins. To comprehend the factors contributing to successful code representation learning, we conduct detailed ablations and share our findings on (i) a customized and effective token-level denoising scheme for source code; (ii) the importance of hard negatives and hard positives; (iii) how the proposed bimodal contrastive learning boost the cross-lingual semantic search performance; and (iv) how the pretraining schemes decide the downstream task performance scales with the model size."}

{"id": "111", "arxiv": "2309.15432v1", "title": "ComPile: A Large IR Dataset from Production Sources", "abstract": "Code is increasingly becoming a core data modality of modern machine learning research impacting not only the way we write code with conversational agents like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Bard, or Anthropic's Claude, the way we translate code from one language into another, but also the compiler infrastructure underlying the language. While modeling approaches may vary and representations differ, the targeted tasks often remain the same within the individual classes of models. Relying solely on the ability of modern models to extract information from unstructured code does not take advantage of 70 years of programming language and compiler development by not utilizing the structure inherent to programs in the data collection. This detracts from the performance of models working over a tokenized representation of input code and precludes the use of these models in the compiler itself. To work towards the first intermediate representation (IR) based models, we fully utilize the LLVM compiler infrastructure, shared by a number of languages, to generate a 182B token dataset of LLVM IR. We generated this dataset from programming languages built on the shared LLVM infrastructure, including Rust, Swift, Julia, and C/C++, by hooking into LLVM code generation either through the language's package manager or the compiler directly to extract the dataset of intermediate representations from production grade programs. Statistical analysis proves the utility of our dataset not only for large language model training, but also for the introspection into the code generation process itself with the dataset showing great promise for machine-learned compiler components."}

However, the current state-of-the-art code LMs (e.g., Codex (Chen et al., 2021)) are not publicly available, leaving many questions about their model and data design decisions. We aim to fill in some of these blanks through a systematic evaluation of the largest existing models: Codex, GPT-J, GPT-Neo, GPT-NeoX-20B, and CodeParrot, across various programming languages. Although Codex itself is not open-source, we find that existing open-source models do achieve close results in some programming languages, although targeted mainly for natural language modeling. We further identify an important missing piece in the form of a large open-source model trained exclusively on a multi-lingual corpus of code. We release a new model, PolyCoder, with 2.7B parameters based on the GPT-2 architecture, which was trained on 249GB of code across 12 programming languages on a single machine. In the C programming language, PolyCoder outperforms all models including Codex. Our trained models are open-source and publicly available at https://github.com/VHellendoorn/Code-LMs, which enables future research and application in this area."}

However, the vast majority of testing suites assume that the instructions are written in English, the de facto prompting language. Code intelligence and problem solving still remain a difficult task, even for the most advanced LLMs. Currently, there are no datasets to measure the generalization power for code-generation models in a language other than English. In this work, we present RoCode, a competitive programming dataset, consisting of 2,642 problems written in Romanian, 11k solutions in C, C++ and Python and comprehensive testing suites for each problem. The purpose of RoCode is to provide a benchmark for evaluating the code intelligence of language models trained on Romanian / multilingual text as well as a fine-tuning set for pretrained Romanian models. Through our results and review of related works, we argue for the need to develop code models for languages other than English."}

Research explores their use both as autonomous agents and as tools for software engineering. LLM-integrated applications, on the other hand, are software systems that leverage an LLM to perform tasks that would otherwise be impossible or require significant coding effort. While LLM-integrated application engineering is emerging as new discipline, its terminology, concepts and methods need to be established. This study provides a taxonomy for LLM-integrated applications, offering a framework for analyzing and describing these systems. It also demonstrates various ways to utilize LLMs in applications, as well as options for implementing such integrations. Following established methods, we analyze a sample of recent LLM-integrated applications to identify relevant dimensions. We evaluate the taxonomy by applying it to additional cases. This review shows that applications integrate LLMs in numerous ways for various purposes. Frequently, they comprise multiple LLM integrations, which we term ``LLM components''. To gain a clear understanding of an application's architecture, we examine each LLM component separately. We identify thirteen dimensions along which to characterize an LLM component, including the LLM skills leveraged, the format of the output, and more. LLM-integrated applications are described as combinations of their LLM components. We suggest a concise representation using feature vectors for visualization. The taxonomy is effective for describing LLM-integrated applications. It can contribute to theory building in the nascent field of LLM-integrated application engineering and aid in developing such systems. Researchers and practitioners explore numerous creative ways to leverage LLMs in applications. Though challenges persist, integrating LLMs may revolutionize the way software systems are built."}

CodeBERT learns general-purpose representations that support downstream NL-PL applications such as natural language codesearch, code documentation generation, etc. We develop CodeBERT with Transformer-based neural architecture, and train it with a hybrid objective function that incorporates the pre-training task of replaced token detection, which is to detect plausible alternatives sampled from generators. This enables us to utilize both bimodal data of NL-PL pairs and unimodal data, where the former provides input tokens for model training while the latter helps to learn better generators. We evaluate CodeBERT on two NL-PL applications by fine-tuning model parameters. Results show that CodeBERT achieves state-of-the-art performance on both natural language code search and code documentation generation tasks. Furthermore, to investigate what type of knowledge is learned in CodeBERT, we construct a dataset for NL-PL probing, and evaluate in a zero-shot setting where parameters of pre-trained models are fixed. Results show that CodeBERT performs better than previous pre-trained models on NL-PL probing."}

However, due to their monolithic structure, it is challenging and expensive to augment them or impart new skills. On the other hand, due to their adaptation abilities, several new instances of these models are being trained towards new domains and tasks. In this work, we study the problem of efficient and practical composition of existing foundation models with more specific models to enable newer capabilities. To this end, we propose CALM -- Composition to Augment Language Models -- which introduces cross-attention between models to compose their representations and enable new capabilities. Salient features of CALM are: (i) Scales up LLMs on new tasks by 're-using' existing LLMs along with a few additional parameters and data, (ii) Existing model weights are kept intact, and hence preserves existing capabilities, and (iii) Applies to diverse domains and settings. We illustrate that augmenting PaLM2-S with a smaller model trained on low-resource languages results in an absolute improvement of up to 13\\% on tasks like translation into English and arithmetic reasoning for low-resource languages. Similarly, when PaLM2-S is augmented with a code-specific model, we see a relative improvement of 40\\% over the base model for code generation and explanation tasks -- on-par with fully fine-tuned counterparts."}

Towards Efficient Code Generation in LLMs with Excess Token Prevention", "abstract": "Code generation aims to automatically generate code snippets that meet given natural language requirements and plays an important role in software development. Although Code LLMs have shown excellent performance in this domain, their long generation time poses a signification limitation in practice use. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth preliminary study with different Code LLMs on code generation tasks and identify a significant efficiency issue, i.e., continual generation of excess tokens. It harms the developer productivity and leads to huge computational wastes. To address it, we introduce CodeFast, an inference acceleration approach for Code LLMs on code generation. The key idea of CodeFast is to terminate the inference process in time when unnecessary excess tokens are detected. First, we propose an automatic data construction framework to obtain training data. Then, we train a unified lightweight model GenGuard applicable to multiple programming languages to predict whether to terminate inference at the current step. Finally, we enhance Code LLM with GenGuard to accelerate its inference in code generation tasks. We conduct extensive experiments with CodeFast on five representative Code LLMs across four widely used code generation datasets. Experimental results show that (1) CodeFast can significantly improve the inference speed of various Code LLMs in code generation, ranging form 34% to 452%, without compromising the quality of generated code. (2) CodeFast is stable across different parameter settings and can generalize to untrained datasets. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/CodeFast"}

LLM agents are typically prompted to produce actions by generating JSON or text in a pre-defined format, which is usually limited by constrained action space (e.g., the scope of pre-defined tools) and restricted flexibility (e.g., inability to compose multiple tools). This work proposes to use executable Python code to consolidate LLM agents' actions into a unified action space (CodeAct). Integrated with a Python interpreter, CodeAct can execute code actions and dynamically revise prior actions or emit new actions upon new observations through multi-turn interactions. Our extensive analysis of 17 LLMs on API-Bank and a newly curated benchmark shows that CodeAct outperforms widely used alternatives (up to 20% higher success rate). The encouraging performance of CodeAct motivates us to build an open-source LLM agent that interacts with environments by executing interpretable code and collaborates with users using natural language. To this end, we collect an instruction-tuning dataset CodeActInstruct that consists of 7k multi-turn interactions using CodeAct. We show that it can be used with existing data to improve models in agent-oriented tasks without compromising their general capability. CodeActAgent, finetuned from Llama2 and Mistral, is integrated with Python interpreter and uniquely tailored to perform sophisticated tasks (e.g., model training) using existing libraries and autonomously self-debug."}
