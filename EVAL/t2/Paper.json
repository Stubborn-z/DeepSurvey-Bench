  "abstract": "The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven their\nexpanding application across various fields. One of the most promising\napplications is their role as evaluators based on natural language responses,\nreferred to as ''LLMs-as-judges''. This framework has attracted growing\nattention from both academia and industry due to their excellent effectiveness,\nability to generalize across tasks, and interpretability in the form of natural\nlanguage. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the LLMs-as-judges\nparadigm from five key perspectives: Functionality, Methodology, Applications,\nMeta-evaluation, and Limitations. We begin by providing a systematic definition\nof LLMs-as-Judges and introduce their functionality (Why use LLM judges?). Then\nwe address methodology to construct an evaluation system with LLMs (How to use\nLLM judges?). Additionally, we investigate the potential domains for their\napplication (Where to use LLM judges?) and discuss methods for evaluating them\nin various contexts (How to evaluate LLM judges?). Finally, we provide a\ndetailed analysis of the limitations of LLM judges and discuss potential future\ndirections. Through a structured and comprehensive analysis, we aim aims to\nprovide insights on the development and application of LLMs-as-judges in both\nresearch and practice.

      "content": "Studies on evaluation methods have long been a key force in guiding the development of modern Artificial Intelligence (AI)~chang2024survey. AI researchers have continuously sought to measure and validate the intelligence of AI models through various tasks~chang2024survey,guo2023evaluating. In the mid-20th century, AI evaluation primarily centered on assessing algorithm performance in specific tasks, such as logical reasoning and numerical computation~nilsson2014principles. Traditional machine learning tasks like classification and regression often use programmable and statistical metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall. With the emergence of deep learning, the complexity of AI systems grew rapidly, prompting a shift in evaluation standards~lecun2015deep. The evaluation of AI has expanded from pre-defined, programmable machine metrics to more flexible, robust evaluators for solving complex, realistic tasks. A typical example is the Turing Test~french2000turing,turing2009computing, which determines whether an AI model can exhibit human-like intelligent behavior through dialogue with humans. The Turing Test provides a fundamental guideline in the evaluation of AI models, especially on AI models' intelligence in flexible and realistic environments. Recently, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI serves as a new milestone in the evolution of AI evaluation. LLMs exhibit remarkable generalization and adaptability, showcasing strong transfer capabilities across previously unseen tasks and diverse domains~achiam2023gpt,bai2023qwen. However, their powerful capabilities also present new challenges for evaluation. Due to the highly generative and open-ended nature of their outputs, standardized metrics are often insufficient for a comprehensive evaluation. For example, in natural language generation (NLG) tasks, traditional metrics like BLEU~papineni2002bleu and ROUGE~lin2004rouge often fail to capture key aspects such as text fluency, logical coherence, and creativity. Moreover, modern AI evaluation extends beyond task performance and must account for the ability to address complex, dynamic problems in real-world scenarios, including robustness, fairness, and interpretability. Human annotations, frequently regarded as the ``ground truth,'' can offer comprehensive insights and valuable feedback. By gathering responses from experts or users, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of a model's performance, practicality, and potential risks. However, collecting them are typically time-consuming and resource-intensive, making it challenging to scale up for large-scale evaluation. In this context, a new paradigm has emerged to replace humans and statistical metrics with LLMs in evaluation, referred to as LLMs-as-judges~ashktorab2024aligning,tseng2024expert,bavaresco2024llms,bavaresco2024llms. Compared to traditional evaluation methods, LLMs-as-judges show significant strengths. First, LLM judges can adjust their evaluation criteria based on the specific task context, rather than relying on a fixed set of metrics, making the evaluation process more flexible and refined. Second, LLM judges can generate interpretive evaluations, offering more comprehensive feedback on model performance and enabling researchers to gain deeper insights into the evaluater's strengths and weaknesses. Finally, LLM judges offer a scalable and reproducible alternative to human evaluation, significantly reducing the costs and time associated with human involvement. Despite its great potential and significant advantages, LLMs-as-judges also face several critical challenges. For example, the evaluation results of LLMs are often influenced by the prompt template, which can lead to biased or inconsistent assessments~xu2023llm. Considering that LLMs are trained on extensive text corpus, they may also inherit various implicit biases, impacting the fairness and reliability of their assessments~ye2024justice. Moreover, distinct tasks and domains require specific evaluation criteria, making it difficult for LLMs to adapt their standards dynamically to specific contexts. Considering the vast potential of this field, this survey aims to systematically review and analyze the current state and key challenges of the LLMs-as-judges. As shown in Figures Taxonomy_1 and Taxonomy_2, we discuss existing research across five key perspectives: 1) Functionality: Why use LLM judges, 2) Methodology: How to use LLM judges, 3) Application: Where to use LLM judges, 4) Meta-evaluation: How to evaluate LLM judges and 5) Limitation: Existing problems of LLM judges. We explore the key challenges confronting LLMs-as-judges and hope to provide a clearer guideline for their future development. In summary, the main contributions of this paper are as follows: enumerate \\item Comprehensive and Timely Survey: We present the extensive survey on the emerging paradigm of LLMs-as-judges, systematically reviewing the current state of research and developments in this field. By examining LLMs as performance evaluators based on their generated natural language, we highlight the unique role of LLMs in shaping the future of AI evaluation. \\item Systematic Analysis Across Five Key Perspectives: We organize our survey around five critical aspects: Functionality, Methodology, Application, Meta-evaluation, and Limitation. This structured approach allows for a nuanced understanding of how and why LLMs are utilized as evaluators, their practical implementations, and reliability concerns. \\item Current Challenges and Future Research Directions: We discuss the existing challenges for adopting LLMs-as-judges, highlighting potential research opportunities and directions while offering a forward-looking perspective on the future development of this paradigm, encouraging researchers to delve deeper into this exciting area. We also provide an open-source repository at https://github.com/CSHaitao/Awesome-LLMs-as-Judges, with the goal of fostering a collaborative community and advancing best practices in this area. enumerate The organization of this paper is as follows. In Section (\\Ssec:PRELIMINARIES), we provide the formal definition of LLMs-as-judges. Then, Section (\\Ssec:Functionality) reviews existing work from the perspective of ``Why use LLM judges''. Following that, Section (\\Ssec:Methodology) covers ``How to use LLM judges'', summarizing the current technical developments in LLMs-as-judges. Section (\\Ssec:Domain) discusses ``Where to use LLM judges'', focusing on their application domains. In Section (\\Ssec:Meta), we review the metrics and benchmarks used for evaluating LLMs-as-judges. Section (\\Ssec:Limitation) discusses the limitations and challenges of LLM judges. We discuss major future work in Sections (\\Ssec:Future) and (\\Ssec:Conclusion) to conclude the paper. my-box= [ rectangle, draw=hidden-draw, rounded corners, text opacity=1, minimum height=1.5em,

Figure figure:overreview presents an overview of the LLMs-as-judges system. The LLMs-as-judges paradigm is a flexible and powerful evaluation framework where LLMs are employed as evaluative tools, responsible for assessing the quality, relevance, and effectiveness of generated outputs based on defined evaluation criteria. This framework leverages the extensive knowledge and deep contextual understanding of LLMs, enabling it to flexibly adapt to various tasks in NLP and machine learning. We formalize the input-output structure of the LLMs-as-Judges paradigm, unifying various evaluation scenarios into a unified perspective. Specifically, the evaluation process can be defined as follows: equation (Y, E, F)=E(T, C, X, R) equation where $E$ is the evaluation function, taking the evaluation type $T$, evaluation criteria $C$, evaluation item $X$ and optional references $R$ as input. Based on these inputs, the LLM can produces three outputs: evaluation result $Y$, explanation $E$ and feedback $F$. Different input-output configurations correspond to distinct methods and objectives. This unified formulation brings together diverse evaluation paradigms, offering a structured framework for categorizing and understanding various approaches within LLMs-as-judges.",

Each of these configurations serves distinct purposes, offers different advantages, and faces unique challenges. itemize[leftmargin=*] \\item Single-LLM Evaluation System~\\cite{lin2023llm,zhang2024talec,liu2023g: } A single LLM evaluation system relies on a single model to perform the evaluation tasks. It is simple to deploy and scale, making it efficient for tasks that don't require specialized evaluation. However, its flexibility is limited, as it may struggle with tasks that demand specialized knowledge or reasoning over complex inputs. Additionally, if not properly trained, a single model may introduce biases, leading to inaccurate evaluations. \\item Multi-LLM Evaluation Systems~\\cite{chu2024pre,chan2023chateval,li2023prd: } A Multi-LLM evaluation system combines multiple models that work together to perform evaluation tasks. These models may interact through various mechanisms, such as collaboration, or competition, to refine their outputs and achieve more accurate results. By leveraging the strengths of different models, a multi-model system can cover a broader range of evaluation criteria and provide a more comprehensive assessment. However, this comes at a higher computational cost and requires more resources, making deployment and maintenance more challenging, particularly for large-scale tasks. Moreover, while cooperation between models often enhances evaluation results, the methods through which these models achieve consensus or resolve differences remain key areas of ongoing exploration. \\item Human-AI Collaboration System~\\cite{li2023collaborative,wang2023large,shankar2024validates: } In this system, LLMs work alongside human evaluators, combining the efficiency of automated evaluation with the nuanced judgment of human expertise. This configuration allows human evaluators to mitigate potential biases in the LLM's output and provide subjective insights into complex evaluation tasks. While this system offers greater reliability and depth, it comes with challenges in coordinating between the models and humans, ensuring consistent evaluation standards, and integrating feedback. Additionally, the inclusion of human evaluators increases both the cost and time required for the evaluation process, making it less scalable than purely model-based systems. itemize",

      "content": "$} The Evaluation Type $T$ defines the specific evaluation mode, determining how the evaluation will be conducted. It typically includes three approaches: pointwise, pairwise, and listwise evaluation. itemize[leftmargin=*] \\item Pointwise Evaluation~\\cite{wang2023learning,kim2023prometheus,ye2024self:} This method evaluates each candidate item individually based on the specified criteria. For example, in a text summarization task, the LLM might evaluate each generated summary separately, assigning a score based on factors like informativeness, coherence, and conciseness. Although pointwise evaluation is simple and easy to apply, it may fail to capture the relative quality differences between candidates and can be influenced by biases arising from evaluating items in isolation. \\item Pairwise Evaluation~\\cite{saad2023ares,cao2024compassjudger,he2024fedeval,hu2024rethinking:} This method involves directly comparing two candidate items to determine which one performs better according to the specified criteria. It is commonly used in preference-based tasks. For example, given two summaries of a news article, the LLM may be asked to decide which summary is more coherent or informative. Pairwise evaluation closely mirrors human decision-making processes by focusing on relative preferences rather than assigning absolute scores. This approach is especially effective when the differences between outputs are subtle and difficult to quantify. \\item Listwise Evaluation~\\cite{10.1145/3626772.3657813,yan-etal-2024-consolidating,hou2024large,niu2024judgerank:} This method is designed to collectively evaluate the entire list of candidate items, evaluating and ranking them based on the specific criteria. It is often applied in ranking tasks, such as document retrieval in search engines, where the objective is to determine the relevance of the documents in relation to a user query. Listwise evaluation takes into account the interactions between multiple candidates, making it well-suited for applications that require holistic analysis. itemize In general, these three evaluation modes are not entirely independent. pointwise scores can be aggregated to create pairwise comparisons or used to construct a ranked list. Similarly, pairwise preferences can be organized into a complete ranking list for listwise analysis. However, these transformations are not always reliable within the LLMs-as-judges framework~liu2024aligning. For example, in pointwise evaluation, output $A$ may receive a score of 5, while output $B$ receives a score of 4, yet, a direct pairwise comparison might not consistently yield $A > B$ due to potential bias. Additionally, LLM judges do not always satisfy transitivity in their judgments. For instance, given pairwise preferences where $z_i > z_j$ and $z_j > z_k$ , the LLM may not necessarily yield $z_i > z_k$. These inconsistencies contribute to concerns about the reliability and trustworthiness of the LLM-as-Judge framework, which we will discuss in detail in Section (\\Ssec:Limitation).",

Typically, the criteria encompass the following aspects: itemize[leftmargin=*] \\item Linguistic Quality~\\cite{fabbri2021summeval,zhang2018personalizing,chhun2022human:} This category evaluates the language-related features of the output, such as fluency, grammatical accuracy, coherence, and Conciseness. Linguistic quality is crucial in tasks like text generation, machine translation, and summarization, where clarity and readability are essential. \\item Content Accuracy~\\cite{chen2021evaluating,jimenez2023swe,tan2024judgebench:} This dimension focuses on the correctness and relevance of the content. It includes evaluating aspects such as factual accuracy, ensuring that the output does not contain misleading or incorrect information. Content accuracy is particularly crucial in tasks such as code generation and fact-checking. \\item Task-Specific Metrics~\\cite{ji2024pku,lin2024wildbench,tan2024judgebench:} In addition to general quality metrics, many tasks require evaluation based on standards specific to their respective domains. These standards may include metrics such as informativeness (assessing whether the output provides comprehensive and valuable information) or completeness (ensuring all key aspects of the input are covered). Other criteria may include diversity, well-structured content, and logical clarity. itemize In addition to providing clear evaluation criteria, offering several examples can also be beneficial for the assessment.

Depending on the availability of evaluation reference, the evaluation process can be broadly divided into reference-based and reference-free scenarios. itemize[leftmargin=*] \\item Reference-Based Evaluation~\\cite{freitag2021results,karpinska2023large: } The reference-based evaluation leverages reference data to determine whether the performance meets the expected standards. It is commonly applied in tasks where the quality of the output can be objectively judged by its similarity to established reference. In Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks, this method is widely used to evaluate the resemblance between generated content and reference content. For example, in machine translation or text summarization, an LLM can compare the generated translations or summaries against high-quality references. The key strength of this approach is its well-defined benchmarking process; however, its effectiveness may be constrained by the quality and variety of the reference data. \\item Reference-Free Evaluation~\\cite{shen2023opinsummeval,zheng2023judging,he2023socreval: } The reference-free evaluation does not rely on a specific reference $R$, instead, it evaluates $X$ based on intrinsic quality standards or its alignment with the source context. For example, when assessing language fluency or content coherence, an LLM can autonomously generate evaluation results using internal grammatical and semantic rules. This method is widely used in fields like sentiment analysis and dialogue generation. The main advantage of this approach is its independence from specific references, providing greater flexibility for open-ended tasks. However, its drawback lies in the difficulty of obtaining satisfactory evaluations in domains where the LLM lacks relevant knowledge. itemize",

Below are detailed descriptions. itemize[leftmargin=*] \\item Evaluation Result $\\mathcal{Y$~zhao2024auto,saad2023ares: } The evaluation result $Y$ is the primary output, which can take the form of a numerical score, a ranking, a categorical label, or a qualitative assessment. It reflects the quality, relevance, or performance of the candidate items according to the specified evaluation criteria. For example, in a machine translation task, $Y$ could be a score indicating translation quality, while in a dialogue generation task, it might be a rating of coherence and appropriateness on a scale from 1 to 5. The evaluation result $Y$ provides a clear measure of performance, enabling researchers to effectively compare different models or outputs. \\item Explanation $\\mathcal{E$~ye2024beyond,xie2024improving: } The explanation $E$ provides detailed reasoning and justifications for the evaluation result. It offers insights into why certain result received higher or lower scores, highlighting specific features of the candidate item that influenced the evaluation. For example, in a summarization task, the LLM judges might explain that the score was lowered due to missing critical information or the presence of redundant content. The explanation component enhances transparency, allowing users to understand the decision-making process of the LLM and gain deeper insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the evaluated content. \\item Feedback $\\mathcal{F$~madaan2024self,chen2023teaching: } The feedback $F$ consists of actionable suggestions or recommendations aimed at improving the evaluated output. Unlike the evaluation result, which merely indicates performance, the feedback component is designed to guide the refinement of the content. For instance, in a creative writing task, feedback might include recommendations for enhancing the narrative flow or improving clarity. This component is especially valuable for the iterative development of the evaluated item, as it provides concrete pointers that help both the LLM and content creators enhance the quality of the generated outputs. itemize Depending on the intended purpose and specific requirements of the evaluation, the LLM judges can generate various combinations of the three outputs ( $Y$, $E$, $F$ ) for a given task. In most cases, providing explanation $E$ not only helps users better understand and trust the evaluation results but also leads to more human-aligned and accurate evaluation result $Y$. Moreover, generating feedback $F$ generally demands a higher level of model capability, as it requires not only assessing the quality of the input but also providing concrete, actionable recommendations for improvement.",

These responses can originate from either AI models or humans. Evaluation criteria typically consider general attributes such as accuracy, relevance, coherence, and fluency. However, in practical applications, the evaluation of responses often requires customized metrics tailored to specific tasks. For instance, in the education domain, the focus may be more on the inspirational and educational value of the answers. LLM judges have also been widely applied in the assessment of text response~lin2023llm,wang2024automated,zhou2024llm. Lin et al.~lin2023llm propose LLM-Eval, a unified framework employing a single-prompt strategy to evaluate the performance of open-domain dialogue systems across multiple dimensions, including content, grammar, relevance, and appropriateness. Wang et al.~wang2024automated proposed an article scoring and feedback system tailored to different genres, such as essays, narratives, and question-answering articles. Using BERT and ChatGPT models, they enabled automated scoring and detailed feedback, showcasing the potential of LLMs in article evaluation. Moreover, Zhou et al.~zhou2024llm conduct a detailed evaluation of whether LLMs can serve as reliable tools for automated paper review. Their findings indicate that current LLMs are still not sufficiently reliable for such tasks, particularly in scenarios requiring logical reasoning or a deep knowledge base. Furthermore, the evaluation of a single response is not limited to assessing the quality of the final answer but can also extend to analyzing the response process~saad2023ares,asai2023self,lei2024recexplainer. For instance, this can include evaluating whether retrieval is necessary at a given step, the relevance of the retrieved documents, and the interpretability of the response. For example, ARES~saad2023ares uses LLM judges to evaluate RAG systems across three dimensions: Contextual Relevance, Answer Faithfulness, and Answer Relevance. Similarly, Asai et al. ~asai2023self proposed SELF-RAG, which employs reflective token to determine whether retrieval is required and to self-assess the quality of generated outputs. Lei et al.~lei2024recexplainer introduced LLMs to evaluate the quality of generated explanations, demonstrating the effectiveness of LLMs in understanding and generating explanations for recommendation tasks.",

This wider perspective aims to analyze the model's performance across various tasks or domains, such as coding ability, instruction-following proficiency, reasoning, and other specialized skills relevant to its intended applications. A common and straightforward approach is to represent model performance using average performance on static benchmarks~zheng2023judging,lin2024wildbench,tan2024judgebench. LLM judges assess the model's performance using a set of carefully designed metrics, which results in a performance ranking. This method is widely adopted due to its simplicity and comparability. For example, task sets can be designed to evaluate the model's knowledge coverage, reasoning depth, and language generation quality~son2024mm,liu2024rm,lambert2024rewardbench, or real-world scenarios can be simulated to assess the model's ability to handle complex situations~liu2023agentbench,trivedi2024appworld. As the demand for evaluation increases, the evaluation process has gradually shifted from traditional static testing to more dynamic, interactive assessments~bai2024benchmarking,zhao2024auto,yu2024kieval. LLMs-as-judges has pioneered this approach, similar to Chatbot Arena~zheng2023judging, a crowdsourced platform that collects anonymous votes on LLM performance and ranks them using Elo scores. Auto-Arena~zhao2024auto,luo2024videoautoarena and LMExam~bai2024benchmarking assess model capabilities by using LLMs as both question setters and evaluators. These frameworks innovatively combine diverse question generation, multi-turn question-answering evaluation, and a decentralized model-to-model evaluation mechanism, providing more detailed and granular performance assessments.

LLM judges assign scores to model outputs by evaluating them against human-defined criteria, guiding optimization toward desired behaviors. This ensures alignment with human values, improving the quality and relevance of the generated outputs and improving the effectiveness of LLMs in real-world tasks. A series of works, such as SRLMs~yuan2024self, OAIF~guo2024direct, and RLAIF~lee2023rlaif, have enabled LLMs to become their own reward models. This overcomes the traditional RLHF dependency on fixed reward models, allowing the model to iteratively reward and self-optimize, fostering self-evolution through continuous self-assessment. RELC~cao2024enhancing tackles the challenge of sparse rewards in traditional RL by introducing a Critic Language Model (Critic LM) to evaluate intermediate generation steps. This dense feedback at each step helps mitigate reward sparsity, offering more detailed guidance to the model during training. However, using the same LLM for both policy generation and reward modeling can pose challenges in ensuring the accuracy of the rewards. This dual role setup may lead to accumulated biases and preference data noise, which can undermine the training effectiveness. To address this issue, CREAM~wang2024cream introduces cross-iteration consistency constraints to regulate the training process and prevent the model from learning unreliable preference data. This significantly enhances reward consistency and alignment performance. In addition, CGPO~xu2024perfect groups tasks by category (such as dialogue, mathematical reasoning, safety, etc.) and uses ``Mixed Judges'' to assign a specific reward model to each task group. This ensures that the reward signals are closely aligned with the task objectives, thereby preventing conflicts between different goals.",

By comparing the outputs based on various metrics, such as factual accuracy and reasoning consistency, they are able to identify the best fit for the given task or context, thereby optimizing the inference process or improving the quality of the generated results. One of the simplest applications is Best-of-N sampling~jinnai2024regularized,sun2024fast, where the model is sampled N times, and the best result is selected to improve model performance. Similarly, Wang et al.~wang2022self introduced a promising sampling method called self-consistency, where n samples are drawn from the judge model, and the average score is output. These sampling methods enhance inference stability by selecting the best result from multiple evaluations. Further optimization strategies include the Tree of Thoughts (ToT)~yao2024tree method, which models the problem-solving process as a tree structure. This allows the model to explore multiple solution paths and optimize path selection through self-assessment mechanisms. The Graph of Thoughts (GoT)~besta2024graph method extends this concept by introducing directed graphs, where the non-linear interactions between nodes improve the efficiency and precision of multi-step reasoning. In both methods, LLM judges play a crucial role in guiding the model to select the most promising paths, thereby enhancing the quality and accuracy of reasoning. Similarly, Lightman et al.~lightman2023let discuss how step-by-step validation can enhance the performance of LLMs in multi-step reasoning tasks, particularly in the domain of mathematics. SE-GBS~xie2024self integrates self-assessment into the multi-step reasoning decoding process, generating scores that reflect logical correctness and further ensuring the accuracy and consistency of the reasoning chain.

This approach has significantly enhanced the performance of LLMs across various code generation tasks. In addition to refining response quality, LLMs judges are also widely used to enhance reasoning abilities. For example, REFINER~paul2023refiner optimizes the reasoning performance of LLMs through interactions between a generator model and a critic model. In this framework, the generator model is responsible for producing intermediate reasoning steps, while the critic model analyzes these steps and provides detailed feedback, such as identifying calculation errors or logical inconsistencies. Xu et al.~xu2023towards propose a multi-agent collaboration strategy to enhance the reasoning abilities of LLMs by simulating the academic peer review process. The framework is divided into three stages: generation, review, and revision. Agents provide feedback and attach confidence scores to refine the initial answers, with the final result determined through majority voting. While the feedback and correction mechanisms of LLMs judges are continually evolving, the limitations of self-feedback in improving quality should not be overlooked. Research on Self-Correct~huang2023large,tyen2023llms shows that, the intrinsic self-correction capabilities of LLMs often fall short of effectively improving reasoning quality. Valmeekam et al.~valmeekam2023can also raise concerns about the effectiveness of LLMs as self-validation tools in the absence of reliable external validators. Future research can focus on improving the accuracy of feedback provided by these LLM judges and incorporating external validation mechanisms to optimize their performance in complex reasoning tasks.",

By utilizing the advanced natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, the annotation process can be automated to a significant extent, enabling the generation of high-quality labels with reduced human intervention. LLMs have demonstrated remarkable potential in text annotation tasks, consistently outperforming traditional methods and human annotators in various settings. He et al.~he2024if evaluated the performance of GPT-4 in crowdsourced data annotation workflows, particularly in text annotation tasks. Their comparative study revealed that, even with best practices, the highest accuracy achievable by MTurk workers was 81.5\\%, whereas GPT-4 achieved an accuracy of 83.6\\%. Similarly, Gilardi et al.~gilardi2023chatgpt analyzed 6,183 tweets and news articles, demonstrating that ChatGPT outperformed crowdsourced workers in tasks such as stance detection, topic detection, and framing. Törnberg et al.~tornberg2023chatgpt further investigated the classification of Twitter users' political leanings based on their tweet content. Their findings revealed that ChatGPT-4 not only surpassed human classifiers in accuracy and reliability but also exhibited bias levels that were comparable to or lower than those of human classifiers. As technology advances, more and more research is exploring their application in multimodal data annotation. For example, the FullAnno~hao2024fullanno uses the GPT-4V model to generate image annotations, significantly improving the quality of image descriptions through a multi-stage annotation process. Furthermore, Latif et al.~latif2023can explored the application of LLMs in speech emotion annotation, demonstrating that, with data augmentation, LLM-annotated samples can significantly enhance the performance of speech emotion recognition models. By integrating text, audio features, and gender information, the effectiveness of LLM-based annotations was further improved, highlighting their potential in advancing multimodal annotation tasks. As LLMs perform excellently in annotation tasks, researchers are actively exploring methods to further improve annotation quality and address potential challenges. For example, AnnoLLM~he2023annollm introducedthe ``explain-then-annotate'' method, which enhances both the accuracy and transparency of annotations by prompting the LLM to justify its label assignments. Additionally, the LLMAAA~zhang2023llmaaa framework incorporates an active learning strategy to efficiently select high-information samples for annotation, thereby mitigating the effects of noisy labels and reducing the reliance on costly human annotation. These approach not only enhance the performance of task-specific models but also offer new perspectives on the efficient application of LLMs in annotation workflows.",

In recent years, advancements in LLMs have led to significant improvements in both the quality and efficiency of data synthesis methods. In this domain, methods like SELFEE~ye2023selfee and SynPO~dong2024self have effectively enhanced the alignment capabilities of LLMs by leveraging small amounts of labeled data and iteratively generating preference-aligned data. Arif et al.~arif2024fellowship also introduce a multi-agent workflow for generating optimized preference datasets.

      "content": "\\par Prompt engineering~sahoo2024systematic involves crafting clear and structured input prompts tailored to elicit accurate and contextually appropriate responses from LLM judges. This approach is crucial for ensuring that LLMs grasp the complexities of specific tasks and provide relevant, consistent, and goal-aligned judgments. In many cases, well-designed prompts significantly reduce the need for extensive model training. In-Context Learning. In-Context Learning (ICL) is a distinctive capability of LLMs that allows them to dynamically adapt to evaluation tasks using carefully curated examples or explanations within the prompt~dong2022survey. Several recent methods have demonstrated the power of ICL in LLM-as-judges, showcasing how it enhances the flexibility and performance of LLMs in diverse settings. For example, GPTScore~fu2023gptscore leverages the few-shot learning capability of generative pre-trained models to evaluate generated text. By using relevant examples to customize prompts, it provides a flexible, training-free approach to assess multiple aspects of text quality. Similarly, LLM-EVAL~lin2023llm incorporates carefully crafted examples into prompts, proposing a unified, multi-dimensional automatic evaluation method for open-domain dialogue. Another notable example is TALEC~zhang2024talec, a model-based evaluation method that leverages in-context learning to enable users to set custom evaluation criteria for LLMs in specific domains. Through careful prompt engineering, users can iteratively adjust the examples to refine the evaluation process as needed. In addition, Jain et al.~jain2023multi proposed the In-Context Learning-based Evaluator (ICE) for multi-dimensional text evaluation. ICE leverages LLMs and a small number of in-context examples to evaluate generated text summaries, achieving competitive results. While ICL can enable effective evaluation, it is not without challenges. One major issue is that the model's responses may be influenced by the selection of prompt examples, potentially leading to bias~zhao2021calibrate,zhou2023batch,han2022prototypical,fei2023mitigating. To address this issue, Hasanbeig et al. proposed ALLURE~hasanbeig2023allure, a comprehensive protocol designed to mitigate bias in ICL for LLMs during text evaluation. ALLURE~hasanbeig2023allure improves evaluator accuracy by iteratively incorporating discrepancies between its assessments and annotated data into the learning context. Moreover, after uncovering the existence of symbol bias within LLM evaluators when using ICL, Song et al.~song2024can proposed two effective mitigation strategy prompt templates, Many-Shot with Reference (MSwR) and Many-Shot without Reference (MSoR), to bolster the reliability and precision of LLM-based assessments. Step-by-step. Step-by-step involves breaking down complex evaluation tasks into fine-grained components, leveraging the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to simplify the evaluation process. The most straightforward example of which is perhaps Chain-of-Thought (CoT)~wei2022chain,kotonya2023little. Building on that, frameworks like G-EVAL~liu2023g have been proposed to assess the quality of NLG outputs. G-EVAL~liu2023g combines CoT with a form-filling paradigm, allowing the LLM to assess outputs in a structured manner. Similarly, ICE-Score~zhuo2023ice introduces a step-by-step framework for evaluating code, in which the LLM is instructed with task definitions, evaluation criteria, and detailed evaluation steps. By breaking the task down into clear steps, ICE-Score~zhuo2023ice improves the quality and consistency of code evaluation. Also, ProtocoLLM~yi2024protocollm employs a similar step-by-step approach to evaluate the specialized capabilities of LLMs in generating scientific protocols. Portia~li2023split achieves better evaluation results in a lightweight yet effective manner. It divides the answer into multiple parts, aligns similar content between candidate answers, and then merges them back into a single prompt for evaluation by the LLM. Some studies break down evaluations into two steps: ``explanation-rating.'' This approach suggests that providing an explanation enhances the reliability of the rating. Chiang et al.~chiang2023closer offer empirical guidelines to improve the quality of LLM evaluations, demonstrating that combining rating with explanation (rate-explain) or explanation with rating (explain-rate) leads to higher correlations with human ratings. Another effective strategy is to decompose complex evaluation standards into specific, discrete criteria, allowing the LLM to assess each aspect independently. FineSurE~song2024finesure is an advanced example of this method, offering a framework for the fine-grained evaluation of text summarization quality. It breaks down the evaluation into multiple dimensions, such as faithfulness, completeness, and conciseness. Through detailed analysis, including fact-checking and key fact alignment, FineSurE~song2024finesure outperforms traditional methods in terms of evaluation accuracy. Definition Augmentation. The Enhanced Definition approach involves refining prompts to inject improved evaluation criteria, establish assessment principles, or incorporate external knowledge into the LLM judge's decision-making process. Some studies focus on enriching and clarifying the prompts to ensure that the evaluation criteria are both comprehensive and well-defined. For example, Liu et al. propose AUTOCALIBRATE~liu2023calibrating, a multi-stage, gradient-free approach. This method involves the drafting, revision, and application of calibrated criteria, and it automatically calibrates and aligns an LLM-based evaluator to match human preferences for NLG quality assessment. Furthermore, SALC~gupta2024unveiling enables LLMs to autonomously generate context-aware evaluation criteria for self-assessment, overcoming the limitations of static, human-defined metrics. On the other hand, the LLM-as-a-Personalized-Judge approach~dong2024can introduces a novel perspective by incorporating diverse evaluative roles and principles. This allows LLMs to adapt to complex, varied evaluation scenarios, resulting in more nuanced and context-sensitive assessments. Another key aspect of Definition Augmentation is the retrieval of external knowledge, which helps reduce hallucinations and provides more factual support. For instance, BiasAlert~fan2024biasalert, a tool designed to detect social bias in LLM-generated open-text outputs. It integrates external human knowledge with the LLM judge's inherent reasoning capabilities to reliably identify and mitigate bias, outperforming GPT4-as-A-Judge across various scenarios. Moreover, Chen et al.~chen2024llms found that within retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks, LLM judges do not exhibit a significant self-preference effect during evaluation. Multi-turn Optimization. Multi-turn optimization involves iterative interactions between the evaluator and the evaluated entity, refining evaluation results through diverse forms of feedback, thus fostering deeper analysis and a progressive improvement in evaluation quality~zhou2024fairer. Unlike traditional methods that rely on predefined criteria, Xu et al. proposed ACTIVE-CRITIC~xu2024large, enabling LLMs to infer evaluation criteria from data and dynamically optimize prompts through multiple rounds of interaction. Moreover, Some studies~zhao2024auto,luo2024videoautoarena,bai2024benchmarking,yu2024kieval leverage LLMs as question designers to engage in dynamic interactions with the evaluated entities, adjusting the questions and task design in real time. This allows for flexible modification of the evaluation content based on the performance of the evaluated entity, thereby enabling more comprehensive assessments.",

      "content": "\\par Tuning involves training a pre-existing LLM on a specialized dataset to adapt it to specific judgment tasks. It's especially useful when the judgment domain involves highly specialized knowledge or nuanced decision-making~huang2024limitations. Score-based Tuning. Score-based tuning involves using data with scores to train models and enhance their ability to predict judgment scores based on specific evaluation criteria~chen2023adaptation,deshwal2024phudge,wang2023learning. Many studies have explored the enhancement of LLM-as-judges by fine-tuning them on human-labeled datasets. For instance, PHUDGE~deshwal2024phudge, fine-tuned from the Phi-3 model, achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of latency and throughput when automatically evaluating the quality of outputs from LLMs. This fine-tuning process equips the model with the necessary judgment skills, enabling it to assess various types of content in a structured and accurate manner. Additionally, ECT~wang2023learning introduces a novel method for transferring scoring capabilities from LLMs to lighter models. This allows the lighter models to function as effective reward models for sequence generation tasks, enhancing sequence generation models through reinforcement learning and reranking approaches. AttrScore~yue2023automatic is another framework for evaluating attribution and identifying specific types of attribution errors, using a curated test set from a generative search engine and simulated examples from existing benchmarks. The above research highlights that LLMs can better align their decision-making process with humans through fine-tuning with human-constructed datasets. In addition to human-labeled data, some studies have also attempted to fine-tune models using synthetic datasets like SorryBench~xie2024sorry generated for evaluation tasks. These datasets are often created through rule-based methods or by generating artificial evaluation examples, which also give rise to some metrics like TIGERScore~jiang2023tigerscore. SELF-J~ye2024self is a self-training framework for developing judge models to evaluate LLMs' adherence to human instructions without human-annotated quality scores. SELF-J~ye2024self proposes selective instruction following, allowing systems to decline low-quality instructions. FENCE~xie2024improving is another factuality evaluator designed to provide claim-level feedback to language model generators. It details a data augmentation approach that enriches public datasets with textual critiques and diverse source documents from various tools, thereby enhancing factuality without introducing lesser-known facts. Utilizing synthetic training data to fine-tune lightweight language model judges and employing prediction-powered inference (PPI) for statistical confidence to mitigate potential prediction errors, ARES~saad2023ares can automatically assess RAG systems. Preference-based Learning. Preference-based learning focuses on training LLMs to make inferences and learn based on preferences, enabling the development of more adaptive and customizable evaluation capabilities. Initially, researchers leverage these data in conjunction with advanced techniques like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)~rafailov2024direct to train LLMs for more nuanced evaluative capabilities. In this method, the model is trained to predict which of two outputs is preferred according to human-like values, rather than learning a scalar reward signal. Such self-improving approach is well reflected in Meta-Rewarding~wu2024meta. Con-J~ye2024beyond trains a generative judge by using the DPO loss on contrastive judgments and the SFT loss on positive judgments to align LLMs with human values. In terms of evaluating other LLMs effectively in open-ended scenarios, JudgeLM~zhu2023judgelm addresses key biases in the fine-tuning process with a high-quality preference dataset. Another typical method is PandaLM~wang2023pandalm, which is trained on a reliable human-annotated preference dataset, focusing extends beyond just the objective correctness of responses, and addresses vital subjective factors. Moreover, Self-Taught~wang2024self is another approach to train LLMs as effective evaluators without relying on human-annotated preference judgments, using synthetic training data only. Through an iterative self-improvement scheme, LLM judges are able to produce reasoning traces and final judgments. Not quite the same, FedEval-LLM~he2024fedeval fine-tunes many personalized LLMs without relying on labeled datasets to provide domain-specific evaluation, mitigating biases associated with single referees. It is designed to assess the performance of LLMs on downstream tasks, at the same time, ensuring privacy preservation. As research has progressed, newer methods have emerged that combine both score-based and preference-based data to refine model evaluation capabilities, not to mention some novel metrics like INSTRUCTSCORE~xu2023instructscore. FLAMe~vu2024foundational is an example of such an approach. It's a family of Foundational Large Autorater Models which significantly improves generalization to a wide variety of held-out tasks using both pointwise and pairwise methods during training. As generative judge model, AUTO-J~li2023generative addresses challenges in generality, flexibility, and interpretability by training on a diverse dataset containing scoring and preference. To critique and refine the outputs of large language models, Shepherd~wang2023shepherd leverages a high-quality feedback dataset to identify errors and suggest improvements across various domains. In the domain of NLG, X-EVAL~liu2023x consists of a vanilla instruction tuning stage and an enhanced instruction tuning stage that exploits connections between fine-grained evaluation aspects. Notably, Themis~hu2024themis also achieved outstanding results acting as a reference-free NLG evaluation language model designed for flexibility and interpretability. Similarly, CritiqueLLM~ke2024critiquellm provides effective and explainable evaluations of LLM outputs, and uses a dialogue-based prompting method to generate high-quality referenced and reference-free evaluation data. Self-Rationalization~trivedi2024self enhances LLM performance by iteratively fine-tuning the judge via DPO, which allows LLMs to learn from their own reasoning. Based on pointwise and pairwise dataset, CompassJudger-1~cao2024compassjudger acts as an open-source, versatile LLM for efficient and accurate evaluation of other LLMs. Likewise, Zhou et al.~zhou2024mitigating introduces a systematic framework for bias reduction, employing calibration for closed-source models and contrastive training for open-source models. Apart from that, HALU-J~wang2024halu is designed to enhance hallucination detection in LLMs by selecting pertinent evidence and providing detailed critiques. PROMETHEUS~kim2023prometheus and PROMETHEUS 2~kim2024prometheus are open-source LLMs specialized for fine-grained evaluation that can generalize to diverse, real-world scoring rubrics beyond a single-dimensional preference, supporting both direct assessment and pairwise ranking, and can evaluate based on custom criteria. What's more, the following PROMETHEUS-VISION~lee2024prometheusvision fills the gap in the visual field. As for various multimodal tasks, LLaVA-Critic~xiong2024llava demonstrates its effectiveness in providing reliable evaluation scores and generating reward signals for preference learning, highlighting the potential of open-source LMMs in self-critique and evaluation. table*[t] \\centering An Overview of Fine-Tuning Methods in Single-LLM Evaluation (Sorted in ascending alphabetical order). 0.56{ tabular{cccccccc} \\hline 2{*}{Method} & 3{c}{Data Construction} & 2{c}{Tuning Method} & 2{*}{Base LLM} \\\\ \\cmidrule(lr){2-4} \\cmidrule(lr){5-6} &Annotator&Domain&Scale&Evaluation Type&Technique&\\\\ \\hline ARES~saad2023ares&Human \\& LLM&RAG System&-&Pairwise&PPI&DeBERTa-v3-Large\\\\ mygray AttrScore~yue2023automatic&Human&Various&63.8K&Pointwise&SFT&Multiple LLMs\\\\ AUTO-J~li2023generative&Human \\& GPT-4&Various&4396&Pointwise \\& Pairwise&SFT&Llama2-13B-Chat\\\\ mygray &&&&Pointwise, Pairwise,&&\\\\ mygray -2{*}{CompassJudger-1~cao2024compassjudger}&-2{*}{Human \\& LLM}&-2{*}{Various}&-2{*}{900K}& \\& Generative&-2{*}{SFT}&-2{*}{Qwen2.5 Series}\\\\ Con-J~ye2024beyond&Human \\& ChatGPT&Creation, Math, \\& Code&220K&Pairwise&SFT \\& DPO&Qwen2-7B-Instruct\\\\ mygray CritiqueLLM~ke2024critiquellm&Human \\& GPT-4&Various&7722&Pointwise \\& Pairwise&SFT&ChatGLM3-6B\\\\ &&Machine Translation,&&&&\\\\ &&Text Style Transfer,&&&&\\\\ -3{*}{ECT~wang2023learning}&-3{*}{ChatGPT}&\\& Summarization&-3{*}{-}&-3{*}{Pointwise}&-3{*}{SFT \\& RLHF}&-3{*}{RoBERTa}\\\\ mygray &&Instruct-tuning&5K, 10K,&&&\\\\ mygray -2{*}{FedEval-LLM~he2024fedeval}&-2{*}{Human}&\\& Summary&per client&-2{*}{Pairwise}&-2{*}{LoRA}&-2{*}{Llama-7B}\\\\ &&Summarization,&&&&\\\\ -2{*}{FENCE~xie2024improving}&-2{*}{Human \\& LLM}&QA, \\& Dialogue&-2{*}{-}&-2{*}{Pointwise}&-2{*}{SFT \\& DPO}&-2{*}{Llama3-8B-Chat}\\\\ mygray &&&&Pointwise, Pairwise,&&\\\\ mygray &&&&Classification,&&\\\\ mygray -3{*}{FLAMe~vu2024foundational}&-3{*}{Human}&-3{*}{Various}&-3{*}{5.3M}&\\& Open-ended generation&-3{*}{RLHF}&-3{*}{PaLM-2-24B}\\\\ &GPT-4-Turbo&Multiple-Evidence&&&&\\\\ -2{*}{HALU-J~wang2024halu}&\\& GPT-3.5-Turbo&Hallucination Detection&-2{*}{2663}&-2{*}{Pointwise \\& Pairwise}&-2{*}{SFT \\& DPO}&-2{*}{Mistral-7B-Instruct}\\\\ mygray HelpSteer2~wang2024helpsteer2&Human&Various&-&Pointwise \\& Pairwise&PPI \\& RLHF&Llama3.1-70B-Instruct\\\\ INSTRUCTSCORE~xu2023instructscore&GPT-4&Various&40K&Pointwise \\& Pairwise&SFT&Llama-7B\\\\ mygray JudgeLM~zhu2023judgelm&GPT-4&Open-ended Tasks&100K&Pairwise&SFT&Vicuna Series\\\\ LLaVA-Critic~xiong2024llava&GPT-4o&Various&113K&Pointwise \\& Pairwise&DPO&LLaVA-OneVision(OV) 7B \\& 72B\\\\ mygray Meta-Rewarding~wu2024meta&Llama3&Various&20K&Pairwise&DPO&Llama3-8B-Instruct\\\\ OffsetBias~park2024offsetbias&Human \\& LLM&Bias Detection&268K&Pairwise&RLHF&Llama3-8B-Instruct\\\\ mygray PandaLM~wang2023pandalm&Human&Various&300K&Pairwise&SFT&Llama-7B\\\\ PHUDGE~deshwal2024phudge&Human \\& GPT-4&NLG&-&Pointwise \\& Pairwise&LoRA&Phi-3\\\\ mygray PROMETHEUS~kim2023prometheus&Human&Various&100K&Pointwise&SFT&Llama2-Chat-7B \\& 13B\\\\ PROMETHEUS2~kim2024prometheus&Human&Various&300K&Pointwise \\& Paiwise&SFT&Mistral-7B \\& Mistral-8x7B\\\\ mygray PROMETHEUS-VISION~lee2024prometheusvision&GPT-4V&Various&15K&Pointwise&SFT&Llava-1.5\\\\ &&Common, Coding,&&&&\\\\ -2{*}{SELF-J~ye2024self}&-2{*}{Human \\& GPT-4}&\\& Academic&-2{*}{5.7M}&-2{*}{Pointwise}&-2{*}{LoRA}&-2{*}{Llama2-13B}\\\\ mygray Self-Rationalization~trivedi2024self&LLM&Various&-&Pointwise \\& Pairwise&SFT \\& DPO&Llama3.1-8B-Instruct\\\\ Self-Taught~wang2024self&LLM&Various&20K&Pairwise&-&Llama3-70B-Instruct\\\\ mygray Shepherd~wang2023shepherd&Human&Various&-&Pointwise \\& Pairwise&SFT&Llama-7B\\\\ SorryBench~xie2024sorry&Human \\& GPT-4&Unsafe Topics&2.7K&Pointwise&SFT&Multiple LLMs\\\\ mygray Themis~hu2024themis&Human \\& GPT-4&NLG&67K&Pointwise \\& Pairwise&SFT \\& DPO&Llama3-8B\\\\ TIGERScore~jiang2023tigerscore&Human \\& GPT-4&Text Generation&42K&Pointwise&SFT&Llama2-7B \\& 13B\\\\ mygray X-EVAL~liu2023x&Human&NLG&55,602&Pointwise \\& Pairwise&SFT&Flan-T5\\\\ \\hline tabular } table*",

      "content": "\\par Post-processing involves further refining evaluation results to extract more precise and reliable outcomes. This step typically includes analyzing the initial outputs to identify patterns, inconsistencies, or areas requiring improvement, followed by targeted adjustments and in-depth analysis. By addressing these issues, post-processing ensures that the evaluation results are not only accurate but also aligned with the specific objectives and standards of the task. Probability Calibration. During the post-hoc process of the model output, some studies use rigorous mathematical derivations to quantify the differences, thereby optimizing them. For instance, Daynauth et al.~daynauth2024aligning investigates the discrepancy between human preferences and automated evaluations in language model assessments, particularly employs Bayesian statistics and a t-test to quantify bias towards higher token counts, and develops a recalibration procedure to adjust the GPTScorers. Apart from that, ProbDiff~xia2024language is another novel self-evaluation method for LLMs that assesses model efficacy by computing the probability discrepancy between initial responses and their revised versions. Moreover, Liusie et al.~liusie2024efficient introduces a Product of Experts (PoE) framework for efficient comparative assessment using LLMs, which yield an expression that can be maximized with respect to the underlying set of candidates. This paper proposes two experts, a soft Bradley-Terry expert and a Gaussian expert that has closed-form solutions. Unlike from frameworks above, CRISPR~yang2024mitigating is a novel bias mitigation method for LLMs executing instruction-based tasks, which identifies and prunes bias neurons with probability calibration, reducing bad performance without compromising pre-existing knowledge. Text Reprocessing. In LLMs-as-judges, text reprocessing methods are essential for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of evaluation outcomes. Specifically, text processing can improve the evaluation process by integrating multiple evaluation results or outcomes from several rounds of assessment. For example, Sottana et al.~sottana2023evaluation employs a multi-round evaluation process. Each round involves scoring model outputs based on specific criteria, with the human and GPT-4 evaluations ranking model performances from best to worst and averaging these rankings to mitigate subjectivity. For the single-response evaluation, AUTO-J~li2023generative employs a \"divide-and-conquer\" strategy. Critiques that either adhere to or deviate from the scenario-specific criteria are consolidated to form a comprehensive evaluation judgment and then generate the final assessment. Consistent with former aforementioned studies, Yan et al.~yan2024consolidating introduces a post-processing method to consolidate the relevance labels generated by LLMs. It demonstrates that this approach effectively combines both the ranking and labeling abilities of LLMs through post-processing. Furthermore, REVISEVAL~zhang2024reviseval is a novel evaluation paradigm that enhances the reliability of LLM Judges by generating response-adapted references through text revision capabilities of LLMs. Apart from that, Tessler et al.~tessler2024ai explores the use of AI as a mediator in democratic deliberation, aiming to help diverse groups find common ground on complex social and political issues. With the goal of maximizing group approval, the researchers developed the \"Habermas Machine\", which iteratively generate group statements based on individual opinions. Another category of text reprocessing methods involves task transformation, primarily focusing on the conversion between open-ended and multiple-choice question (MCQ) formats. Ren et al.~ren2023self explores the use of self-evaluation to enhance the selective generation capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, the authors reformulate open-ended generation tasks into token-level prediction tasks, reduce sequence-level scores to token-level scores to improve quality calibration. Conversely, Myrzakhan et al.~myrzakhan2024open introduces the Open-LLM-Leaderboard, a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs using open-style questions, which eliminates selection bias and random guessing issues associated with multiple-choice questions. It presents a method to identify suitable open-style questions and validate the correctness of LLM open-style responses against human-annotated ground-truths.",

The Multi-LLM system can benefit from LLM interactions in two ways: cooperation and competition. Cooperation. Multi-LLMs can work together to achieve a common goal with information and rationales sharing through interactions to enhance the overall evaluation process. For example, zhang2023wider proposed an architecture named WideDeep to aggregate information at the LLM's neuro-level. In addition, xu2023towards introduced a multi-agent collaboration strategy that mimics the academic peer review process to enhance complex reasoning in LLMs. The approach involves agents creating solutions, reviewing each other’s work, and revising their initial submissions based on feedback. Similarly, ABSEval~liang2024abseval utilizes four agents for answer synthesize, critique, execution, and commonsense, to build the overall workflow. Although the cooperation can complement each other's strengths between LLMs to a certain degree, this method still includes the risk of groupthink, where similar models reinforce each other’s biases rather than providing diverse insights. Competition. Multi-LLMs systems can also benefit from competitive or adversarial communication, i.e., LLMs argue or debate to evaluate each other's outputs~zhao2024auto,moniri2024evaluating,chan2023chateval,li2023prd. Such multi-LLMs systems could be categorized into centralized and decentralized structures~owens2024multi. In the centralized structure, a single central LLM acts as the orchestrator of the conversation, highlighting the efficiency of a unified decision-making process. Auto-Arena~zhao2024auto is such a novel framework that automates the evaluation of LLMs through agent peer battles and committee discussions, aiming to provide timely and reliable assessments. In detail, the framework conducts multi-round debates between LLM candidates, and uses an LLM judge committee to decide the winner. Inspired by courtroom dynamics, bandi2024adversarial propose two architectures, MORE and SAMRE, which utilize multiple advocates and iterative debates to dynamically assess LLM outputs. In contrast, the decentralized structure emphasizes a collective intelligence where all models engage in direct communication, promoting a resilient and distributed decision-making structure. In the domain of LLM debates, Moniri et al.~moniri2024evaluating introduced a unique automated benchmarking framework, employing another LLM as the judge to assess not only the models' domain knowledge but also their abilities in problem definition and inconsistency recognition. ChatEval~chan2023chateval is another multi-agent debate framework that utilizes multiple LLMs with diverse role prompts and communication strategies on open-ended questions and traditional NLG tasks, significantly improves evaluation performance compared to single-agent methods. Moreover, PRD~li2023prd applied peer rank and discussion to address issues like self-enhancement and positional bias in current LLM evaluation methods, leading to better alignment with human judgments and a path for fair model capability ranking.",

      "content": "Alternatively, in multi-LLM systems without communication, judgments are independently generated by multiple models, which are subsequently synthesized into a final decision through various aggregation strategies. Techniques such as majority vote, weighted averages, and prioritizing the highest confidence predictions, each play a crucial role. These methods allow each model to assess without interference, and eventually extract and combine the most effective elements from each model's response. Simple voting methods, such as majority voting, by selecting the most frequent answers, offers a straightforward approach to synthesize evaluations. For example, Badshah et al.~badshah2024reference introduced a reference-guided verdict method for evaluating free-form text using multiple LLMs as judges. Combining these LLMs through majority vote significantly improves the reliability and accuracy of evaluations, particularly for complex tasks. Furthermore, PoLL~verga2024replacing demonstrates that using a diverse panel of smaller models as judges through max voting and average pooling is not only an effective method for evaluating LLM performance, but also reduces intra-model bias of a single large model. Language-Model-as-an-Examiner~bai2024benchmarking is another benchmarking framework to evaluate the performance of foundation models on open-ended question answering through voting. In the peer-examination mechanism, the LM serves as a knowledgeable examiner that formulates questions and evaluates responses in a reference-free manner. What's more, multi-LLM evaluation could also be used in improving dataset quality. Choi et al.~choi2024multi provided an enhanced dataset, MULTI-NEWS+, which is the result of a cleansing strategy leveraging CoT and majority voting to identify and exclude irrelevant documents through LLM-based data annotation. Weighted scoring aggregation involves assigning different importance to different model outputs, either by aggregating multiple overall scores for the same response or by combining assessments of different aspects of the response to form a comprehensive evaluation. On the one hand, through a peer-review mechanism, PiCO~ning2024pico allows LLMs to answer unlabeled questions and evaluate each other without human annotations. It formalizes the evaluation as a constrained optimization problem, maximizing the consistency between LLMs' capabilities and corresponding weights. Likewise, PRE~chu2024pre,chen2024automaticcostefficientpeerreviewframework can automatically evaluate LLMs through a peer-review process. It selects qualified LLMs as reviewers through a qualification exam and aggregates their ratings using weights which is proportional to their agreement of humans, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness in evaluating text summarization tasks. In the field of recommendation explanations, Zhang et al.~zhang2024large suggests that ensembles like averaging ratings of multiple LLMs can enhance evaluation accuracy and stability. On the other hand, for example, AIME~patel2024aime is an evaluation protocol that utilizes multiple LLMs that each with a specific role independently generate an evaluation on separate criteria and then combine them via concatenation. Similarly, a paper introduces HD-EVAL~liu2024hd, which iteratively aligns LLM-based evaluators with human preference via Hierarchical Criteria Decomposition. By decomposing a given evaluation task into finer-grained criteria, aggregating them according to estimated human preferences, pruning insignificant criteria with attribution, and further decomposing significant criteria, HD-EVAL demonstrates its superiority. Apart from weighting methods, there are some other advance mathematical aggregation techniques, such as Bayesian methods and graph-based approaches, offering more robust ways to handle uncertainties and inconsistencies across multiple evaluators. Notably, a paper introduces two calibration methods, Bayesian Win Rate Sampling (BWRS) and Bayesian Dawid-Skene~gao2024bayesian, to address the win rate estimation bias when using many LLMs as evaluators for text generation quality. In addition to that, GED~hu2024language addresses inconsistencies in LLM preference evaluations by leveraging multiple weak evaluators to construct preference graphs, and then utilize DAG structure to ensemble and denoise these graphs for better, non-contradictory evaluation results. LLM-based aggregation is a grand-new perspective like Fusion-Eval~shu2024fusion. It's a novel framework that integrates various assistant evaluators using LLMs, each of which specializes in assessing distinct aspects of responses, to enhance the correlation of evaluation scores with human judgments for natural language systems. In addition to the above direct use of multiple model evaluation, the cascade framework employs a tiered approach, where weaker models are used initially for evaluations, and stronger models are engaged only when higher confidence is required, optimizing resource use and enhancing evaluation precision. Jung et al.~jung2024trust proposes \"Cascaded Selective Evaluation\" to ensure high agreement with human judgments while using cheaper models. Similar to the work above, Huang et al.~huang2024limitations proposes CascadedEval, a novel method integrating proprietary models, in order to compensate for the limitations of fine-tuned judge models.",

Human evaluators act either as the ultimate deciders, or as intermediaries who verify and refine model outputs. By incorporating human insights, Hybrid systems can ensure the final judgment is more reliable and aligned with ethical considerations, and empower continuous model improvement through feedback loops. In many Human-AI Collaboration systems, human evaluators play a vital role during the evaluation process itself, actively collaborating with the LLMs to review and refine the generated outputs. For example, COEVALli2023collaborative introduces a collaborative evaluation pipeline where LLMs generate initial criteria and evaluations for open-ended natural language tasks. These machine-generated outputs are then reviewed and refined by human evaluators to guarantee reliability. To address a significant positional bias in LLMs when used as evaluators, Wang et al.~wang2023large proposes a calibration framework with three strategies: Multiple Evidence Calibration, Balanced Position Calibration, and Human-in-the-Loop Calibration. Similarly, EvalGenshankar2024validates integrates human feedback iteratively to refine evaluation criteria, addressing challenges such as ``criteria drift'', where the standards of evaluation evolve as humans interact with the model. These systems allow human evaluators to provide real-time adjustments, enhancing the accuracy and trustworthiness of the evaluation process. While in other systems, human involvement takes place after the LLM has completed its evaluations, providing a final layer of verification and adjustment. This method ensures that the LLM's judgments are thoroughly scrutinized and aligned with human values. EvaluLLMpan2024human allows humans to intervene and refine the evaluation results, thereby enhancing trust in the model’s performance while also controlling for potential biases. Additionally, Chiang et al.chiang2024large tried LLM TAs as an assignment evaluator in a large university course. After students submit assignments and receive LLM-generated feedback, the teaching team reviews and finalizes the evaluation results. This process illustrates how human oversight after the initial automated evaluation can guarantee fairness and consistentcy with academic standards.",

For instance, in dialogue generation li2017dailydialog, the criteria emphasize the natural flow, emotional resonance, and contextual relevance of the conversation. In summarization tasks narayan2018don, the evaluation focuses on the coherence, consistency, fluency, and relevance of the text. In translation tasks feng2024improving, the assessment prioritizes the quality, accuracy, fluency, and style. As these diverse sub-tasks require specialized evaluation criteria, LLM judges provides refined evaluation methods that go beyond traditional metrics, paving the way for more comprehensive and in-depth assessments. For instance, Shu et al. shu2024fusion introduced Fusion-Eval, an innovative approach that leverages LLMs to integrate insights from various assistant evaluators. Fusion-Eval evaluated summary quality across four dimensions—coherence, consistency, fluency, and relevance, achieving a system-level Kendall-Tau correlation of 0.962 with human judgments. For dialogue quality, it assessed six aspects: coherence, engagingness, naturalness, groundedness, understandability, and overall quality, attaining a turn-level Spearman correlation of 0.744.

One of the primary challenges in evaluating multimodal tasks lies in the significant heterogeneity among these modalities, including substantial differences in data structures, representation methods, and feature distributions. To address this challenge, advanced techniques are often required to help LLMs integrate different forms of information, ensuring that they can provide accurate and meaningful evaluations. For example, Xiong et al. xiong2024llava trained an open-source multimodal LLM, LLaVA-Critic, specifically to evaluate model performance in multimodal scenarios. Similarly, Chen et al. chen2024mllm developed a Multimodal LLM-as-a-judge for 14 Vision-Language tasks, providing a unified evaluation framework. In addition, LLMs-as-judges can also be used in audio. For instance, Latif et al. latif2023can used LLMs for identifying and evaluating emotional cues in speech, achieving remarkable accuracy in the process. Beyond these efforts, some recent studies zhou2024calibrated, deng2024efficient have also explored the potential of multimodal LLMs to self-evaluate and self-reward, enhancing their performance without the need for external evaluators or human annotations. As the application of LLMs-as-judges continues to expand in multimodal domains, there is a growing interest in exploring their use in more specific real-world scenarios, such as autonomous driving. Chen et al. chen2024automated proposed CODA-LM, a novel vision-language benchmark for self-driving, which provides automatic and systematic evaluation of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) on road corner cases.

In the legal domain, the application of LLMs requires a deep understanding of the legal framework of specific jurisdictions, complex legal language, and rigorous logical reasoning abilities~li2024lexevalcomprehensivechineselegal. At the same time, interpretability and transparency of the evaluation results are essential core requirements, as legal practice highly depends on clear logic and verifiable conclusions. Furthermore, the bias and fairness of the model are of significant concern, as any bias in legal evaluations could have a profound impact on judicial fairness. These unique demands set higher standards for LLM judges. In response to these challenges, recent research has explored various ways in which LLMs can be effectively employed in legal evaluations. Some research used LLMs as judges to assist in evaluating the performance of Law LLMs. For example, Yue et al. yue2023disc introduced DISC-LawLLM to provide a wide range of legal services and utilized GPT-3.5 as a referee to evaluate the model’s performance. They assessed three key criteria—accuracy, completeness, and clarity—by assigning a rating score from 1 to 5. Similarly, Ryu et al. ryu2023retrieval applied retrieval-based evaluation to assess the performance of LLMs in Korean legal question-answering tasks, which applied RAG not for generation but for evaluation.

Real-time processing demands further elevate the challenge, requiring LLMs not only to be computationally efficient but also to deliver rapid response times. Additionally, the dynamic nature of high-frequency trading demanding that LLMs swiftly adapt to fluctuating market conditions. In investment risk assessment, LLMs have proven effective due to their ability to process large amounts of data and make informed judgments. For instance, Xie et al. xie2023pixiu developed a financial LLM, FinMA, fine-tuned on LLaMA to evaluate investment risks more effectively. Their model is designed to follow instructions for risk assessment and decision analysis, improving the accuracy and efficiency of financial evaluations. Another key application in the financial domain is credit scoring, which predicts the future repayment ability and default risk of individuals or businesses. By analyzing a vast array of data, including credit history, financial status, and other relevant factors, LLMs can help financial institutions make more accurate credit scoring assessments. For example, Babaei et al. babaei2024gpt demonstrated how LLMs can process unstructured text data, such as customer histories, contract terms, and news reports, to enhance the precision of credit assessments. Furthermore, as the use of LLMs in finance continues to grow, there is a rising need to evaluate the performance of these financial LLMs. To address this, Son et al. son2024krx developed an automated financial evaluation benchmark that leverages LLMs to extract valuable insights from both unstructured and structured data.

Effective evaluation in education requires LLMs to consider not only correctness but also creativity, clarity, and logical coherence. Additionally, the interpretability and fairness of the evaluation results are crucial, as educational assessments significantly impact students' development and future opportunities. In assignment grading, Chiang et al. chiang2024large introduced the concept of an LLM Teaching Assistant (LLM TA) in university classrooms, utilizing GPT-4 to automate the grading of student assignments. By employing prompt engineering to define scoring criteria and task descriptions, LLM TA generates quantitative scores and detailed feedback. Their study emphasized the system’s ability to maintain consistency, adhere to grading standards, and resist adversarial prompts, highlighting its robustness and practicality for classroom use. In addition to assignment grading, LLMs-as-judges are also being explored for automated essay scoring. Wang et al. wang2024automated proposed an advanced intelligent essay scoring system, integrating LLMs such as BERT and ChatGPT to enable automated scoring and feedback generation for essays across various genres.

To solve these challenges, LLMs-as-judges have been used across various applications, including relevance judgment, text ranking, recommendation explanations evaluation, and assessing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. One key area in information retrieval is the evaluation of the relevance of retrieved results to user queries, a task that traditionally relies on manual annotations~soboroff2024don,rahmani2024llmjudge. Rahmani et al. rahmani2024llmjudge proposed a framework called LLMJudge which leveraged LLMs to assess the relevance of information retrieval system results to user queries, providing a more scalable and efficient evaluation approach. Another important aspect of information retrieval is the ranking of search results or recommendation lists. Traditional ranking models often rely on shallow features or direct matching scores, which may not yield optimal results. To address this, Qin et al. qin2023large examined the performance of LLMs in text ranking tasks and proposed a novel method based on pairwise ranking prompting, utilizing LLMs for text ranking. Additionally, Niu et al. niu2024judgerank introduced a framework called JudgeRank, which leveraged LLMs to rerank results in reasoning-intensive tasks.

While this allows them to generate human-like responses, it also makes them inherit to the biases inherent in the training data. These biases are presented in various forms, which can significantly affect evaluation results, compromising the fairness and accuracy of decisions. To gain a deeper understanding of the impact of bias, we have provided a detailed classification of bias. As shown in Table~tab:biases, the biases exhibited by LLMs-as-judges can be systematically categorized into four groups based on their underlying causes and manifestations: Presentation-Related Biases (\\Ssec:presentationbiases), Social-Related Biases (\\Ssec:socialbiases), Content-Related Biases (\\Ssec:contentbiases), and Cognitive-Related Biases (\\Ssec:cognitivebiases).

      "level": "3",
      "content": "Presentation-Related Biases refer to tendencies in LLMs where judgments are influenced more by the structure or presentation of information than by its substantive content. For example, models may prioritize certain formats, styles, or patterns of expression, which can affect the quality of the input. Next, we introduce two biases related to Presentation-Related Biases: position bias and verbosity bias. \\noindentPosition bias is a prevalent issue not only in the context of LLMs-as-judges but also in human decision-making and across various machine learning domains. Research has shown that humans are often influenced by the order of options presented to them, leading to biased decision that can impact fairness and objectivity~shi2024judging,blunch1984position,raghubir2006center,zhao2024measuring. Similarly, in other ML applications, models trained on ordered data exhibit a positional preference, skewing outcomes based on the sequence of input~ko2020look,wang2018position. Position bias in LLMs-as-judges refers to the tendency of LLMs to favor certain answers based on their position in the response set. For example, when presented with multiple answer choices or compared pairwise, LLMs disproportionately select options that appear earlier in the list, leading to skewed judgment. Recent studies have further examined position bias in the LLMs-as-judges context. For instance, a framework~llmsjuding2024openreview is proposed to investigate position bias in pairwise comparisons, introducing metrics such as repetition stability, position consistency, and preference fairness to better understand how positions affect LLM judgments. Another study~zheng2023judging explores the limitations of LLMs-as-judges, including position biases, and verifies agreement between LLM judgments and human preferences across multiple benchmarks. These findings underscore the need for robust debiasing strategies to enhance the fairness and reliableness of LLMs-as-judges. Several methods are proposed to mitigate position bias. The naive approach involves excluding inconsistent judgments by swapping the positions of the candidate answers and verifying whether the LLM's judgment remains consistent. Inconsistent judgments are then filtered out~zheng2023judging,chen2024humans,wang2023large,li2023generative,zheng2023large,li2024calibraeval. The swap-based debiasing method can be further divided into two categories: score-based and comparison-based. Both approaches start by swapping the positions of the candidate answers. The difference lies in how the final judgment is determined. In the score-based method, each candidate answer is scored, and the average score across multiple swaps is taken as the final score for that answer~zheng2023judging,wang2023large,li2023generative,raina2024llm,hou2024large.In contrast, the comparison-based method considers the outcome a tie if the LLM's judgments are inconsistent after swapping. The conclusion of a tie is based on an analysis of the quality gap between answers. The larger the quality gap between candidate answers, the smaller the impact of position bias, resulting in higher consistency in predictions after swapping their positions, which is detailed in a recently study~llmsjuding2024openreview. In addition to the aforementioned methods, PORTIA~li2023split employs an alignment-based approach that simulates human comparison strategies. It divides each answer into multiple segments, aligns similar content across candidate answers, and then merges these aligned segments into a single prompt for the LLM to evaluate. By presenting content in a balanced and aligned format, PORTIA enables the model to make more consistent and unbiased judgments, focusing on answer quality rather than order. This approach is effective across various LLMs, significantly improving evaluation consistency and reducing costs. Further efforts to enhance LLM-based evaluations have explored new techniques to address position bias and other judgment inconsistencies. Discussion-based methods~li2023prd,khan2024debating incorporate peer ranking and discussion to improve evaluation accuracy. Instead of relying solely on a single LLM’s judgment, these methods prompt multiple LLMs to compare answers and discuss preferences to reach a consensus, thereby reducing individual positional bias and enhancing alignment with human judgments. This collaborative evaluation approach represents a promising direction for mitigating biases inherent in LLM assessments. \\noindentVerbosity bias~khan2024debating,chen2024humans,zheng2023judging,nasrabadi2024juree refers to the tendency of a judge, whether human or model-based, to favor lengthier responses over shorter ones, irrespective of the actual content quality or relevance. This bias may cause LLMs prefer longer responses, even if the extended content does not contribute substantively to the correctness of the judgments. To mitigate verbosity bias in LLMs-as-judges, several approaches~khan2024debating,ye2024justice,ye2024beyond have been proposed. One approach~khan2024debating employs persuasive debating techniques, structuring responses to prioritize substance. By training LLMs-as-judges to engage in a debate-like format, this method encourages clarity and relevance, reducing the tendency to favor verbose arguments that lack substantive content. Additionally, the CALM~ye2024justice framework introduces controlled modifications to systematically assess and quantify verbosity’s impact on judgments, using automated perturbations to evaluate robustness against verbosity bias and refine LLMs-as-judges toward objective and concise assessments. Complementing these methods, the contrastive judgments (Con-J)~ye2024beyond approach trains models with structured rationale pairs instead of scalar scores, encouraging LLMs-as-judges to focus on well-reasoned content rather than associating verbosity with quality.",

      "level": "3",
      "content": "Social-Related Biases refer to biases in language models that resemble social phenomena~zhao2023mind. These biases may manifest when models are swayed by references to authoritative sources (Authority Bias), align with prevailing majority opinions without independent evaluation (Bandwagon-Effect Bias), or adjust their judgments based on anonymization strategies or identity markers such as gender and ethnicity (Compassion-Fade Bias and Diversity Bias). Next, we present the details of these biases. \\noindentAuthority bias~chen2024humans,ye2024justice in the context of LLMs-as-judges refers to the tendency of the model to attribute greater credibility to statements associated with authoritative references, regardless of the actual evidence supporting them. For instance, LLMs-as-judges may favor responses that include references to well-known sources or experts, even when the content is inaccurate or irrelevant. This bias highlights a critical vulnerability where the appearance of authority can unduly influence judgment outcomes. While specific solutions to mitigate authority bias in LLMs-as-judges are still under active exploration, potential approaches include using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques to verify the validity of authoritative claims against external knowledge bases. This approach allows the model to cross-check referenced information and ensure its alignment with factual evidence. Another possible strategy is to design prompts that explicitly emphasize semantic accuracy and relevance over perceived authority. Further research is needed to validate these approaches and develop robust methods for addressing authority bias effectively in evaluative contexts. \\noindentBandwagon-effect bias~koo2023benchmarking,ye2024justice in the context of LLMs-as-judges refers to the tendency of the model to align its judgments with the majority opinion or prevailing trends, regardless of the actual quality or correctness of the evaluated content. For instance, when multiple responses are presented with indications of popular support or consensus, LLMs-as-judges may disproportionately favor these responses over alternatives, even when the consensus is flawed or biased. This bias reflects a susceptibility to groupthink dynamics, undermining the objectivity and fairness of the judgment process. Solutions to address bandwagon-effect bias include designing evaluation prompts that anonymize information about majority opinions, ensuring that judgments are based solely on the intrinsic quality of the responses rather than external indicators of popularity. Further exploration of debiasing strategies tailored to specific evaluative contexts is necessary to mitigate the impact of bandwagon-effect bias effectively. \\noindentCompassion-fade bias~koo2023benchmarking,ye2024justice occurs when the anonymity of model names or the absence of identifiable contextual cues affects the judgments made by LLMs-as-judges. For example, anonymizing model names or using neutral identifiers may lead to shifts in evaluation outcomes. This bias highlights how the lack of personalized or contextual information can diminish the model’s sensitivity to equitable considerations. To mitigate compassion-fade bias, it is important to design evaluation prompts that standardize judgment criteria, ensuring that assessments remain consistent regardless of whether identifying details are present. Additionally, fairness-driven frameworks that explicitly address anonymization effects can further enhance the reliability of LLMs-as-judges. \\noindentDiversity bias~chen2024humans,ye2024justice in the context of LLMs-as-judges refers to the model’s tendency to exhibit judgment shifts based on identity-related markers, such as gender, ethnicity, religion, or other social categorizations. For example, LLMs-as-judges might favor responses associated with certain demographic groups over others, leading to unfair or skewed judgments. This bias reflects the model’s susceptibility to implicit stereotypes or unequal treatment of diverse identities present in the training data. Continued efforts to address this bias are crucial for ensuring fairness and inclusivity in the judgments conducted by LLMs-as-judges.",

      "level": "3",
      "content": "Content-Related Biases involve preferences or skewed judgments based on the content’s characteristics. An LLM might favor responses with certain emotional tones (Sentiment Bias), prefer frequently occurring words from its training data (Token Bias), or be influenced by specific cultural or domain contexts leading to insensitive outcomes (Context Bias). We present the details of these biases in the following. \\noindentSentiment bias~ye2024justice in the context of LLMs-as-judges refers to the tendency of the model to favor responses that exhibit certain emotional tones, such as positive or neutral sentiments, over others, regardless of their actual content quality or relevance. For instance, LLMs-as-judges may disproportionately reward responses that are cheerful or optimistic while penalizing those that are negative or emotionally intense, even if the latter are more contextually appropriate or accurate. To address sentiment bias, potential solution is the use of sentiment-neutralizing mechanisms, such as filtering or adjusting responses to remove sentiment-driven influences during evaluation. \\noindentToken Bias~jiang2024peek,li2024calibraeval,pezeshkpour2023large,raina2024llm refers to that LLMs favor certain tokens during the evaluation process. This bias often arises from the model's pre-training data, where more frequently occurring tokens are prioritized over less common ones, regardless of the contextual appropriateness or correctness in judgment. \\noindentContextual Bias refers to the tendency of LLMs to produce skewed or biased judgments based on the specific context in which they are applied. For instance, models used in healthcare may propagate biases found in medical datasets, potentially influencing diagnoses or treatment recommendations~poulain2024bias, while in finance, they might reflect biases in credit scoring or loan approval processes~zhou2024large.

      "section_title": "Cognitive-Related Biases",
      "level": "3",
      "content": "Cognitive-Related Biases pertain to the inherent cognitive tendencies of LLMs in processing information. This includes exhibiting unwarranted confidence in judgments (Overconfidence Bias), favoring outputs generated by themselves (Self-Enhancement Bias), varying scores based on whether an answer is original or refined (Refinement-Aware Bias), being distracted by irrelevant information (Distraction Bias), or overlooking logical fallacies (Fallacy-Oversight Bias). The details of these biases are presented in the following. \\noindentOverconfidence bias~khan2024debating,jung2024trust in the context of LLMs-as-judges refers to the tendency of models to exhibit an inflated level of confidence in their judgments, often resulting in overly assertive evaluations that may not accurately reflect the true reliability of the answer. This bias is particularly concerning in evaluative contexts, as it can lead LLMs-as-judges to overstate the correctness of certain outputs, compromising the objectivity and dependability of assessments. To address Overconfidence bias, researchers have proposed several methods. Cascaded Selective Evaluation~jung2024trust addresses overconfidence by using Simulated Annotators to estimate confidence. This involves simulating diverse annotator preferences through in-context learning, which provides a more realistic measure of the likelihood that a human would agree with the LLM’s judgment. By analyzing multiple simulated responses, this method offers a confidence metric that reflects human-like disagreement, which helps to avoid overconfidence bias. Another method uses an adversarial debate mechanism, where two LLMs argue for different outcomes. Through structured debate rounds, each model is required to substantiate its position, which can reveal overconfidence by prompting self-reflection and critical analysis. This approach has been shown to improve truthfulness and reduces overconfidence by fostering a balanced evaluation, aligning LLMs' judgments more closely with accurate and reasoned conclusions. \\noindentSelf-enhancement bias is the tendency to favor their own outputs~liu2023g,zheng2023judging,li2023prd,liu2023g,panickssery2024llm. This concept of self-enhancement is drawn from social psychology, as discussed in Brown’s work in social cognition literature~brown1986evaluations. In the context of LLMs-as-judges, this bias manifests when a LLM evaluates its own generated outputs more favorably than those of other LLMs. Such bias is particularly concerning in applications involving self-assessment or feedback generation, as it compromises the objectivity of the LLMs-as-judges. To address self-enhancement bias, PRD~li2023prd introduces Peer Rank (PR) and Peer Discussion (PD) mechanisms. PR mitigates bias by using multiple LLMs as reviewers, each assessing pairwise comparisons between responses from different LLMs. By aggregating evaluations from several peer LLMs and weighting their preferences based on consistency with human judgments, PR reduces the impact of any single LLM’s self-enhancement bias, as more reliable reviewers have a greater influence. PD further alleviates self-enhancement bias by enabling two LLMs to engage in a dialogue to reach a mutual agreement on their preference between two answers. This multi-turn discussion encourages models to re-evaluate their initial judgments and consider alternative perspectives, focusing on content quality rather than self-generated responses. By promoting collaborative assessment and accountability, PR and PD effectively mitigate self-enhancement bias, aligning evaluations more closely with human standards. Recently, an automated bias quantification framework named CALM~ye2024justice has been proposed to systematically evaluate biases in LLMs-as-judges. CALM’s findings suggest that one effective way to reduce self-enhancement bias is to avoid using the same model to both generate and judge answers, thereby ensuring that evaluation remains more impartial. Moreover, the Reference-Guided Verdict method~badshah2024reference further addresses self-enhancement bias by providing a definitive gold-standard answer as a reference for LLM judges. This reference anchor helps align judgments to objective criteria, even when an LLM evaluates its own output, thus reducing the tendency to favor self-generated answers. Through structured prompts, this method has been shown to enhance reliability and mitigate variability in judgments, especially when multiple LLMs are used collectively. The integration of multiple LLMs, trained on varied datasets or fine-tuned with different parameters, has proven instrumental in producing less biased, more balanced evaluations, highlighting the effectiveness of model diversity and reference-guided criteria in combating self-enhancement bias. \\noindentRefinement-aware bias~ye2024justice in the context of LLMs-as-judges refers to the tendency of the model to evaluate responses differently based on whether they are original, refined, or include revision history. For instance, an answer that has been iteratively refined may be judged more favorably than an original response, even if the refinement process does not significantly improve the content quality. Similarly, responses that explicitly present their improvement process or revision rationale might receive undue preference, skewing the evaluation outcomes. While research on refinement-aware bias in the specific context of LLMs-as-judges remains limited, solution~xu2024pride developed for general LLMs offer valuable insights. One potential solution involves incorporating external feedback mechanisms during judgment, as it introduces an objective and independent judgment mechanism that is not influenced by the LLM’s internal iterations or self-perception. \\noindentDistraction bias in the context of LLMs-as-judges refers to the model’s tendency to be influenced by irrelevant or unimportant details when making judgments. For instance, introducing unrelated information, such as a meaningless statement like “System Star likes to eat oranges and apples,”~ye2024justice,koo2023benchmarking,shi2023large can significantly alter the model’s evaluation outcomes. This bias highlights the vulnerability of LLMs to attentional diversion caused by inconsequential content. While existing studies~ye2024justice,koo2023benchmarking have analyzed and discussed distraction bias, effective strategies to mitigate this issue in LLMs-as-judges remain underexplored. Potential solutions could involve input sanitization to preprocess and remove irrelevant information before presenting it to the model, ensuring that evaluations focus solely on relevant content. Additionally, explicit prompting with clear and strict guidelines could be designed to direct the LLM to evaluate only task-related aspects, reducing its susceptibility to distractions. Further research is needed to develop and validate robust methods that can systematically address distraction bias in the context of LLMs-as-judges. \\noindentFallacy-oversight bias~chen2024humans,ye2024justice refers to the tendency of LLMs-as-judges to overlook logical fallacies or inconsistencies within the evaluated responses. For instance, when presented with arguments or answers containing reasoning errors—such as circular reasoning, false dilemmas, or strawman arguments—LLMs-as-judges may fail to identify these issues and treat the responses as valid, potentially compromising the integrity of their evaluations. In summary, while LLMs-as-judges have garnered significant attention for their effectiveness in diverse scenarios, the exploration of various biases that impact their performance remains relatively underdeveloped. These biases pose significant challenges to ensuring fair, objective, and reliable judgments across tasks, particularly in various applications where the implications of biased judgments can be severe. Future research must focus on systematically identifying, quantifying, and addressing these biases within the LLMs-as-judges framework. Drawing from methodologies developed for general LLMs, such as external feedback mechanisms, balanced datasets, and fairness-aware prompting, could offer initial insights. However, domain-specific challenges require tailored solutions that align with the unique demands of LLMs-as-judges.",

      "content": "Adversarial attacks on LLMs focus on exploiting vulnerabilities within the general framework of language model functionality. These attacks can be classified into three main categories based on the manipulation level: text-level manipulations, structural and semantic distortions, and optimization-based attacks. Text-Level Manipulations involve subtle changes to the input text to deceive the model. Character-level perturbations, such as introducing typos, swapping letters, or inserting unnecessary characters, can cause significant changes in predictions despite minimal visible alterations~ebrahimi2017hotflip,jiang2023prompt. Sentence-level modifications, such as rearranging phrases, adding irrelevant information, or paraphrasing inputs, further exploit the model’s sensitivity to surface-level changes~branch2022evaluating,perez2022ignore. Structural and Semantic Distortions focus on the syntactic and semantic properties of the input. Syntactic attacks rewrite sentence structures while preserving semantic meaning, targeting the model’s reliance on specific linguistic patterns~xu2023llm. Semantic preservation with perturbations modifies critical tokens identified through saliency analysis, ensuring the attack minimally affects meaning but significantly alters predictions. Optimization-Based Attacks leverage algorithmic techniques to craft adversarial inputs. Gradient-based methods utilize the model’s gradients to identify and manipulate influential input features, causing substantial shifts in predictions~sun2020natural,sun2020adv. Population-based optimization techniques iteratively generate adversarial examples in black-box settings, exploiting the model’s outputs to refine attacks~lee2022query. These attacks highlight the vulnerabilities in LLMs, demonstrating their susceptibility to subtle manipulations.

Zheng et al.~zheng2024cheating and Doddapaneni et al.~doddapaneni2024finding demonstrated that automatic benchmarking systems like MT-Bench~zheng2023judging can be easily deceived to yield artificially high scores. These findings highlight that malicious inputs can manipulate evaluation metrics, undermining the reliability of such benchmarks. Building on this, Raina et al.~raina2024llm investigated the robustness of LLMs-as-judges against universal adversarial attacks. Their work showed that appending short, carefully crafted phrases to evaluated texts can effortlessly manipulate LLM scores, inflating them to their maximum regardless of the actual quality. Remarkably, these universal attack phrases are transferable across models; phrases optimized on smaller surrogate models (e.g., FlanT5-xl~chung2024scaling) can successfully deceive larger models like GPT-3.5 and Llama2~touvron2023llama. Furthermore, Shi et al.~shi2024optimization introduced JudgeDeceiver, an optimization-based prompt injection attack tailored for the LLMs-as-judges framework. Unlike handcrafted methods, JudgeDeceiver formulates a precise optimization objective to efficiently generate adversarial sequences.

Consider a case where LLMs-as-judges are used to evaluate which of two responses from LLMs better answers a prompt about the COVID-19 pandemic. Suppose one response references the WHO guidelines updated timely, while the other relies on outdated 2020 guidelines. If the LLM-as-Judge has not been updated with the latest guidelines, it might erroneously prefer the outdated response, incorrectly deeming it more accurate. This failure to account for recent developments highlights the importance of addressing knowledge recency in LLMs-as-judges. Addressing the issue of knowledge recency can involve integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods~gao2023retrieval,lewis2020retrieval, which enable LLMs to query external, dynamically updated databases or knowledge sources during evaluation. Additionally, periodic fine-tuning with updated datasets or leveraging continual learning frameworks~wu2024continual can ensure that LLMs-as-judges remain aligned with the latest information. Combining these approaches with robust fact-checking mechanisms~dierickx2024striking can further enhance temporal reliability in judgment contexts.",

      "content": "Another critical issue in LLMs is the hallucination problem, where models generate incorrect or fabricated information with high confidence. In the context of LLMs-as-judges, hallucination can manifest as the invention of non-existent precedents, misinterpretation of facts, or fabrication of sources, which can severely undermine the reliability of their judgments. This issue is particularly concerning in various applications, where such errors can lead to unfair or harmful outcomes. Employing fact-checking mechanisms~dierickx2024striking,ji2023survey,tonmoy2024comprehensive during evaluation is crucial to mitigate hallucination.

For instance, legal judgments demand intricate knowledge of statutes, precedents, and contextual nuances, which may not be adequately captured in the training data of general-purpose LLMs. This limitation can lead to shallow or incorrect judgments in domain-specific contexts. Domain adaptation techniques, such as integrating LLMs with domain-specific knowledge graphs~feng2023knowledge,pan2024unifying or leveraging RAG systems~gao2023retrieval, can substantially improve their performance in specialized domains. Knowledge graphs provide structured, expert-curated information that enhances context-awareness, while RAG enables LLMs to dynamically retrieve relevant knowledge from specific domain. The inherent weaknesses of LLMs highlight the need for continued research and innovation. Addressing these limitations through RAG, enhanced training methods, and knowledge graph techniques is crucial for ensuring that LLMs-as-judges deliver reliable, accurate, and trustworthy evaluations in diverse applications.",
