Here are the specific reasons for assigning this score:\n\n1. **Limited Mention of Datasets:**\n   - The survey does not provide explicit mentions or detailed descriptions of datasets used in the studies reviewed. There is no section dedicated to discussing the datasets, their scale, application scenarios, or labeling methods. This absence is a significant gap because understanding the datasets used is crucial for evaluating the generalizability and robustness of the diffusion models discussed.\n   \n2. **Lack of Detailed Metrics Coverage:**\n   - Similarly, the survey lacks a detailed discussion on evaluation metrics. While the document discusses various advancements and applications of diffusion models, there is no section that systematically covers the metrics used to evaluate these models' performance. Metrics such as image quality measures, user satisfaction scores, or computational efficiency indicators are not adequately addressed.\n\n3. **Absence of Rationality Analysis:**\n   - The survey does not provide an analysis of why particular datasets or metrics were chosen or how they support the research objectives. An evaluation of whether the choices are academically sound and practically meaningful is missing, which diminishes the scholarly utility of the review.\n\n4. **General Coverage Instead of Specifics:**\n   - The survey broadly discusses the capabilities and innovations of diffusion models across various applications, such as virtual try-on and image inpainting, without tying these discussions back to specific datasets or metrics that would support their claims. For instance, sections like \"Applications of Diffusion Models in Image Synthesis\" mention applications but lack accompanying dataset or metric specifics.\n\nIn summary, the paper would benefit significantly from including detailed sections on datasets and evaluation metrics to provide a more comprehensive literature review. This would enhance the scholarly communication value by offering insights into the practical implications and generalizability of the research findings.", "**Score: 4 points**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe survey on diffusion model-based image editing demonstrates a well-organized comparison between different research methods and innovations.
