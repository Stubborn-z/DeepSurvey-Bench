This is a significant gap that affects the practical application of these models. (Section: Challenges)\n\n   - **Local vs. Global Control**: The paper identifies the limitation of current models in achieving global coherence, both in semantic logic and control conditions, pointing to a need for research on global normalization strategies. This gap is important for improving the overall quality and applicability of generative models. (Section: Challenges)\n\n   - **Superficial Knowledge**: Another gap mentioned is the superficial nature of knowledge captured by PLMs, and the challenge of incorporating commonsense and domain-specific knowledge to enhance text generation. This affects the reliability and applicability of generated texts. (Section: Challenges)\n\n   - **Evaluation Methods**: The paper also points out the lack of robust evaluation methods that can adequately assess both the quality of text and the satisfaction of control conditions, which is a fundamental challenge in the field. (Section: Challenges)\n\n2. **Analysis and Impact:**\n   - While the paper does a good job of identifying these gaps, the analysis often lacks depth in explaining the full implications and potential impacts of these challenges. For example, the discussion on catastrophic forgetting could delve deeper into the specific domains affected and potential solutions.\n   \n   - Similarly, the discussion on decoding control could benefit from more detailed exploration of how finer-grained control could revolutionize specific applications or industries.\n\n3. **Future Directions:**\n   - The paper does suggest future directions, like exploring prompt-based learning, integration with classic generative theories, and novel evaluation metrics, which are well-aligned with the identified gaps. However, these suggestions would benefit from a more in-depth exploration of how these directions could specifically address the outlined challenges. (Section: Future Directions)\n\nOverall, while the paper identifies critical research gaps and suggests directions for future work, the analysis could be more detailed, particularly in terms of the potential impact and reasoning behind the importance of these gaps.
