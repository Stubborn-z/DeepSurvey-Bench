Here is a detailed breakdown supporting the 4-point evaluation:\n\n1. **Diversity of Datasets and Metrics**:\n   - The survey mentions various datasets and benchmarks, such as domain-specific benchmarks for legal or medical text generation [2] and multi-attribute benchmarks [1], indicating an effort to cover a range of applications in controllable text generation. This diversity is crucial as it highlights the adaptability and applicability of different datasets across varied contexts.\n   - However, the survey could have included more specific examples of datasets, including their names, scales, and contexts, to provide stronger evidence of breadth in dataset diversity.\n\n2. **Rationality of Datasets and Metrics**:\n   - The survey discusses evaluation metrics such as BERTScore and MoverScore [26], which are beyond traditional metrics like BLEU and ROUGE, to address the limitations inherent in evaluating controllable text generation. These metrics are academically sound and meaningful for capturing semantic similarity and control adherence.\n   - The paper also critiques traditional metrics' inability to capture nuanced aspects of control, a sophisticated consideration indicating an understanding of the field's demands.\n   - Despite these strengths, the survey lacks detailed descriptions of how these metrics are applied in different scenarios or their effectiveness across various datasets. Providing concrete examples or detailed case studies could have strengthened this aspect.\n\n3. **Application and Explanation**:\n   - The survey provides a fair description of the evaluation approaches, such as using classifier-based metrics for style transfer [7] and factual accuracy in domain-specific generation [96], which supports the research objectives. However, it lacks depth in explaining how these metrics are applied and validated within these contexts.\n   - The discussion on emerging metrics like CTRLEval [97], which offers a novel evaluation approach for control generation, indicates forward-thinking in metric application but would benefit from more detailed exploration.\n\nOverall, the survey does well in addressing a variety of datasets and evaluation metrics, providing a generally reasonable rationale for their selection and use. However, it misses the depth and specificity needed for a perfect score. Greater detail on dataset characteristics and specific applications of evaluation metrics could enhance the survey's comprehensiveness and applicability.", "### Score: 5 Points\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe survey provides a systematic, well-structured, and detailed comparison of various methods related to controllable text generation using transformer-based pre-trained language models, which is evident in several sections.
