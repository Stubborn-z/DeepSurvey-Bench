This diminishes the clarity on the diversity of datasets and metrics covered.\n\n2. **Rationality of Datasets and Metrics**:\n   - The paper does touch upon the importance of sophisticated evaluation metrics, such as forgetting index, backward transfer, and forward transfer in section 5.1. This suggests that the choice of metrics is academically sound.\n   - However, the descriptions lack detail about the scale, application scenarios, and specific labeling methods for each dataset mentioned. Furthermore, the rationale behind the choice of certain metrics over others is not fully explored. For instance, sections like 5.2 and 5.3 mention advanced performance metrics and comparative methodologies but do not delve deeply into their practical application or detailed descriptions.\n   - Section 5.1 Comprehensive Benchmarking Protocols and section 5.4 Domain-Specific Evaluation Frameworks mention some frameworks and protocols but do not provide detailed descriptions of datasets' scale and labeling methods.\n\nIn summary, while the paper does include some datasets and metrics relevant to continual learning, there is a lack of detailed descriptions and rational analysis, which is crucial for a comprehensive understanding and proper evaluation within this field.
