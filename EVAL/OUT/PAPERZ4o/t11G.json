Therefore, a score of 5 points is justified.", "**Score: 4 points**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe paper presents a reasonably clear and structured method classification system, which effectively reflects the technological development and evolution within the field of diffusion model-based image editing. Below, I will elaborate on why I assigned this score, citing specific sections and elements of the paper that support this evaluation:\n\n1. **Method Classification Clarity:**\n   - The paper organizes the methods into three principal categories based on learning strategies: training-based approaches, testing-time finetuning approaches, and training and finetuning free approaches (as detailed in the \"Training-Based Approaches,\" \"Testing-Time Finetuning Approaches,\" and \"Training and Finetuning Free Approaches\" sections). This classification is clear and aligns well with the common methodologies used in diffusion models, reflecting different stages of model training and application.\n   - Each category is further subdivided into specific methodologies, such as \"Domain-Specific Editing,\" \"Reference and Attribute Guided Editing,\" and \"Instructional Editing.\" These subcategories help delineate specific techniques and approaches within broader categories, contributing to the clarity of the method classification.\n\n2. **Evolution of Methodology:**\n   - The paper does a commendable job of presenting the evolution of methodologies, particularly in the \"Background\" and \"Scope and Categorization\" sections. It outlines how diffusion models have been influenced by previous neural network frameworks like GANs and how they are advancing with techniques such as CLIP guidance and the integration of multimodal conditions.\n   - There is a systematic presentation of methodological trends, such as the shift from traditional training-heavy models to more efficient and flexible models that can operate with minimal finetuning or even none, reflecting a trend towards more resource-efficient and user-friendly models.\n\n3. **Areas for Improvement:**\n   - While the classification is relatively well-defined, some connections between methods and evolutionary stages could be explained in greater detail. For instance, the paper could better articulate the transition and integration between methods that rely on heavy training and those that incorporate real-time testing adaptations.\n   - Some sections, like \"Pseudo-Target Retrieval Based Editing\" and \"Latent Variable Optimization,\" could benefit from clearer linkage to the broader trends in the field, perhaps by highlighting how they address specific limitations of previous approaches.\n\nOverall, the paper successfully outlines the main categories and evolutionary trends in diffusion model-based image editing, but there is room for improvement in articulating the interconnections and progression between certain methodologies. This results in a score of 4 points, as the classification and evolutionary description are solid but could be enhanced with more detailed connectivity and stage explanation.", "**Score: 4 Points**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe review provides a substantial coverage of datasets and evaluation metrics related to diffusion model-based image editing. Here are the key reasons for assigning a score of 4:\n\n- **Diversity of Datasets and Metrics**: The review introduces a benchmark named EditEval, specifically designed for evaluating diffusion model-based image editing methods. This benchmark includes a dataset of 150 high-quality images, each accompanied by text prompts. It also adopts the LMM Score as a new metric for evaluation, leveraging large multimodal models (LMMs) to assess editing performance across different tasks. This demonstrates a good diversity in datasets and metrics by offering both a novel dataset and a new evaluation metric.\n\n- **Rationality of Datasets and Metrics**: The choice of the dataset appears reasonable and targeted, as it aims to evaluate common editing tasks with high-quality images and detailed prompts generated by GPT-4V. However, while the review describes the benchmark setup and the creation process of the dataset, further details on the scale, application scenario, and specific labeling methods of the dataset could have been provided to achieve a perfect score. \n\n- **Evaluation Metrics**: The introduction of LMM Score represents a significant step forward in addressing the limitations of existing metrics like CLIPScore. LMM Score is articulated well, with the review explaining its basis in advanced visual-language understanding capabilities and its components—editing accuracy, contextual preservation, visual quality, and logical realism. This metric is academically sound and aligns well with practical needs, enhancing the review's score.\n\n- **Comparison with Existing Metrics**: The review also compares LMM Score against other evaluation metrics like CLIPScore, Directional CLIP Similarity, and TIFA Score, demonstrating its relevance and applicability in the context of image editing. This comparison further supports the rationality of the chosen evaluation metric.\n\nOverall, the review covers multiple datasets and evaluation metrics, providing a fairly detailed description of the benchmark and the rationale for the chosen metric. The explanation of LMM Score's framework and its application indicates a thoughtful approach to evaluation. However, the review could further enhance the diversity and rationality by providing more detailed information on the dataset's characteristics and its broader application scenarios.", "### Score: 5 points\n\n### Explanation:\nThe paper titled \"Diffusion Model-Based Image Editing: A Survey\" presents a systematic, well-structured, and detailed comparison of various methods within the domain of diffusion model-based image editing. The review is comprehensive, addressing over 100 methods in a detailed manner, reflecting a deep understanding of the research landscape. Here's why this paper merits a score of 5 points:\n\n1. **Systematic Organization**: The paper categorizes the methods into three principal groups based on their learning strategies: training-based approaches, testing-time finetuning approaches, and training and finetuning free approaches. This categorization is meaningful and provides a clear framework for understanding the different strategies used in image editing with diffusion models.\n\n2. **Detailed Comparison Across Multiple Dimensions**: Within each category, methods are further organized based on specific characteristics such as domain-specific editing, reference and attribute-guided editing, instructional editing, pseudo-target retrieval based editing, etc. This allows the reader to understand the specific focus and applications of different methods.\n\n3. **Advantages and Disadvantages**: The paper systematically discusses the advantages and disadvantages of methods. For example, training-based approaches are noted for their stable training processes and effective modeling of data distribution, leading to reliable performance across various editing scenarios. However, they require substantial training resources. Finetuning approaches allow for more precise and personalized edits, but they may be less efficient due to the need for image-specific adjustments.\n\n4. **Commonalities and Distinctions**: The review identifies commonalities and distinctions among methods, such as the use of CLIP guidance, cycling regularization, projection and interpolation, and classifier guidance in domain-specific editing. It discusses how these techniques are adapted from GAN-based methods for use in diffusion models.\n\n5. **Technical Depth and Grounding**: The paper provides technical grounding by explaining the architectural differences, objectives, and assumptions of various methods. For instance, the paper discusses DDPM Inversion and its limitations in reconstruction performance, inspiring developments like DDPM Inversion, SDE-Drag, LEDITS++, among others.\n\n6. **Objective and Structured Comparison**: The paper avoids superficial listing and instead provides structured comparisons, supported by diagrams, tables, and detailed explanations. These visual aids enhance understanding and provide additional technical insights.\n\nThe sections titled \"Training-Based Approaches\", \"Testing-Time Finetuning Approaches\", and \"Training and Finetuning Free Approaches\" are particularly strong in providing this detailed and structured comparison.
