Here's a breakdown of the rationale behind the score:\n\n1. **Lack of Dataset Coverage**: \n   - The paper does mention various models and frameworks like M3oE, AdaMoE, Skywork-MoE, Megatron-LM, and others, but it lacks detailed descriptions of any specific datasets used to evaluate these models. There's no mention of dataset names, scale, structure, or how they contribute to validating the MoE strategies within large language models. \n   - There are references to multimodal and multilingual models and the challenges associated with them, but again, no specific datasets are identified or described in terms of their role in these contexts.\n\n2. **Insufficient Evaluation Metrics**:\n   - The paper does not provide a comprehensive discussion on the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of MoE models. While it mentions some general performance metrics like accuracy and F1-score in passing (for example, when discussing models like OLMoE), there is no detailed analysis or explanation of why these metrics were chosen and how they relate to the specific objectives of the MoE strategies.\n   - Without a clear enumeration and discussion of metrics, it is difficult to ascertain how well these metrics cover the key dimensions of performance in the field of large language models.\n\n3. **Rationale and Analysis**:\n   - The paper lacks a detailed rationale for the choice of datasets and metrics, which is crucial for understanding the relevance and impact of the findings. There is a need for more explicit connections between the datasets used, the evaluation metrics chosen, and the specific research objectives of integrating MoE strategies.\n\nOverall, the paper would greatly benefit from including specific examples of datasets and metrics, along with detailed explanations of their applicability and importance in evaluating the performance of Mixture of Experts strategies within large language models. Without these details, the coverage of datasets and metrics remains vague and insufficient for a comprehensive understanding of the field.", "**Score: 3 points**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe survey provides an overview of Mixture of Experts (MoE) strategies within large language models, discussing various frameworks and methodologies. While the paper touches on the advantages and disadvantages of different methods and highlights some similarities and differences, the comparison is somewhat fragmented and lacks a systematic structure or sufficient technical depth in contrasting the methods. Here are specific observations supporting this assessment:\n\n1. **Mention of Advantages and Disadvantages**: The paper does discuss some advantages and disadvantages of MoE methods. For instance, it notes the computational efficiency and scalability (Introduction, \"The primary motivation for employing MoE is to enhance computational efficiency and adaptability\"). However, these discussions are not systematically structured across all methods, leading to a somewhat fragmented presentation.\n\n2. **Commonalities and Distinctions**: The survey identifies some commonalities, such as the use of sparse activation and dynamic routing mechanisms (Background and Definitions, \"The Mixture of Experts (MoE) model is a sophisticated neural network architecture that integrates gating networks with expert networks\"). However, the distinctions between different frameworks and methodologies are not consistently or deeply explored. For example, the paper mentions various frameworks like M3oE, AdaMoE, and Skywork-MoE but does not provide a detailed comparative analysis of these models' specific architectures or application scenarios.\n\n3. **Lack of Systematic Comparison**: Although the paper covers multiple MoE implementations and strategies, it does not organize these comparisons across multiple meaningful dimensions like modeling perspective, data dependency, learning strategy, or application scenario. The discussion tends to list methods and their characteristics rather than providing an integrated, systematic comparison. For instance, the sections on \"Advanced MoE Implementations\" and \"Enhancing Performance through Conditional Computation\" list several methods and their contributions but do not effectively juxtapose these methods to highlight their relative strengths and limitations.\n\n4. **Superficial Comparison**: Some comparisons remain at a high level without delving into the technical specifics that would differentiate the methods more clearly. For example, the paper mentions the \"Pre-gated MoE\" and \"Deep Mixture of Experts\" (Mixture of Experts in Large Language Models section) but does not detail how their architectural decisions lead to different performance outcomes or suitability for specific tasks.\n\nOverall, while the paper provides a broad overview of current MoE strategies and mentions some advantages and disadvantages, it lacks a thorough, structured, and technically grounded comparison that would elevate it to a higher score.", "### Score: 3 points\n\n### Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe survey paper presents a broad overview of Mixture of Experts (MoE) strategies within large language models and neural networks, primarily focusing on their impact on computational efficiency and adaptability.
