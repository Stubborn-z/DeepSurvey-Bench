However, it lacks thorough coverage and detailed discussion of specific datasets and evaluation metrics, which are crucial for assessing the scholarly communication value of its review content.\n\n1. **Diversity of Datasets and Metrics**: \n   - The review mentions various applications and some techniques, such as MoE frameworks applied to vision-language models, multimodal applications, and machine translation systems. However, it does not specifically list or detail any datasets used in these domains or in the development of MoE models. The absence of named datasets limits the diversity aspect.\n   - Evaluation metrics are not explicitly addressed in the survey. While the text discusses model performance and efficiency improvements, it lacks an explicit enumeration or description of the metrics used to assess such improvements.\n\n2. **Rationality of Datasets and Metrics**:\n   - The review does not provide a rationale for the choice of any datasets, as it does not mention specific datasets. This omission makes it challenging to assess whether the datasets effectively support the research objectives.\n   - The review discusses improvements in metrics like model performance and scalability but fails to specify metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, or recall, which are typically used in evaluating models' performance. The lack of detailed metric discussion means the evaluation lacks academic soundness and practical significance.\n\n3. **Supporting Parts of the Paper**:\n   - The sections covering case studies and applications, such as those related to machine translation systems and natural language understanding (NLU), discuss applications generally but do not specify datasets or precise metrics (\"In natural language understanding (NLU), MoE techniques have effectively enhanced dialog systems...\").\n   - Similarly, the discussion about \"Challenges in Distributed Computing for MoE\" and \"Optimization of Resource Utilization\" lacks mentions of datasets or evaluation metrics to support these challenges or optimizations.\n\nIn summary, due to the lack of specific datasets and evaluation metrics and their insufficient explanation and analysis, the survey receives a score of 2. The lack of details restricts the depth and applicability of the review, which are essential for a high-quality literature review in academic research.", "**Score: 3 points**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe survey provides a comparison of different methods related to Mixture of Experts (MoE) systems, but the comparison lacks depth and systematic structure in certain areas. Here's a breakdown of the evaluation:\n\n1. **Clarity and Structure:**\n   - The paper attempts to compare various methods, as seen in sections like \"Neural Networks and Model Optimization\" and \"Distributed Computing Frameworks.\" However, the structure of these comparisons is not systematic or well-organized enough to fully articulate the distinctions or advantages of each method relative to others.\n\n2. **Identification of Advantages and Disadvantages:**\n   - Advantages and disadvantages are mentioned, such as in the \"Neural Networks and Model Optimization\" section, which discusses the role of neural networks in enhancing expert activation and computational efficiency. However, these points are not consistently compared across different methods, leading to a somewhat fragmented presentation.\n   - For instance, the mention of techniques like \"FlashAttention\" and \"GQA\" is brief and lacks a deeper comparative analysis with other techniques mentioned.\n\n3. **Commonalities and Distinctions:**\n   - The paper identifies some commonalities, such as the use of sparse expert activation in MoE models, and distinctions, like the different strategies employed in models like DS-MoE or LLaMA-MoE. Yet, these are described more in isolation rather than as part of a cohesive comparative analysis across multiple dimensions.\n   - Differences in architecture or assumptions are not thoroughly explored. For example, while the paper mentions methods like \"sparsely-gated MoE techniques\" and \"Pre-gated MoE systems,\" it does not delve deeply into how these differ in architectural or objective terms from other methods.\n\n4. **Technical Depth:**\n   - There is a lack of technical depth in contrasting the methods. The paper mentions concepts like \"parameter-efficient fine-tuning\" and \"distributed training techniques,\" but does not explore these in a way that highlights their unique advantages or limitations compared to other methods.\n\n5. **Fragmentation:**\n   - The survey often reads like a listing of different techniques and their associated benefits rather than a cohesive comparison. This leads to a somewhat fragmented understanding of how these methods interrelate or differ in their application to MoE and LLMs.\n\nOverall, while the paper provides useful information and mentions various techniques and methods, the comparison lacks the systematic structure and technical depth required for a higher score. It does not fully leverage the opportunity to analyze and compare the methods against each other in detail, which would enrich the reader's understanding of the research landscape.", "## Evaluation Score: 4 points\n\n### Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe survey titled \"A Survey on Mixture of Experts in Large Language Models\" demonstrates a significant effort to provide an analytical overview of the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures within the context of large language models (LLMs), neural networks, model optimization, and distributed computing.
