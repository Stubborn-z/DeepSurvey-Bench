{"name": "G", "paperour": [4, 5, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4], "reason": ["Score: 4/5\n\nExplanation:\n\nResearch Objective Clarity\n- Clear, specific objective: The paper explicitly positions itself as a comprehensive survey of pretrained foundation models (PFMs) across multiple modalities. In Contribution and Organization, it states: “We present a solid and up-to-date review of the development of PFM in NLP, CV, and GL.” It further clarifies scope in Introduction: “We focus on reviewing PFMs for text, image, and graph… Apart from the PFMs for a specific data domain, we also review… speech, video… cross-domain data, and multimodal PFMs.” The listed contributions (three bullet points) delineate concrete aims: (1) a cross-domain synthesis (NLP, CV, GL), (2) coverage of advanced topics (unified PFMs, efficiency/compression, security/privacy), and (3) future challenges/open problems and evaluation resources.\n- Minor issues: The objective is broad and somewhat diffuse (covering many domains and topics without an explicit set of research questions or taxonomy in the Introduction). There is no stated methodology for literature selection (e.g., inclusion criteria, time window), which would sharpen objective boundaries. Formatting artifacts (e.g., “itemize,” “Section~Section”) also detract from clarity.\n\nBackground and Motivation\n- Strong background setting: The Introduction provides a substantial overview of PFMs—what they are, why they matter, and where they originated (“PFMs are regarded as essential… in the era of big data,” “PFMs are built upon the pretraining technique… origins from transfer learning,” references to BERT, GPT-3/ChatGPT, ViT, Graph Transformers). It contextualizes PFMs’ impact and breadth (NLP, CV, GL) and connects to recent trends (RLHF, instruction alignment, chain-of-thought, multimodality).\n- Clear motivation via gap analysis: In Contribution and Organization, the paper contrasts prior surveys (“There are several survey studies… However, existing works did not achieve a comprehensive review of PFMs in different areas… and different aspects such as pretraining tasks, efficiency, efficacy, and privacy.”) and positions its novelty: cross-domain, multi-aspect coverage with evolution tracking and challenges.\n- Minor issues: While motivation is strong, the Introduction does not articulate a guiding analytical framework or explicit research questions; this limits how sharply the background funnels into the stated objective.\n\nPractical Significance and Guidance Value\n- Clear practical value: The paper claims to synthesize models and methods across domains and to provide forward-looking guidance. It promises to discuss “model efficiency and compression, security and privacy” and to “discuss the main challenges and opportunities for future research… which guides a new generation of collaborative and interactive intelligence based on PFMs.” It also notes that evaluation metrics and datasets are summarized in an Appendix—useful for practitioners.\n- Organization that aids usability: The Contribution and Organization section outlines a structured roadmap (basic components; PFMs in NLP/CV/GL; advanced PFMs; efficiency/compression; security/privacy; challenges; conclusion), which enhances the review’s guidance value.\n- Limitations: The absence of an explicit abstract in the provided text reduces initial accessibility and objective signaling. Additionally, lack of an upfront methodology (how works were selected/synthesized) slightly weakens practical guidance for reproducibility and scope interpretation.\n\nOverall, the Introduction clearly sets the scene, identifies a gap, and states concrete survey goals with practical relevance, but the lack of an abstract and an explicit methodological framing keeps it from the top score.", "5\n\nExplanation:\n- Method classification clarity:\n  - The survey organizes methods along clear, orthogonal axes for each modality and first introduces cross-cutting primitives that unify the taxonomy:\n    - In “Basic Components,” the paper lays a field-agnostic backbone: “Transformer for PFMs,” “Learning Mechanisms for PFMs” (supervised, semi/weakly/self-supervised, RL), and “Pretraining Tasks for PFMs” separately for NLP, CV, and GL. This establishes a shared classification scaffold before modality-specific details, making later sections coherent.\n    - For NLP (“PFMs for Natural Language Processing”), the authors present a crisp taxonomy of “Word Representations Methods” into three branches—autoregressive LM, contextual LM, and permuted LM—explicitly stating the two key dimensions (prediction direction and contextual information). This is followed by orthogonal design axes: “Model Architecture Designing Methods” (encoder/decoder/encoder–decoder with BART bridging BERT and GPT), “Masking Designing Methods” (SpanBERT, MASS, UniLM), “Boosting Methods” (by performance, multi-task learning, domain-specialization), and “Instruction-Aligning Methods” (SFT, RLHF, CoT). Each category is well demarcated and internally consistent.\n    - For CV (“PFMs for Computer Vision”), the classification maps cleanly to historical lines of work and learning signals: “Learning by Specific Pretext Task,” “Learning by Frame Order,” “Learning by Generation,” “Learning by Reconstruction,” “Learning by Memory Bank,” “Learning by Sharing” (with Soft vs Hard sharing for MoCo/BYOL vs SimCLR/SimSiam), and “Learning by Clustering.” This mirrors the field’s move from handcrafted pretexts to contrastive paradigms to masked image modeling, presented in distinct, comprehensible bins.\n    - For GL (“PFMs for Graph Learning”), a parallel taxonomy is given: “Learning by Graph Information Completion,” “Learning by Graph Consistency Analysis” (Context/Self/Cross-Scale), “Learning by Graph Property Prediction” (Property Regression vs Property Classification), “Learning by Masked Autoencoder,” and “Other Learning Strategies.” The sub-division (e.g., GCA into three consistency types; GPP into regression/classification) shows careful, fine-grained categorization aligned with graph-specific signals.\n  - The survey supplements these classifications with comprehensive summary tables listing years, venues, methods, and tasks for NLP, CV, and GL, which helps anchor categories to concrete exemplars and periods.\n\n- Evolution of methodology:\n  - The evolution is systematically presented within and across modalities, tying categories to chronological and conceptual shifts:\n    - NLP evolution: The text explicitly traces a trajectory from static word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe) to contextual LMs (ELMo, BERT/RoBERTa), to permuted LMs (XLNet/MPNet) addressing MLM train–test mismatch (“Permuted Language Model”), and then to instruction alignment (SFT, RLHF) and CoT (“Instruction-Aligning Methods”), culminating in GPT‑4. The “Model Architecture Designing Methods” section positions BART as a bridging seq2seq denoising autoencoder unifying encoder/decoder paradigms, reinforcing the evolutionary narrative.\n    - CV evolution: The authors move from early pretext-based SSL (“Learning by Specific Pretext Task”: inpainting, colorization, jigsaw, rotation) to temporal sequence signals (“Learning by Frame Order”: CPC), to adversarial/generative encoders (“Learning by Generation”: BiGAN/BigBiGAN), to masked reconstruction with ViT/MAE/SimMIM (“Learning by Reconstruction”), to instance discrimination with memory banks (“Learning by Memory Bank”: NPID, PIRL), to contrastive two-stream frameworks and parameter sharing strategies (“Learning by Sharing”: MoCo→MoCo v2, BYOL; hard sharing SimCLR/SimSiam; SwAV/SEER), and then to clustering-augmented contrastive methods (“Learning by Clustering”: DeepCluster, SwAV, PCL). The ordering and narration reflect the field’s actual methodological progression and show why each step emerged (e.g., from reliance on pretexts to scalable contrastive learning to masked modeling with transformers).\n    - GL evolution: The paper maps NLP/CV self-supervision ideas into graph contexts, starting with completion-style masking (“Graph Information Completion”), then consistency-based contrastive learning at different scales (“Graph Consistency Analysis” with Context/Self/Cross-Scale consistency), then property-driven auxiliary supervision (“Graph Property Prediction” with PR/PC), and finally the adoption of masked autoencoders to graph data (MGAE/GraphMAE/MaskGAE/HGMAE). This mirrors the cross-pollination of ideas and highlights modality-specific adaptations.\n    - Cross-modal/unification trends: “PFMs for Other Data Modality” and “SOTA Unified PFMs” make the convergence trend explicit (e.g., shared Transformers, masked modeling, scaling, instruction/RL alignment, and multimodality), and categorize unified PFMs by backbone architecture (single-transformer, multi-transformer, comb-transformer), showing a forward-looking evolutionary direction toward unified models (UNITER, Uni-Perceiver, OFA, UNIFIED‑IO, BEiT‑3, FLAVA, UNIMO).\n  - The paper consistently situates methods temporally (years in tables and inline citations) and conceptually (e.g., why permuted LMs address MLM inconsistencies; why MAE raises masking ratios; why momentum encoders improve consistency), which helps reveal the rationale behind transitions.\n\n- Connections and trends:\n  - The survey explicitly draws connections between modalities via shared components and learning mechanisms (“Transformer for PFMs,” “Learning Mechanisms for PFMs,” and “Pretraining Tasks for PFMs”), underscoring how ideas propagate (e.g., masked prediction from NLP to CV to GL; contrastive learning across modalities).\n  - It identifies present trends and future directions (e.g., instruction alignment via RLHF/CoT; unified PFMs; efficiency/compression; security/privacy) and closes with “Future Research Challenges and Open Problems,” reinforcing an evolutionary perspective beyond method listings.\n\n- Minor limitations (do not lower the score materially):\n  - While the evolution is clear within each modality, cross-modality timelines could be made even more explicit with a consolidated chronology figure spanning NLP→CV→GL. Nonetheless, the “Basic Components” and unified PFM sections already bridge these lines well.\n  - Some sections (e.g., “Boosting Methods” in NLP) mix multiple concerns (compression, MTL, domain specialization) and could more explicitly tie them to the main chronological arc; however, they are clearly labeled subcategories and do not obscure the primary evolutionary narrative.\n\nOverall, the paper presents a clear, well-structured classification that accurately reflects methodological trajectories in NLP, CV, and GL, and articulates the broader convergence toward unified and instruction-aligned PFMs.", "Score: 2/5\n\nExplanation:\n- Diversity of datasets and metrics:\n  - While the survey spans many modalities (NLP, CV, GL, speech, video, multimodal), it does not substantively cover datasets or evaluation metrics within the provided content. Across the main sections, the paper catalogs models, tasks, and training paradigms, but gives almost no concrete dataset coverage (names, scales, labeling schemes, splits) or metric definitions.\n  - The only explicit promise of dataset/metric coverage is in “Contribution and Organization,” which states: “We also comprehensively present the related evaluation metrics and datasets in Appendix~\\ref{Evaluation_Metrics and~datasets}.” However, the appendix is not included in the provided text, and the body of the paper does not supply those details.\n  - Occasional, incidental mentions appear (e.g., “ImageNet” as a pretraining example in PFMs for CV; GPT-3 “trained with 45 Terabytes of data” in PFMs for NLP; LaMDA “pretrained on 1.56T words of dialog data and web text”), but these are cursory and lack dataset definitions, composition, sources, or annotation methods. In CV, BigBiGAN is said to achieve SOTA “on ImageNet” (Learning by Generation), but there is no elaboration of dataset scale or protocol. These passing references do not constitute dataset coverage.\n\n- Rationality of datasets and metrics:\n  - The review does not discuss evaluation metrics in any of the core sections (no GLUE/SuperGLUE, BLEU/ROUGE, EM/F1 for QA, ImageNet Top-1/Top-5, COCO AP/mAP, mIoU, Recall@K, or graph-learning metrics such as Micro/Macro-F1, AUC, NDCG). For example:\n    - PFMs for NLP: A long model table (“Summary of PFMs in NLP”) lists architectures and tasks but no datasets or metrics. The narrative describes training schemes and tasks but omits how models are evaluated.\n    - PFMs for Computer Vision: The section describes pretext tasks and provides a comprehensive method table (“Summary of the PFMs in CV”) with “Downstream task types” (e.g., classification, detection, segmentation) but no datasets (e.g., ImageNet, COCO, ADE20K) or metrics (Top-1, AP, mIoU).\n    - PFMs for Graph Learning: The table lists pretext tasks and encoders but not datasets (e.g., Cora/Citeseer/PubMed, OGB benchmarks) or metrics.\n  - Even where performance is mentioned qualitatively (e.g., “SAM…routinely achieves strong outcomes…using a zero-shot transfer approach,” PFMs for CV), there is no quantitative metric reporting or explanation of evaluation protocols.\n  - Because the datasets and metrics are neither enumerated nor analyzed, the paper cannot justify the rationality of dataset choices or show that the chosen metrics capture key performance dimensions across modalities.\n\n- Supporting citations to the paper:\n  - “We also comprehensively present the related evaluation metrics and datasets in Appendix~\\ref{Evaluation_Metrics and~datasets}.” (Contribution and Organization). This is the only explicit acknowledgement of datasets/metrics coverage, but the appendix is not provided here.\n  - PFMs for NLP: large model table lacks dataset/metric columns.\n  - PFMs for CV: “We summarize the PFMs proposed in CV in Table~\\ref{tab:pretraining model for image}.” The table and narrative focus on methods and tasks, not datasets/metrics.\n  - PFMs for Graph Learning: “We have summarized the graph-related PFMs in Table~\\ref{tab:pretraining model for graph}.” Again, no datasets/metrics.\n  - Isolated mentions: “trained with 45 Terabytes of data” (GPT-3), “pretrained on 1.56T words” (LaMDA), “SOTA…on ImageNet” (BigBiGAN). These do not constitute comprehensive coverage.\n\nGiven the absence of a substantive Data/Evaluation/Experiments section in the provided text and the lack of concrete dataset and metric descriptions, a score of 2 is warranted. The survey signals intent to cover datasets/metrics in an appendix, but in the material reviewed here, the coverage is minimal and not actionable.", "4\n\nExplanation:\n\nOverall, the survey provides clear and technically grounded comparisons in several key sections, but the comparisons are uneven across the paper and sometimes remain at a high-level or devolve into listings. The strongest comparative analysis appears in the NLP and CV sections where the authors contrast architectures, objectives, and design choices (with implications for advantages/disadvantages), while other modalities and some large tables are more descriptive than comparative.\n\nWhere the paper excels in systematic, multi‑dimensional comparison:\n\n- NLP architectures and objectives (clear contrasts among BERT, GPT, BART):\n  - In “Model Architecture Designing Methods,” the paper explicitly contrasts encoder‑only (BERT), decoder‑only (GPT), and encoder‑decoder (BART) designs and ties these differences to capabilities/limitations:\n    - “BERT uses a bi-directional encoder… However, the document is encoded bidirectionally and missing tokens are predicted independently, which reduces the generation ability.” (advantage in NLU vs disadvantage in generation)\n    - “GPT uses an autoregressive decoder… so it is more suitable for text-generation tasks. However, GPT only uses the former words for prediction, which cannot learn bidirectional interaction information.” (trade-offs in conditioning and context use)\n    - “Different from these models, BART … uses the seq2seq model to rebuild the original text… The addition of a series of noise patterns makes the performance of BART in sequence generation and natural language reasoning tasks significantly improved.” (design innovation and benefit)\n  - In “Masking Designing Methods,” the paper compares masking strategies and training objectives:\n    - SpanBERT vs BERT (dynamic span masking, SBO, removal of NSP): “Unlike BERT, SpanBERT randomly covers up a continuous text and adds the SBO training target.”\n    - MASS vs UniLM: encoder-decoder masked-span reconstruction vs unified attention masking that simulates seq2seq behavior. This contrasts architectural coupling and objective design to task fit.\n\n- NLP pretraining task taxonomy (categorical comparison with rationale):\n  - “Pretraining Tasks for NLP” systematically distinguishes MLM, DAE, RTD, NSP, SOP and explains their differing assumptions/objectives (e.g., “RTD is a discriminant task… introduced in ELECTRA”; “NSP… to make the model understand the correlation between the two sentences”; “SOP… uses two contiguous fragments … as positive samples and the exchange order… as negative samples.”). This helps the reader understand task-level differences and when/why to use them.\n\n- Instruction aligning methods (SFT vs RLHF vs CoT):\n  - “Instruction-Aligning Methods” clearly separates approaches by supervision signal and optimization:\n    - SFT: “template … composed of input-output pairs and an instruction…”\n    - RLHF: “fine-tune large models with PPO against a trained reward model…”\n    - CoT: “prompting them to generate a series of intermediate steps… an emergent property of model scale…”\n  - The section highlights differences in objectives/assumptions (human preference modeling vs supervised instruction following vs reasoning‑step elicitation) and notes pros/risks (e.g., “risk of overfitting to metrics…” under RL).\n\n- CV self-supervised learning (comprehensive, structured contrasts across multiple axes: memory bank vs batch contrast, negatives vs no negatives, clustering vs instance discrimination, reconstruction vs contrastive):\n  - “Learning by Memory Bank” and “Learning by Sharing” provide a clear technical differentiation:\n    - MoCo (soft sharing, momentum encoder, queue of negatives): “The key design… momentum update… controls the consistency…”\n    - SimCLR (hard sharing, large batch negatives): “memory bank and momentum setting… are not necessary…”\n    - BYOL (no negatives, target network via momentum): “achieve a new SOTA without using negative samples… argue that many negative samples are not indispensable…”\n    - SwAV (clustering prototypes replace pairwise comparison): “introduces clustering to substitute the previous comparison between pairs…”\n  - “Learning by Reconstruction” contrasts BEiT (two-stage with tokenizer; “not end-to-end”) with MAE and SimMIM (end-to-end masked reconstruction; differences in masking ratio and encoder/decoder responsibility), and ties design to efficiency and performance: “MAE … masking ratio of 75%… higher masking ratios are beneficial…”; “LoMaR… focuses attention on local regions… outperforms MAE … in learning efficiency.”\n  - These comparisons identify architectural differences (momentum encoders, projection heads), objective differences (InfoNCE vs reconstruction vs clustering loss), data/compute assumptions (large batches vs queues; end-to-end vs tokenizers), and practical trade-offs (efficiency vs representation quality).\n\n- GL pretraining (method families with contrasted assumptions and objectives):\n  - “Learning by Graph Information Completion,” “Graph Consistency Analysis,” and “Graph Property Prediction” organize methods by pretext type and discuss core assumptions:\n    - Context consistency (DeepWalk/node2vec LINE) vs self consistency (contrastive augmentations, GCC/GCA/GraphCL) vs cross-scale consistency (DGI/CMVRL/SUBG-CON). The paper explains different notions of proximity/mutual information and how negatives are formed (e.g., “DGI corrupts the original graph by randomly scrambling node features while keeping the structure unchanged.”).\n    - Property regression vs classification tasks (NodeProperty vs clustering/partitioning), clarifying what signals are used and how pseudo-labels are constructed.\n\nWhere the paper falls short of a fully systematic, multi‑dimensional comparison:\n\n- Comparisons are strong in select subsections (NLP architecture/masking, CV SSL families, GL contrastive variants), but they are dispersed and not synthesized into a unified multi-criteria framework. For example, although many models are listed in large tables (e.g., “Summary of PFMs in NLP,” “Summary of the PFMs in CV,” “Summary of PFMs in GL”), the tables primarily catalog methods rather than explicitly contrast pros/cons, data requirements, failure modes, or application scenarios.\n- Some modality sections are primarily descriptive and lack explicit comparative analysis of advantages/disadvantages:\n  - “PFMs for Speech” and “PFMs for Video” largely list representative methods and applications without contrasting design trade-offs (e.g., discrete vs continuous representations, pretext alignment strategies, robustness considerations).\n  - “PFMs for Multimodal” enumerates single-stream vs cross-stream frameworks (e.g., VisualBERT, Unicoder-VL, ViLBERT), but the discussion focuses on pipeline descriptions more than explicit contrasts in alignment strategies, data dependency, and error profiles. Where contrasts exist (e.g., single-stream vs cross-stream), the pros/cons are not fully articulated beyond architectural description.\n- Even in strong sections, some comparisons remain high-level or lack explicit disadvantage statements. Example: in CV contrastive learning, the text implies but does not explicitly enumerate the compute/memory trade-offs (e.g., SimCLR’s large batch requirement vs MoCo’s queue), though it hints at them (“memory bank and momentum setting… are not necessary”).\n- The review rarely contrasts assumptions (e.g., homophily vs heterophily in GL; language modeling assumptions behind RTD vs MLM) beyond method descriptions, and it does not explicitly tie method choices to application scenarios or data regimes with systematic guidance.\n\nIn sum, the paper goes beyond simple listings and provides several clear, technically grounded comparisons (architecture, objectives, optimization strategies, and some efficiency considerations) especially in NLP and CV, and organizes GL methods by meaningful consistency/auxiliary task categories. However, the lack of a unified comparative framework across modalities and the descriptive nature of some sections prevent it from reaching the “systematic and comprehensive across multiple dimensions” bar for a 5.", "Score: 4/5\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey offers meaningful, technically grounded analytical interpretation across many method families and modalities, but the depth is uneven: several sections go beyond description to explain underlying mechanisms, trade-offs, and limitations, while others remain largely catalog-style. Below are specific places supporting this assessment.\n\nWhere the paper explains fundamental causes, design trade-offs, and limitations:\n- NLP pretraining objectives and training–inference mismatch:\n  - In “Word Representations Methods,” the paper explains why MLM can struggle for generation and why permuted LMs were introduced: “MLM uses the mask marking during pretraining but not during fine-tuning, which resulted in inconsistent data during pretraining and fine-tuning… To achieve bi-directional coding and avoid the problems of MLM, the permuted LM is proposed… [it] avoids the influence of inconsistent data.” This shows cause-and-effect reasoning (train/test mismatch) and motivates XLNet/MPNet.\n  - It contrasts autoregressive (GPT) vs bidirectional (BERT) modeling with concrete limitations: “GPT only uses the former words for prediction, which cannot learn bidirectional interaction information,” and “the document is encoded bidirectionally and missing tokens are predicted independently, which reduces the generation ability” (BERT/BART section). These statements clarify capability trade-offs.\n- Efficiency–effectiveness trade-offs in pretraining:\n  - In “Model Efficiency,” the analysis of ELECTRA pinpoints why RTD improves sample efficiency: “predicts whether each input marker is replaced… which enables ELECTRA to train against all input tokens,” directly explaining the efficiency cause.\n  - In “Boosting Methods,” ALBERT’s factorization and parameter sharing are connected to training speed/memory while aiming to preserve performance (“significantly reduces the number of parameters…without performance loss”), acknowledging the typical trade-off between compression and accuracy.\n- Vision masked modeling and architectural constraints:\n  - In “Learning by Reconstruction,” the discussion goes beyond summary and analyzes why end-to-end MAE improves on BEiT’s two-stage dVAE+masking (“separation… hinders learning effectiveness and efficiency”), why MAE can use very high masking ratios (“higher masking ratios are beneficial”), and why ViT patch-size scaling causes quadratic compute. It further diagnoses why hViT cannot be directly paired with MAE (“local window attention… makes it difficult to handle randomly masked patches”), and motivates UM-MAE’s two-stage sampling/masking as a remedy. This is a clear, technical chain from limitation to design workaround.\n  - LoMaR’s local windows are motivated by an insight about locality of information needed for reconstruction (“local knowledge is sufficient for reconstructing masked patches”), which connects architectural choices to data priors and efficiency.\n- Contrastive/self-supervised vision methods—stability and negatives:\n  - In “Learning by Sharing,” the paper explains MoCo’s momentum encoder as a consistency device: “direct parameter change… loses the necessary consistency,” hence the update rule θ_k = mθ_k + (1–m)θ_q. It also interprets BYOL’s removal of negatives as preventing collapse by target/online asymmetry (“necessary prevention from collapse… argue that many negative samples are not indispensable”)—an explicit discussion of stability/degeneracy.\n  - In clustering-based SSL, it motivates prototypes as semantic anchors that improve beyond instance discrimination (“clustering can help to encode more semantic information”), clarifying why PCL bridges clustering and contrastive learning.\n- Reinforcement learning for alignment (RLHF) and its risks:\n  - In “Instruction-Aligning Methods,” the paper flags a core failure mode: “risk of overfitting to metrics that use neural networks, leading to nonsensical samples that score well,” and notes ecosystem limitations (“lack of publicly available benchmarks and implementation resources”). This goes beyond description to candidly analyze constraints.\n- GANs for vision SSL—negative results with reasons:\n  - In “Challenges on Model Design,” the survey provides two concrete reasons GAN-based SSL is less popular: (1) learned representations in the discriminator being “forgotten” during training and (2) “mode collapse” causing degenerate generators. This is a rare, well-argued negative result discussion that explains why a line of work underperforms.\n- Generalization and transfer issues:\n  - The “Saturation Phenomena” in “Challenges on Finetuning and Prompt” explicitly argues that higher upstream accuracy does not always yield better downstream performance, a nuanced point about transfer that informs method design and evaluation.\n- Modality-specific robustness and transform semantics:\n  - In “Model Robustness,” the paper contrasts CV and NLP perturbations (“cutting and rotating do not change the nature of the image… adding, deleting, and substituting a word… likely affect the semantics”) to explain why adversarial robustness and augmentation transfer differently across domains.\n- Privacy and memorization:\n  - In “Security and Privacy,” it links model size to memorization risk (“because large models have so many parameters… larger models more prone”), grounding privacy concerns in capacity and training data leakage mechanisms.\n\nWhere the paper synthesizes relationships across research lines:\n- The survey repeatedly highlights “big convergence” across domains (e.g., “Transformer for PFMs” and “SOTA Unified PFMs”), drawing connections between MLM/MIM and unified architectures (e.g., BEiT-3’s Multiway Transformer; FLAVA’s multi-encoder vs single shared backbone in Uni-Perceiver/OFA/UNIFIED-IO). This helps readers see how methods migrate across NLP, CV, and multimodal settings.\n- It connects contrastive methods (MoCo/SimCLR/BYOL) with clustering (SwAV/PCL) and explains how prototypes serve as semantic structure, not just instance-level invariance.\n\nWhere the analysis is uneven or remains shallow, preventing a 5/5:\n- Several sections still read primarily as catalogs (e.g., long tables and many method lists), with limited comparative diagnostics—for instance, the large NLP “Boosting for Multi-task Learning” and “PFMs for Multimodal” parts mainly enumerate models and tasks without deeply dissecting when to prefer single-stream vs cross-stream architectures or the failure modes of each.\n- In graph learning, while the taxonomy (GIC, GPP, GCA) is clear and some motivations are given, there is less critical comparison of augmentation choices, failure cases (e.g., over-smoothing, sampling bias), or theoretical assumptions behind mutual-information estimators and their pitfalls.\n- The RLHF section could further analyze trade-offs between human feedback and AI feedback (RLAIF), reward hacking, and stability of PPO fine-tuning; the current commentary identifies risks but doesn’t deeply probe mitigation strategies or comparative outcomes.\n\nOverall judgment:\n- The paper frequently goes beyond description to explain why methods differ in behavior, where they break, and how newer designs address older limitations. It synthesizes cross-domain trends and highlights non-obvious constraints (e.g., windowed attention vs random masking; upstream–downstream nonlinearity; GAN pitfalls). However, this depth is not consistent across all method families, and several segments remain more descriptive than interpretive.\n\nResearch guidance value:\n- High. The identified mechanisms (train–inference mismatch, efficiency via RTD, architectural incompatibilities in masked modeling, SSL stability factors, upstream–downstream saturation, modality-specific robustness, and privacy risks) provide actionable insights for choosing or designing methods and for framing future research directions.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe paper provides a broad and reasonably systematic identification of research gaps across multiple dimensions—data, foundations, model design, fine-tuning/prompting, and unification—primarily in the section “Future Research Challenges and Open Problems,” with supporting material earlier (e.g., “Security and Privacy”). The coverage is comprehensive, but the analyses are mostly brief and high-level, with limited discussion of the concrete impact of each gap or detailed pathways to address them. This matches the 4-point criterion: several gaps are identified in a comprehensive way, yet the depth of analysis and impact discussion is not fully developed.\n\nEvidence from the paper:\n\n1) Gaps on data (good coverage, concise rationale, limited impact analysis)\n- “Challenges on Data” identifies three key gaps:\n  - Data Deficiencies for graphs: “Unlike NLP and CV, except for the reusable nodes in a few molecular and protein networks, most of the nodes and edges in the graph data do not have a large amount of unlabeled data for pretraining.” It notes early-stage graph pretraining and imperfect theory/augmentations for contrastive learning.\n  - Multimodal PFM: “the learning of multimodal PFMs requires new multimodal datasets… the construction of multimodal datasets is also an urgent problem.”\n  - Multi-lingual PFM: “multi-lingual vocabularies are much larger than single-language vocabularies, resulting in a sharp increase in model parameters to be learned.”\nThese are clear, field-relevant gaps. However, the paper does not deeply explore the downstream impact (e.g., how limited graph pretraining affects specific applications or benchmarks) or propose actionable methodologies for data creation, governance, or standardization.\n\n2) Gaps on theoretical foundations and semantics (clearly stated, brief implications)\n- “Challenges on Foundation” highlights:\n  - Lack of Theoretical Foundation: “SSL in CV learns the experience from the NLP. There is no profound theory to support all kinds of tentative experiments… the lack of theoretical foundation is still a huge cloud upon the head of SSL.” This is a meaningful gap; the impact is implied (uncertainty in method design and comparison), but not deeply analyzed.\n  - Semantic Understanding: “Does the pretrained LM learn the meaning of the language… performance is poor on domain datasets… cannot reach a better level of stability.” Important but briefly treated; no deep analysis of the consequences (e.g., safety, reliability) or concrete evaluation protocols to measure semantic grounding.\n\n3) Gaps on model design (breadth across several sub-gaps, limited depth per item)\n- “Challenges on Model Design” covers:\n  - Model Variety (GAN-based SSL difficulties: “discriminator… forgotten,” “mode collapse”), clarifying why GANs haven’t become mainstream for PFMs.\n  - Model Compression: specific scale figures (BERT-base ~108M; GPT-3 175B) and threshold concerns; explains the need for efficiency but does not assess trade-offs or application impact in detail.\n  - Model Robustness and Model Anti-attack: “how to design robust pretext tasks,” fair comparison challenges; vulnerability of DNNs; difficulty in NLP due to language discreteness. The importance is clear, but there’s little discussion on how robustness deficits concretely affect deployment or evaluation standards.\n\n4) Gaps on fine-tuning and prompting (noted phenomena, minimal impact elaboration)\n- “Challenges on Finetuning and Prompt”:\n  - Saturation Phenomena: cites Google Research on non-linear relationships between upstream/downstream performance—an important gap for transferability understanding.\n  - Pretext Task mismatch: “too many self-supervised tasks… difficult to match the relationship between pretext tasks and downstream tasks.”\n  - Task-based Graph limitations: node reuse prevents large-scale pretraining akin to NLP/CV.\nThese are pertinent and well-scoped but lack deeper exploration of the knock-on effects (e.g., how misaligned pretext tasks bias evaluation, or how to design task families).\n\n5) Open problems (clear, cross-domain targets; impact implied, not dissected)\n- “Open Problems for Future PFMs” lists:\n  - Inclusion of graphs in unified PFMs: “no work has considered the graph in their unified PFMs.”\n  - Unified backbone architecture preference (single-transformer).\n  - Achieving SOTA transfer across all tasks/modalities.\n  - Extending RL usage beyond NLP: “CV and GL do not have significant research published yet.”\nThese articulate valuable directions, but the paper does not deeply analyze feasibility, technical barriers, or expected field impacts (e.g., standardization benefits, compute constraints, evaluation harmonization).\n\n6) Security and privacy (well-cataloged issues, few forward-looking prescriptions)\n- The “Security and Privacy” section enumerates adversarial samples, backdoors, weight poisoning, data extraction (“possible to recover individual training examples… personally identifiable information”), and some defense notions. It closes with: “We must take privacy-preserving measures… during all PFM processes,” which signals a gap but remains general. The section reads more as a risk survey than a detailed future-work roadmap with impacts and mitigation strategies.\n\nWhy this is not a 5:\n- While the gap coverage is broad and touches on data, methods, evaluation, security, and unification, the analyses are mostly descriptive. The paper rarely details the potential impact of each gap on the field’s progress (e.g., implications for safety, reliability, resource allocation, or domain-specific adoption), nor does it propose specific research methodologies, benchmarks, or metrics to address them. There is little prioritization or discussion of interdependencies among gaps (e.g., how theoretical advances could reduce pretext–downstream mismatch).\n\nIn sum, the paper identifies many of the right gaps across key dimensions and provides concise justifications, earning a solid 4. However, it falls short of the depth and impact-oriented analysis needed for a 5.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe paper’s “Future Research Challenges and Open Problems” section identifies several forward-looking directions grounded in current gaps and practical constraints, but most proposals remain high-level and lack actionable detail or an analysis of academic/practical impact, which keeps it from a top score.\n\nWhat the paper does well (supports a 4):\n- Clearly surfaces concrete gaps and frames them as directions:\n  - Unified models including graphs: “Till the survey is written, no work has considered the graph in their unified PFMs. All of the SOTA unified models mainly focus on the language, vision, and language-vision tasks, while neglecting the importance of the graph in the data domain.” (Open Problems for Future PFMs). This is a specific, timely gap and points to a clear research direction: building unified PFMs that include graphs.\n  - Unified backbone emphasis and model convergence: “A unified backbone architecture for unified PFMs in future research will become more popular… a single-transformer model is more focused by researchers than other types of unified PFMs.” (Open Problems for Future PFMs). This captures the architectural consolidation trend and suggests a direction for future design.\n  - RL beyond NLP: “In terms of RL usage in PFMs, even though ChatGPT build the milestone in NLP, CV and GL do not have significant research published yet. More work in this direction is expected in the future.” (Open Problems for Future PFMs). This is a concrete call to extend successful alignment strategies to other modalities.\n  - Upstream–downstream inconsistencies: “Saturation Phenomena… the nonlinear relationship between the performance of upstream and downstream tasks… Even in the most extreme case, the performance of upstream and downstream is at odds.” (Challenges on Finetuning and Prompt). This highlights a fundamental gap and implicitly motivates research on better pretext-task design and evaluation protocols.\n  - Data-related real-world needs: \n    - “Data Deficiencies… most of the nodes and edges in the graph data do not have a large amount of unlabeled data for pretraining… data from the Internet of Things (IoT) will be enormous and contains rich physical world information.” (Challenges on Data). This ties future work to real data limitations and opportunities.\n    - “Multimodal PFM… the construction of multimodal datasets is also an urgent problem to be solved.” and “Multi-lingual PFM… multi-lingual vocabularies are much larger… resulting in a sharp increase in model parameters.” (Challenges on Data). These call out concrete dataset and scalability gaps with practical implications.\n  - Foundational and robustness gaps with practical relevance:\n    - “Lack of Theoretical Foundation” for SSL (Challenges on Foundation) and “Model Robustness” and “Model Anti-attack” (Challenges on Model Design) point to necessary, impactful research on reliability and security.\n    - Efficiency/Compression: “Model Compression… Parameter pruning… quantization… parameter sharing… structure compression” (Other Advanced Topics on PFMs — Model Compression), and “Model Efficiency” (same section) reflect real-world deployment constraints and suggest technical avenues.\n\nWhere the section falls short (why not a 5):\n- Limited specificity and actionability:\n  - Many directions are stated as aspirations without concrete research questions, methods, or milestones. For example, “A unified PFM is expected to achieve SOTA transfer performance for all different tasks in all data domains…” (Open Problems for Future PFMs) is visionary but lacks an actionable path (e.g., specific architectures, training curricula, or evaluation frameworks).\n  - “Multimodal datasets… urgent problem” and “Multi-lingual PFM… need to add new tasks” (Challenges on Data) identify problems but do not propose concrete strategies (e.g., data governance, annotation pipelines, retrieval-augmented curation, or weak supervision).\n  - “Lack of Theoretical Foundation” (Challenges on Foundation) flags the issue but does not outline specific theoretical avenues (e.g., information-theoretic objectives, generalization bounds, identifiability in SSL/RLHF).\n- Shallow analysis of impact and innovation:\n  - The potential academic and practical impacts are largely implied rather than analyzed. For instance, extending RL to CV/GL (Open Problems) would benefit controllability and safety, but the section does not discuss measurable benefits, risks, or how such methods differ across modalities.\n  - No prioritization or mapping of directions to real-world constraints (e.g., compute budgets, privacy regulations) beyond broad mentions in earlier “Security and Privacy” and “Model Compression” discussions.\n\nOverall, the paper provides a solid, forward-looking map of gaps and directions across data, foundations, model design, and tuning, and it flags several timely and impactful avenues (graphs in unified PFMs, RL beyond NLP, upstream–downstream mismatch). However, the proposals are mostly high-level and lack concrete, actionable research topics and a deeper assessment of their academic and practical impact, aligning best with a score of 4."]}
