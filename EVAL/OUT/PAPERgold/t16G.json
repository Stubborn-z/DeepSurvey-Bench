{"name": "G", "paperour": [4, 5, 3, 4, 4, 5, 4], "reason": ["Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\n- Research objective clarity: The Introduction clearly states the paper’s core objective and scope as a comprehensive, systematic survey of LLM-based agents. This is articulated in the paragraph beginning “In this paper, we present a comprehensive and systematic survey focusing on LLM-based agents, attempting to investigate the existing studies and prospective avenues in this burgeoning field.” The authors further specify concrete aims: tracing origins and technological trends (“we begin by delving into crucial background information”), justifying why LLMs are suitable agent brains, proposing a general conceptual framework (“Inspired by the definition of the agent, we present a general conceptual framework… with three key parts: brain, perception, and action”), and covering applications (single-, multi-agent, human-agent collaboration), social simulation, evaluation, risks, scaling, and open problems. These statements together make the research objective specific and aligned with current core issues in the field (e.g., AGI relevance, tool use, embodiment, multi-agent interactions).\n- Background and motivation: The Introduction provides strong background and motivation by situating agents philosophically and historically (Diderot and Turing references: “If they find a parrot…”; “Alan Turing… proposed the renowned Turing Test”), defining agents within AI (“an artificial entity capable of perceiving… making decisions… taking actions”), and identifying limitations of prior approaches (“these efforts have predominantly focused on… mastering particular tasks… Achieving broad adaptability remained elusive”). It clearly motivates LLMs as a turning point (“LLMs have demonstrated powerful capabilities… earned the designation of sparks for AGI”) and frames the World Scope (WS) levels as a roadmap (“According to the notion of World Scope (WS)… If we elevate LLMs to the status of agents… they have the potential to reach the third and fourth levels…”). These passages convincingly tie the motivation to the research objective of surveying LLM-based agents and proposing a framework.\n- Practical significance and guidance value: The Introduction outlines concrete guidance and practical value: proposing a conceptual framework (brain, perception, action) tailored to applications (“the framework can be tailored to suit different applications”), organizing the survey across applications and societal aspects (“Agents in Practice: Harnessing AI for Good,” “Agent Society”), and discussing evaluation, risks, and scaling (“Finally, we discuss… evaluation… potential risks… scaling up the number of agents… open problems”). The explicit design pursuit “Harnessing AI for good” provides a clear normative anchor for practical guidance. The breadth of planned coverage (e.g., tool use, embodied action, multi-agent cooperation/competition, human-agent interaction) indicates strong applicability and leadership for researchers and practitioners.\n\nReason for not awarding 5:\n- There is no Abstract provided in the text block, which reduces immediate objective clarity for readers who rely on the abstract to grasp contributions and scope quickly.\n- While the Introduction is thorough, the research objective is framed broadly as a survey and a conceptual framework without enumerated research questions or a systematic methodology for the survey (e.g., inclusion/exclusion criteria, corpus of works, time window). This slightly limits precision in how the survey will be conducted, preventing a perfect score on objective clarity.", "Score: 5\n\nExplanation:\nThe paper presents a clear and coherent method classification and a systematic, well-motivated evolution of methodologies, fully meeting the highest scoring criteria.\n\n- Method Classification Clarity:\n  - The survey introduces a general conceptual framework for LLM-based agents with three core modules—brain, perception, and action—in “The Birth of An Agent: Construction of LLM-based Agents.” The framework is explicit and consistently used throughout, with typology diagrams that make the classification tangible (e.g., “Typology of the brain module,” “Typology of the perception module,” “Typology of the action module”).\n  - Within the brain module, the authors further classify capabilities into Natural Language Interaction, Knowledge (with subtypes: linguistic, commonsense, professional/domain knowledge, plus issues like editing and hallucination), Memory (capability and retrieval strategies), Reasoning & Planning (plan formulation and reflection), and Transferability & Generalization (unseen task generalization, in-context learning, continual learning). Each category is distinctly defined and populated with representative techniques and works (e.g., CoT, Self-Consistency, Least-to-Most, Tree-of-Thoughts, ReAct), showing the internal structure of methods and their roles in agent cognition.\n  - The perception module clearly categorizes inputs into textual, visual, auditory, and other modalities, and explains architectural choices (e.g., query-based vs projection-based visual-language alignment, cascading vs transformer-like audio pipelines). This demonstrates a rational and interpretable taxonomy of multimodal perception methods.\n  - The action module presents a staged view of agent outputs: textual output, tool use (“Understanding tools,” “Learning tools,” “Using tools,” “Making tools”), and embodied actions. The subdivision into learning/using/making tools is particularly clear and aligns with progressive capability development, showing how tool use extends the agent’s action space and mitigates limitations like hallucination and lack of domain expertise.\n\n- Evolution of Methodology:\n  - The “Technological Trends in Agent Research” section systematically traces the evolution from symbolic agents to reactive agents, to reinforcement learning-based agents, to agents leveraging transfer/meta-learning, and finally to large language model-based agents. Each stage includes the defining methodology, strengths, limitations, and the motivation for transitioning to the next stage. For example, symbolic agents’ limits in handling uncertainty (“symbolic agents faced limitations in handling uncertainty and large-scale real-world problems”) and reactive agents’ lack of higher-level planning (“might lack complex higher-level decision-making”) motivate RL, whose sample efficiency and stability issues drive transfer and meta-learning, culminating in LLM-based agents that combine reasoning akin to symbolic approaches and interactivity akin to reactive agents.\n  - The paper explicitly articulates how LLM-based agents integrate and extend prior paradigms: “These LLM-based agents can exhibit reasoning and planning abilities comparable to symbolic agents… They can also acquire interactive capabilities with the environment, akin to reactive agents…” This shows the inheritance and synthesis across evolutionary stages, not just a chronological list.\n  - The “Why is LLM suitable…” section connects classical agent properties (autonomy, reactivity, pro-activeness, social ability) to LLM capabilities, clarifying the conceptual evolution from agent theory to LLM practice. This mapping demonstrates inherent connections between prior agent definitions and contemporary LLM-driven methods.\n  - The “Embodied Action” section reflects historical progression from RL (including HRL) to LLM-augmented planning, highlighting limitations of RL (data efficiency, generalization, reward specification) and how LLM knowledge, reasoning, and planning alleviate them. Subsections on cost efficiency, generalization, and planning show trends and the transition from end-to-end policies to LLM-guided high-level control.\n  - Beyond individual agents, the survey extends the evolutionary narrative to multi-agent interaction and societal simulation (“Agent Society”), demonstrating the progression from single-agent cognition to coordinated systems (cooperative and adversarial interactions) and then to macro-level social phenomena. This provides a broader technological trajectory: expanding perceptual/action spaces, then scaling to multi-agent coordination, and finally to societal-level simulation and evaluation.\n\nOverall, the paper’s method classification is comprehensive and well-structured, with clear, nested categories and typologies. The evolution is presented chronologically and conceptually, consistently explaining why each methodological shift occurred and how LLM-based agents inherit and unify prior approaches. Specific chapters supporting this score include “Technological Trends in Agent Research,” “The Birth of An Agent: Construction of LLM-based Agents” (and its submodules: Brain, Perception, Action), “Why is LLM suitable as the primary component of an Agent’s brain?” and “Embodied Action.” These parts collectively reveal the technological advancements and field development trends in a systematic, connected, and forward-looking manner.", "Score: 3/5\n\nExplanation:\n- Diversity of datasets and benchmarks:\n  - The survey touches a reasonably broad set of environments/benchmarks across several application areas, but coverage is uneven and largely mention-level without deeper detail.\n    - Web/navigation: In “Task-oriented Deployment” under “General Ability of Single Agent,” it cites Mind2Web (DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2306-06070), WebArena (DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2307-13854), WebShop (DBLP:conf/nips/Yao0YN22), WebGPT (DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2112-09332), WebAgent (DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2307-12856), and WebGum (DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2305-11854). This shows awareness of current web-agent datasets/benchmarks and simulators.\n    - Text-based environments: In “Text-based Environment,” it references TextWorld (DBLP:conf/ijcai/CoteKYKBFMHAATT18), AAAI 2020 text-game work (DBLP:conf/aaai/HausknechtACY20), and CAMEL (DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2303-17760), plus “Hoodwinked” (DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2308-01404). These are relevant testbeds for language-only agents.\n    - Virtual sandbox / embodied: In “Virtual Sandbox Environment” and “Lifecycle-oriented Deployment,” it mentions Minecraft as an embodied/survival testbed with Plan4MC (DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2303-16563), MineDojo (DBLP:conf/nips/FanWJMYZTHZA22), and Voyager (DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2305-16291). In “Embodied Action,” it also cites LM-Nav (DBLP:conf/corl/ShahOIL22), SoundSpaces (DBLP:conf/eccv/ChenJSGAIRG20), and PaLM‑E (DBLP:conf/icml/DriessXSLCIWTVY23).\n    - Scientific reasoning: “Innovation-oriented Deployment” mentions SCIENCEWORLD (DBLP:conf/emnlp/WangJCA22) and ChemCrow (bran2023chemcrow).\n    - Social simulation: “Agent Society” references Generative Agents (DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2304-03442), AgentSims (DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2308-04026), and S^3 (DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2307-14984).\n  - However, many foundational or widely used benchmarks are omitted, and dataset-level specifics are sparse:\n    - Classical web-agent/minimal UI benchmarks like MiniWoB++ are not discussed; in embodied navigation/manipulation, standard datasets/environments such as ALFRED, Habitat/Replica/MP3D, or CALVIN are not covered. For text games, Jericho is not mentioned. For vision/audio grounding, no canonical datasets (e.g., COCO/OK-VQA/ChartQA; LibriSpeech/AudioSet) are described. This weakens the claim of comprehensive dataset coverage.\n\n- Detail and rationale on datasets:\n  - The survey rarely provides details on dataset scale, splits, annotation protocols, or task formulations. For example, the mentions of Mind2Web, WebArena, WebShop, TextWorld, MineDojo, SCIENCEWORLD, etc., lack descriptions of size, labeling methods, or intended evaluation protocols. This places the coverage below the “fairly detailed” threshold for a 4/5.\n\n- Evaluation metrics and their rationality:\n  - The “Evaluation for LLM-based Agents” section offers a thoughtful and structured framework across four dimensions—utility, sociability, values, and continual evolution—which is a strength.\n    - Utility: It identifies “success rate of task completion” as the primary metric and names AgentBench (DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2308-03688) as an aggregate benchmark; it also emphasizes efficiency (time/resources), and capability-specific assessments (reasoning, planning, tool use, embodied action) (Evaluation section: “Utility... success rate... AgentBench... efficiency...”).\n    - Sociability: It proposes assessing language understanding and generation (including implied meanings, emotions), cooperation/negotiation quality, and role-stability in role-play (Evaluation section: “Sociability... language communication proficiency... cooperation and negotiation... role‑playing capability...”).\n    - Values: It discusses honesty/harmlessness, adversarial/jailbreak testing, human annotation, and agent-as-judge strategies (Evaluation section: “Values... honest, harmless... adversarial attacks or ‘jailbreak’... human annotations... other agents for ratings”).\n    - Continual evolution: It connects to continual learning with established metrics (overall performance, stability/plasticity), autotelic learning (skill acquisition speed/extent), and adaptability/generalization to new environments (Evaluation section: “Ability to evolve continually... continual learning... overall performance... memory stability... plasticity... autotelic learning... adaptability... generalization”).\n  - This metric framework is academically sound and well-motivated for agents. However, concrete metric definitions by domain are mostly missing (e.g., SPL for navigation, Success/Path Efficiency in manipulation, Pass@k for code, exact web-agent step success/subgoal success in Mind2Web/WebArena, debate win-rate/consistency in multi-agent evaluation, TruthfulQA/HHH-style value alignment metrics). The survey also does not discuss human evaluation protocols (inter‑annotator agreement, rubric design) or statistical testing, which would strengthen methodological rigor.\n\n- Overall judgment:\n  - Strengths: Broad, cross-domain awareness of agent benchmarks/environments; a coherent, multi-dimensional evaluation framework with sensible metric families; mention of a meta-benchmark (AgentBench).\n  - Gaps: Lack of dataset-specific detail (scale/annotations/splits), omission of several widely used benchmarks in key subfields, and limited mapping from specific datasets to standard, field-accepted metrics. The survey proposes metric categories but does not operationalize them with canonical metrics per domain or provide comparative tables/figures.\n\nGiven these strengths and gaps, the coverage and rationale for datasets and metrics are better than minimal but fall short of “fairly detailed” and comprehensive. Hence, a score of 3/5 is appropriate.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe paper provides a clear and mostly systematic comparison of major agent paradigms and method families, articulating advantages, disadvantages, commonalities, distinctions, and differences in architecture and learning objectives. However, some subsections present method lists with limited cross-method contrast, keeping parts of the comparison at a relatively high level. Below are specific sections and sentences that support this assessment:\n\n1) Technological paradigms contrasted across objectives, assumptions, and learning strategies\n- In “Technological Trends in Agent Research,” the authors compare Symbolic Agents, Reactive Agents, RL/DRL Agents, Transfer/Meta-learning Agents, and LLM-based Agents in a structured way:\n  - Symbolic Agents: “They possess explicit and interpretable reasoning frameworks… exhibit a high degree of expressive capability” but “faced limitations in handling uncertainty and large-scale real-world problems” and suffered from “challenging to find an efficient algorithm… within a finite timeframe.”\n  - Reactive Agents: Emphasize “quick and real-time responses… sense-act loop,” trading off “lack [of] complex higher-level decision-making and planning capabilities.”\n  - RL/DRL Agents: Designed to “achieve maximum cumulative rewards,” with noted drawbacks: “long training times, low sample efficiency, and stability concerns.”\n  - Transfer/Meta-learning: Presented as solutions to “expedite… learning on new tasks,” while acknowledging “negative transfer” and large pre-training/sample demands in meta-learning.\n  - LLM-based Agents: Positioned relative to previous paradigms: they “exhibit reasoning and planning abilities comparable to symbolic agents… interactive capabilities akin to reactive agents… few-shot and zero-shot generalization,” and “seamless transfer between tasks” (clear mapping of commonalities and distinctions).\nThis section systematically contrasts modeling perspectives (symbolic logic vs sense-act vs reward maximization vs pretraining), objectives (explicit reasoning vs reactivity vs cumulative reward vs generalization), data/modality assumptions (rule bases vs environmental interactions vs large corpora), and learning strategies (logic/rules vs reactive policies vs RL vs instruction-tuned LLMs), with explicit pros/cons.\n\n2) Architectural differences and trade-offs in multimodal perception\n- In “Perception → Visual Input,” differences between alignment architectures are articulated:\n  - Captioning is contrasted with end-to-end and frozen-encoder approaches: “However, caption generation is a low-bandwidth method… may lose a lot of potential information.”\n  - End-to-end training vs freezing encoders: “try to combine the image encoder and LLM directly… end-to-end… remarkable visual perception abilities, [but] substantial computational resources,” while “Freezing one or both… achieves a balance between training resources and model performance.”\n  - Interface layer design: “Q-Former… employs learnable query vectors… extract language-informative visual representations,” versus “single projection layer… computationally efficient” (BLIP-2/InstructBLIP vs LLaVA/Minigpt-4). These differences are tied to architecture and resource trade-offs.\n- In “Auditory Input,” analogous contrasts are given:\n  - Cascading tool use (AudioGPT) vs transformer-based spectrogram encoders (AST), and again “freezing encoders… adding the same learnable interface layer” to align modalities.\n\n3) Tool use: benefits, risks, and learning strategies\n- In “Action → Tool Using,” the paper lays out advantages (expertise extension, interpretability, robustness) and risks (decision transparency, adversarial susceptibility), and contrasts learning approaches:\n  - Understanding tools via “zero-shot prompts… few-shot prompts (demonstrations),” “learning from demonstrations” and “learning from feedback (environment and humans),” with explicit mention of generalization/meta-tool learning and curriculum learning to move from simple to complex tools.\n  - Distinguishes “learning tools,” “using tools,” and “making tools,” including “SELF-DEBUGGING” and “CREATOR,” and highlights interpretability and robustness gains compared to pure LLM decisions. This shows structured comparison across function and strategy.\n\n4) Embodied action: RL vs LLM-based approaches\n- In “Embodied Action,” the authors explicitly contrast RL’s limitations (“data efficiency, generalization, complex problem reasoning… heavy reliance on precise reward signals”) with LLM-based advantages:\n  - Cost efficiency (PaLM-E joint training and transfer),\n  - Generalization (zero/one-shot in PaLM-E; lifelong learning via skill libraries in Voyager),\n  - Planning (LLM high-level planning vs hierarchical RL; dynamic plan adjustment with environmental feedback).\nThis section clearly frames distinctions in assumptions (reward design vs language priors), data dependence, and planning architectures, with concrete examples.\n\n5) Multi-agent cooperation and competition: forms, pros/cons, and risks\n- In “Cooperative Interaction for Complementarity,” disordered vs ordered cooperation are defined and contrasted:\n  - Disordered cooperation: open discussion, need for coordinating agent/majority voting, challenge in integrating feedback.\n  - Ordered cooperation: sequential roles (e.g., CAMEL dual-agent), structured workflows (MetaGPT), risks such as “amplify minor hallucinations indefinitely” and suggested mitigation (cross-validation, external feedback).\n- In “Adversarial Interaction for Advancement,” debate mechanisms are highlighted with benefits (refinement via argumentation) and challenges (“limited context,” “computational overhead,” “incorrect consensus”).\nThis reflects systematic comparison of interaction paradigms with clear trade-offs.\n\n6) Clear identification of method-specific shortcomings in supporting sections\n- “Knowledge” section: acknowledges “outdated… incorrect knowledge… retraining… catastrophic forgetting,” and discusses targeted “editing… locate and modify specific knowledge,” and “hallucinations… metric to measure… external tools… alleviate” (explicit pros/cons and mitigation).\n- “Memory” section: compares strategies along capability and retrieval:\n  - “Raising the length limit…” (attention modifications vs truncation/segmentation/importance weighting),\n  - “Summarizing memory” vs “Compressing memories with vectors/data structures,” plus “Automated retrieval” vs “Interactive retrieval” with clear operational distinctions.\n\nWhere the paper falls short of a 5:\n- In “Brain → Reasoning & Planning,” many methods (CoT, Zero-shot-CoT, Self-Consistency, ToT, Self-Refine, Selection-Inference) are enumerated, but the contrasts of their assumptions, failure modes, and performance trade-offs are limited. Statements such as “representative Chain-of-Thought (CoT)… elicit reasoning” and “tree-like format… assess all possible paths” describe method families but do not systematically compare across multiple technical dimensions (e.g., data requirements, sensitivity to prompt variance, error propagation, compute).\n- Similarly, some subsections (e.g., parts of “Transferability and Generalization” and “Memory”) present families of approaches with high-level benefits but fewer explicit cross-method trade-offs or structured comparative tables/criteria. They are informative yet partly list-oriented.\n\nOverall, the paper succeeds in providing structured, technically grounded comparisons across major paradigms (symbolic/reactive/RL/LLM), multimodal alignment architectures, tool learning/usage/making, and multi-agent interaction modes, with explicit advantages/disadvantages and clearly articulated distinctions. The comparative depth is strong in the historical/architectural and interaction sections, but somewhat less exhaustive in the fine-grained contrasts of reasoning/planning algorithms and memory techniques. Hence, a score of 4 is appropriate.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey provides meaningful, technically grounded analytical interpretation across many method families, but the depth is uneven and some parts remain largely descriptive.\n\nStrong analytical elements and examples:\n- Technological trends and method trade-offs are explicitly analyzed. In “Technological Trends in Agent Research,” the paper contrasts Symbolic Agents, Reactive agents, RL-based agents, transfer/meta-learning, and LLM-based agents with clear causes for differences and limitations:\n  - Symbolic agents: “faced limitations in handling uncertainty and large-scale real-world problems… challenging to find an efficient algorithm capable of producing meaningful results within a finite timeframe.” This identifies fundamental algorithmic constraints and scalability challenges.\n  - Reactive agents: “require fewer computational resources… but might lack complex higher-level decision-making and planning capabilities.” This is a clear design trade-off between efficiency and cognitive sophistication.\n  - RL-based agents: “face challenges including long training times, low sample efficiency, and stability concerns, particularly when applied in complex real-world environments.” This grounds limitations in data/compute and dynamics modeling.\n  - Transfer/meta-learning: points out “negative transfer” and “substantial amount of pre-training and large sample sizes required… make it hard to establish a universal learning policy,” explaining failure modes and assumptions.\n  - LLM-based agents: the section synthesizes how LLMs recapture aspects of symbolic reasoning (CoT), reactivity (tool use and interaction), and transfer (few/zero-shot), articulating cross-line relationships.\n\n- The paper explains why LLMs suit agent “brains” with nontrivial trade-off reasoning. In “Why is LLM suitable…,” the authors note a specific reactivity trade-off: “LLM-based agents… require an intermediate step of generating thoughts… before translating them into concrete actions. This… reduces the response speed. However, this aligns closely with human behavioral patterns, ‘think before you act’.” This is precisely the kind of causal, interpretive commentary the evaluation seeks.\n\n- Perception module analysis goes beyond listing methods to explain design choices and costs:\n  - “Visual Input” critiques captioning as “a low-bandwidth method… may lose a lot of potential information,” then weighs end-to-end multimodal training against freezing encoders: “achieve[s] a balance between training resources and model performance.”\n  - It distinguishes interface architectures (Q-Former vs simple projection) and explains why Q-Former “extract[s] language-informative visual representations” to reduce catastrophic forgetting—a technically grounded rationale.\n  - For video, it discusses causal masking to preserve temporal order (Flamingo), connecting model architecture to modality-specific constraints.\n\n- Tool use is analyzed as an answer to LLM limitations, with interpretability and robustness arguments:\n  - “Tools… strengthen the agents’ capabilities” by mitigating memorization limits, domain specialization gaps, and “decision-making… lacks transparency.” It argues that tool execution traces “enhance the credibility” and robustness against adversarial perturbations—clear, causally reasoned benefits.\n  - It discusses learning tools via zero/few-shot documentation (“manuals”), multi-tool decomposition, generalization via “meta-tool learning” and “curriculum learning,” and the need for agent-tailored tool design. These are insightful, synthetic connections across learning paradigms.\n\n- Embodied action contains thoughtful causal analysis of RL vs LLM approaches:\n  - It highlights RL’s “data efficiency, generalization, and complex problem reasoning” issues due to “dynamic and often ambiguous real environment” and “reliance on precise reward signal representations,” then explains how LLM pretraining knowledge can alleviate them.\n  - It connects PaLM-E’s joint training and geometric inputs to “data efficiency” and transfer; and discusses partial observability and memory buffers, bridging planning theory (HRL) and CoT/self-reflection.\n  - It decomposes embodied actions (observation, manipulation, navigation) and ties method choices (topological/semantic/occupancy maps, VLM integration, audio spatial cues) to constraints of environment and control—this is technically reasoned synthesis.\n\n- Multi-agent sections include interpretive insights and risk analysis:\n  - Cooperative vs ordered/disordered workflows and role specialization (“division of labor”) are connected to efficiency and quality outcomes.\n  - It flags a nontrivial emergent failure mode: “frequent interactions among multiple agents can amplify minor hallucinations indefinitely,” motivating cross-validation and feedback—this is evidence-based, reflective commentary.\n  - Adversarial interactions are motivated via debate dynamics (feedback-driven correction, consensus risks), with concrete limitations (context window, compute, convergence to wrong consensus), showing balanced, critical reasoning.\n\n- Security and trustworthiness are treated analytically:\n  - “Adversarial Robustness” extends beyond text to multimodal attacks (images/audio) and tool-instruction vulnerabilities, and acknowledges the challenge of “holistically address[ing] robustness… while maintaining utility,” a nuanced design trade-off.\n  - “Trustworthiness” ties calibration, bias, and hallucinations to training data/model properties and suggests process supervision, external KBs, debiasing, and calibration—actionable, technically grounded commentary.\n\nWhere analysis is shallower or uneven:\n- Some subsections tend toward descriptive enumeration without deep causal mechanisms or comparative reasoning. For example:\n  - “Knowledge” notes outdated/wrong knowledge and proposes model editing, but does not deeply analyze the underlying mechanisms of knowledge storage or failure modes beyond saying “its underlying mechanism still requires further research.”\n  - “Memory” catalogs strategies (length limits, summarization, compression) and attention variants but gives limited comparative insight into when one strategy dominates another or the fundamental causes behind retrieval failures (beyond recency/relevance/importance).\n  - “Behavior and Personality” largely classifies behaviors and personality facets; while it contains a notable interpretive point (neutral conformity due to “helpful, honest, harmless” alignment), many claims remain high-level, with limited technical reasoning.\n  - “Key Properties and Mechanism of Agent Society” (open, persistent, situated, organized) is mostly definitional rather than analytical of design trade-offs or failure cases.\n\nOverall, the paper synthesizes lines of research and often explains the causes behind method differences and design decisions, especially in the trends, perception/action modules, tool use, and embodied action sections. However, the analytical depth is not uniform across all method areas, with some segments remaining descriptive. Hence, a score of 4 reflects meaningful critical analysis with some underdeveloped parts rather than the consistently deep mechanistic critique required for a 5.\n\nResearch guidance value:\n- High. The survey articulates clear trade-offs (e.g., captioning vs direct vision-language alignment; end-to-end vs frozen encoders; plan-all-at-once vs adaptive planning; RL vs LLM planning and partial observability; ordered vs disordered multi-agent collaboration; adversarial risks across modules), identifies limitations (context window, hallucination amplification, robustness vs utility), and proposes concrete directions (meta-tool learning, curriculum tool learning, process supervision, external KB/tool integration, memory summarization/compression, dynamic scaling of multi-agent teams). These insights provide actionable guidance for researchers designing agent architectures, evaluation protocols, and robustness/trust frameworks.", "Score: 5\n\nExplanation:\nThe review comprehensively identifies and analyzes research gaps across data, methods, evaluation, deployment, and societal dimensions, and consistently discusses why these issues matter and their potential impact. The gaps are not only enumerated but also grounded in technical causes, practical constraints, and consequences for the field. Below are specific supporting parts, by section, with the key sentences or arguments that substantiate this assessment.\n\n- Brain: Knowledge and Memory\n  - Knowledge gaps: The paper explicitly notes problems of outdated and incorrect knowledge and explores model editing as a remedy (“the knowledge acquired by models during training could become outdated or even be incorrect… retraining… can lead to catastrophic forgetting… some researchers try editing LLMs… Their experiments show… can partially edit factual knowledge, but its underlying mechanism still requires further research.” in “Knowledge”). It analyzes impact (trustworthiness, applicability to fact-sensitive tasks) and mitigation (tool use, hallucination metrics).\n  - Hallucination: It frames hallucinations as “critical reasons why LLMs can not be widely used in factually rigorous tasks,” proposes measurement and mitigation (external tools, retrieval-augmented techniques), and highlights remaining needs (“further exploration of more effective approaches is still needed.”).\n  - Memory limits: It identifies sequence length constraints and retrieval difficulty with causes (“Transformer architecture struggles with long sequences… pairwise token calculations… truncation” in “Memory”) and analyzes methods (attention variants, summarization, embeddings, SQL-backed memory) and why this matters for long-horizon agent operation.\n\n- Perception and Action\n  - Perception alignment and bandwidth: The paper critiques low-bandwidth captioning (“may lose a lot of potential information”) and details alignment challenges between visual/audio encoders and LLMs (need for Q-Former, projection layers), including trade-offs between performance and compute (“freezing encoders… balance… training resources and model performance”), showing method-level gaps and impacts on multimodal agent competence.\n  - Reactivity speed: It explicitly acknowledges a core agent limitation—latency induced by “think before you act” textual intermediates (“reduces the response speed. However, this aligns closely with human behavioral patterns.” in “Reactivity”)—clarifying the practical impact on real-time use.\n  - Tool use: It analyzes gaps in interpretability, robustness, and domain expertise (“LLM-based agents… lack transparency… susceptible to adversarial attacks… agents that accomplish tasks with the assistance of tools exhibit stronger interpretability and robustness.”), and proposes future directions (meta-tool learning, curriculum learning, agent-oriented tool design), with clear ramifications for safety and specialization.\n  - Embodiment: The paper deeply explores sim-to-real challenges and RL limitations (data efficiency, reward specification, generalization) and presents LLM-mediated improvements (PaLM-E, SayCan, Voyager), but still flags core constraints (“high costs of physical-world robotic operators and the scarcity of embodied datasets… disparity between simulated platforms and the physical world… need for evaluation criteria… language grounding,” in “Embodied Action”). It ties these to field development and deployment viability.\n\n- Applications and Practice\n  - Scientific innovation: It highlights data scarcity and representation complexity (“inherent complexity of science… severe lack of suitable training data,” in “Innovation-oriented Deployment”), explains risks (harmful synthesis), and underscores ethical implications.\n  - Multi-agent systems: It identifies concrete gaps such as hallucination amplification, context-window limits, computational overhead, and convergence to wrong consensus (“With prolonged debate, LLM's limited context cannot process the entire input… computational overhead significantly increases… may converge to an incorrect consensus,” in “Adversarial Interaction for Advancement”), and suggests remedies (coordinator agents, voting, cross-validation, external feedback).\n  - Human-agent interaction: It analyzes burdens of human-in-the-loop and contrasts quantitative vs qualitative feedback (trade-offs in granularity, reliability), recommending combined feedback and continual learning—pinpointing method and usability gaps.\n\n- Agent Society\n  - Social risks and behaviors: The review details negative group behaviors, confrontational and destructive tendencies, and neutrality biases, connecting them to model alignment (“helpful, honest, harmless”) and showing how these shape social dynamics and system design constraints (“Behavior and Personality”).\n  - Environment types: It lays out limitations and strengths of text-based, sandbox, and physical environments, with technical implications for sensing and motion control (“necessitates executable and grounded motion control,” in “Physical Environment”).\n\n- Discussion: Systematic Future Work and Evaluation Frameworks\n  - Evaluation gaps: It states that “quantifying and objectively evaluating [agents] remains a challenge” and proposes four dimensions—utility, sociability, values, continual evolution—each with concrete metrics and drawbacks (e.g., task success rates, cooperation smoothness, role fidelity, honest/harmless benchmarks, adversarial/jailbreak testing, continual learning metrics). This is a strong methods-level contribution and closes an evaluation gap with actionable guidance (“Evaluation for LLM-based Agents”).\n  - Security and trustworthiness: It analyzes adversarial robustness across modalities and actions, calibration uncertainty, bias and fairness, and hallucinations, with mitigation strategies (adversarial training, augmentation, detection, external knowledge integration, process supervision, debiasing, calibration). It makes clear the impact (destructive actions, societal harm) and the stakes for deployment (“Security, Trustworthiness and Other Potential Risks”).\n  - Scaling up agents: It contrasts pre-determined vs dynamic scaling, identifies challenges (compute, communication reliability, coordination), and ties scaling to realism and efficiency (“Scaling Up the Number of Agents”). This is both architectural and methodological.\n  - Open Problems: It directly frames unresolved questions (AGI path debate, sim-to-real transition, collective intelligence, Agent as a Service), articulates why each matters (e.g., deployment risk, policy/regulatory needs, cloud service privacy/robustness), and how they influence the trajectory of the field (“Open Problems”).\n\nOverall, the paper’s treatment of gaps is multi-dimensional (data scarcity, model limits, algorithmic robustness, evaluation standardization, systems scalability, ethical and social risks), reasoned (explains causes and mechanisms), and impact-aware (ties gaps to trust, safety, usability, and real-world deployment). This breadth and depth align with the 5-point criteria.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey proposes several forward-looking research directions grounded in clear gaps and real-world needs, but the analysis of potential impact and implementation pathways is often high-level rather than deeply elaborated, which aligns with the 4-point description.\n\nEvidence from specific parts of the paper:\n\n- Open Problems section:\n  - “From virtual simulated environment to physical environment” explicitly identifies the gap between simulated and real-world settings and proposes concrete research avenues: hardware interface design (“designing a dedicated interface or conversion mechanism between the agent and the hardware device”), enhanced environmental generalization (instruction understanding, skill acquisition, handling limited context), and safety standards (“appropriate regulations and standards are highly necessary”). These directions directly address real-world deployment needs and are forward-looking, but the paper does not provide detailed methodological blueprints or impact assessments, making the analysis somewhat brief.\n  - “Collective intelligence in AI agents” highlights the need to coordinate agents to avoid groupthink and leverage communication/evolution for societal experiments. This is an innovative research topic that connects to multi-agent learning gaps, yet the paper does not deeply analyze concrete mechanisms or evaluation protocols to ensure robust collective reasoning.\n  - “Agent as a Service / LLM-based Agent as a Service” proposes offering agents via cloud service models (AaaS/LLMAaaS), explicitly noting challenges in privacy, controllability, cloud migration, robustness, and misuse. This is tightly linked to real-world needs (operationalization and accessibility), but suggested solutions remain at a conceptual level without detailed frameworks for governance or technical compliance.\n\n- Scaling Up the Number of Agents (Discussion):\n  - The paper distinguishes “Pre-determined scaling” and “Dynamic scaling,” and suggests designs where agents autonomously add or remove members to manage workload and efficiency. It also identifies core challenges (computational burden, complex communication networks, reliability risks, coordination difficulty) and calls for “better architectural design and computational optimization.” These are concrete, forward-looking directions that tackle a recognized gap (most current work uses few agents). However, the survey provides limited actionable methodologies or measures of academic/practical impact beyond problem statements.\n\n- Security, Trustworthiness and Other Potential Risks (Discussion):\n  - Adversarial robustness: The paper recognizes multi-modal and tool-use attack surfaces as new agent risks and proposes adaptations of known defenses (adversarial training, augmentation, detection) and human-in-the-loop supervision. This clearly ties to real-world safety needs, but the proposed solutions are largely borrowed from prior fields and do not present novel, agent-specific defense architectures or evaluation pipelines across perception–cognition–action modules.\n  - Trustworthiness: It identifies calibration, bias, and hallucination as core gaps and suggests process supervision, external knowledge integration, debiasing, and calibration techniques. The directions are relevant and necessary for deployment, but the analysis of how these methods translate into agent-level guarantees, their measurable impact, and standardized protocols remains brief.\n\n- Evaluation for LLM-based Agents (Discussion):\n  - The survey proposes a structured, multi-dimensional evaluation agenda (utility, sociability, values, continual evolution), referencing benchmarks (e.g., AgentBench) and suggesting metrics for continual learning (stability/plasticity), autotelic learning, and adaptability/generalization. These are forward-looking and respond to a genuine gap (lack of standardized evaluations for agents). However, the paper stops short of prescribing concrete, actionable evaluation designs (e.g., specific tasks, datasets, scoring rubrics) or analyzing practical/academic impact in depth.\n\n- Mutual Benefits between LLM Research and Agent Research (Discussion):\n  - The paper outlines bi-directional opportunities: integrating LLM decision-making/planning into traditional agent frameworks; expanding action spaces (tools/robotic APIs); safe sequencing of actions; sustaining role-playing in multi-agent cooperation. These are pertinent directions but are articulated at a conceptual level without detailed methodologies or cause–effect analyses.\n\nOverall assessment:\n- Strengths: The survey identifies key gaps and real-world challenges (deployment on physical hardware, scaling multi-agent societies, safety and trust, evaluation standards, service models) and proposes multiple forward-looking directions and new topics (dynamic scaling, autotelic learning for continual evolution, policy simulation in agent societies, AaaS). It frequently ties these to concrete needs (privacy, robustness, safety, efficiency, governance).\n- Limitations: Many suggestions remain high-level; the paper does not consistently provide thorough analyses of academic and practical impact, detailed cause–impact chains for each gap, or clear, actionable research roadmaps (methods, datasets, benchmarks, design patterns). As a result, while innovative and relevant, the prospectiveness discussion is somewhat shallow in places.\n\nGiven this balance of strengths and limitations, a score of 4 points is appropriate."]}
