{"name": "G", "paperour": [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4], "reason": ["Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\n- Research Objective Clarity: The Introduction states explicit research questions and objectives. The authors clearly articulate that the survey will “comprehensively review previous studies to present clear taxonomies and key principles for designing and evaluating the memory module,” and will address “three key problems including: (1) what is the memory of LLM-based agents? (2) why do we need the memory in LLM-based agents? and (3) how to implement and evaluate the memory in LLM-based agents?” These sentences in the Introduction demonstrate a well-defined scope and structure. Additionally, the “Main contributions” list (e.g., “We formally define the memory module and comprehensively analyze its necessity… We systematically summarize existing studies… We present typical agent applications… We analyze key limitations…”) further clarifies the intent and deliverables of the survey. This is closely aligned with a core issue in the field: the lack of a holistic treatment of memory mechanisms in LLM-based agents (“there still lacks a systemic study to view the memory modules from a holistic perspective. To bridge this gap…”).\n- Background and Motivation: The Introduction provides sufficient background and motivation. It contextualizes the rise of LLMs and the transition to interactive agents aimed at AGI, emphasizing why memory “is a key component that differentiates the agents from original LLMs” and its role in actions, knowledge accumulation, and reasoning. The motivation is directly supported by identifying a gap (“there still lacks a systemic study…”) and giving concrete examples of prior efforts (e.g., Reflexion, MemoryBank, RET-LLM) to illustrate a fragmented landscape that needs synthesis. The subsequent “Related Surveys” section (though outside the Introduction, it is referenced early and positioned to support the paper’s motivation) thoroughly maps existing surveys on LLMs and agents, strengthening the claim that a focused survey on memory is missing.\n- Practical Significance and Guidance Value: The Introduction argues practical value through multiple points. It claims novelty (“To our knowledge, this is the first survey on the memory mechanism of LLM-based agents”), promises actionable frameworks (“present clear taxonomies and intuitive insights”), and points to downstream utility (“present typical agent applications… show the importance of the memory module in different scenarios,” and “highlight significant future directions”). The roadmap at the end of the Introduction (how sections are organized) also suggests a structured, guiding survey that practitioners and newcomers can follow. These elements indicate clear academic and practical relevance to researchers designing agent memory and evaluating memory modules.\n\nReasons for not awarding 5:\n- The Abstract is missing from the provided content. For objective clarity, a concise Abstract is critical to summarize aims, scope, methods (e.g., survey methodology or inclusion criteria), and contributions upfront. Its absence slightly reduces immediate clarity and accessibility of objectives for readers.\n- While the objectives are well stated, they could be strengthened by briefly outlining the survey methodology (e.g., sources searched, time window, inclusion/exclusion criteria) in the Introduction. This would anchor the objectives in a transparent process.\n- Some claims (e.g., “first survey”) would benefit from a brief substantiation or qualification given the many adjacent surveys in LLM/agent literature. Also, several citations appear as placeholders, which can weaken the perceived rigor of the background.\n\nOverall, the Introduction presents clear, specific, and aligned objectives with a well-motivated gap and strong practical significance, but the absence of an Abstract and lack of methodological framing keep it from the highest score.", "4\n\nDetailed explanation:\n- Method Classification Clarity:\n  - The paper presents a clear, multi-dimensional taxonomy for the memory mechanism, which is consistently applied across sections:\n    - In “How to Implement the Memory of LLM-based Agent,” the authors explicitly structure methods into three orthogonal dimensions: memory sources, memory forms, and memory operations. The opening sentence of that section states: “In this section, we discuss the implementation of the memory module from three perspectives: memory sources, memory forms, and memory operations.”\n    - Memory sources are clearly categorized into “Inside-trial Information,” “Cross-trial Information,” and “External Knowledge,” with representative studies and a “Discussion” subsection for each category. This three-way split directly reflects the conceptual framework established earlier in “Broad Definition of the Agent Memory,” where memory is said to come from “the historical information within the same trial,” “the historical information across different trials,” and “external knowledge” (the section explicitly formalizes these as ξt^k, Ξ^k, and Dt^k).\n    - Memory forms are clearly split into “Textual Form” and “Parametric Form.” Within textual form, the subcategories “Complete Interactions,” “Recent Interactions,” “Retrieved Interactions,” and “External Knowledge” further refine the classification and map to practical strategies (e.g., caching vs retrieval), and each subcategory cites representative works and discusses limitations (e.g., long-context limitations in “Complete Interactions” referencing lost_in_the_middle). For parametric form, the authors distinguish “Fine-tuning Methods” versus “Memory Editing Methods,” again with representative works and pros/cons.\n    - Memory operations are clearly delineated into “Memory Writing,” “Memory Management,” and “Memory Reading,” aligning with the earlier conceptual pipeline in “Memory-assisted Agent-Environment Interaction,” where the operations W (writing), P (management), and R (reading) are formalized and combined into a unified function: “a_{t+1} = LLM{R(P(M_{t-1}^k, W({a_t^k, o_t^k})), c_{t+1}^k)}.” This formalization anchors the taxonomy and clarifies how categories interoperate.\n  - The clarity is further supported by repeated “Representative Studies” and “Discussion” subsections within each category, which make the classification grounded and understandable (e.g., Reflexion and Retroformer in “Cross-trial Information,” MemoryBank and RET-LLM in “Retrieved Interactions,” Character-LLM and Huatuo in “Fine-tuning Methods,” MEND/KnowledgeEditor in “Memory Editing Methods”).\n  - The paper also provides a strong foundational conceptual section “What is the Memory of LLM-based Agent,” with precise definitions of Task, Environment, Trial/Step, narrow vs broad memory, and a toy example. This scaffolding aids the classification clarity.\n\n- Evolution of Methodology:\n  - The survey presents an implicit evolution path of the field via problem-driven transitions and trade-offs rather than a strict chronological timeline:\n    - Movement from “Complete Interactions” (long-context prompts) to more efficient strategies (e.g., “Recent Interactions” caching and “Retrieved Interactions” via embeddings/FAISS/LSH) is framed as a response to scalability and robustness issues. For instance, “While storing all the agent-environment interactions can maintain comprehensive information, obvious limitations exist… All these drawbacks show the need to design extra memory modules…” This articulates a trend away from naïve long-context concatenation toward retrieval-based or cache-based memory systems.\n    - The transition from purely internal, short-term memory (“Inside-trial Information”) to durable, cross-trial memory (“Cross-trial Information”) is motivated by experience accumulation and self-evolution (discussed in “Why We Need the Memory…” and the “Cross-trial Information” section’s “Discussion”). This reflects the field’s progression toward agents that learn from past successes and failures (e.g., Reflexion → Retroformer).\n    - The incorporation of “External Knowledge” (e.g., ReAct, Toolformer, ToolLLM) shows an evolution from closed-environment memory to tool-augmented, dynamically updated memory, addressing outdated or incomplete internal knowledge.\n    - The evolution in representation from “Textual” to “Parametric” memory is explicitly acknowledged: “An alternative type of approaches is to represent memory in parametric form… still under-researched” and then split into “Fine-tuning Methods” and “Memory Editing Methods,” with a nuanced trade-off discussion (“Advantages and Disadvantages of Textual and Parametric Memory”) that signals an emerging trend toward denser and potentially more efficient parametric memory, while recognizing current challenges (efficiency, interpretability).\n  - The “Limitations & Future Directions” section deepens the evolutionary storyline by identifying next steps:\n    - “More Advances in Parametric Memory” points to meta-learning and pluggable parametric memory as future trajectories (e.g., MAC, MEND), indicating a forward-looking trend beyond textual memory.\n    - “Memory in LLM-based Multi-agent Applications” introduces synchronization, communication, and information asymmetry as new fronts, suggesting the field’s expansion from single-agent memory to multi-agent memory systems.\n    - “Memory-based Lifelong Learning” and “Memory in Humanoid Agent” articulate longer-term research directions that extend the memory concept in temporal and human-aligned dimensions.\n  - However, the evolutionary connections among specific methods and their chronological progression are not fully systematized. For example, while the survey mentions Reflexion and Retroformer in succession, it does not build a detailed lineage or staged progression across broader method families (e.g., a timeline or a layered evolutionary map from long-context → retrieval → reflection → parametric editing). Similarly, the “Related Surveys” section, though comprehensive, does not directly trace the evolution of memory mechanisms but rather situates the survey in the broader LLM/agent literature.\n  - Overall, the technological trends are well implied and partially articulated through problem–solution narratives and trade-off analyses, but a more explicit, systematic mapping of method inheritance and chronological milestones would improve the evolution narrative.\n\nWhy 4 points:\n- The classification is strong, coherent, and consistently applied across multiple sections, with clear definitions, categories, representative works, and discussions—meeting most criteria for a top score on clarity.\n- The evolution is present and insightful through transitions and future directions, but it lacks a fully systematic, staged historical narrative and explicit inter-method linkage across the entire field. Hence, it falls slightly short of the “completely clear and systematically presented evolution” needed for 5 points.", "3\n\nExplanation:\n- Diversity of datasets and metrics: The survey offers a broad set of evaluation metrics but only a modest coverage of datasets/benchmarks. In “How to Evaluate the Memory in LLM-based Agent,” it systematically introduces:\n  - Subjective metrics such as “Coherence” and “Rationality” (see “Subjective Evaluation”), citing uses in prior work (e.g., “memorybank and tim assess the coherence…,” “mpc ask crowd workers to directly score the rationality…”).\n  - Objective metrics including “Result Correctness” with an explicit accuracy formula (“Correctness = 1/N ∑ I[a_i = a_i]”), “Reference Accuracy” with F1, precision, and recall (“F1 = 2·Precision·Recall/(Precision + Recall)…”) and efficiency metrics (“Time & Hardware Cost” with an explicit time consumption formula and peak GPU memory; “mac utilize the peak memory allocation and adaptation time…”).\n  - Indirect evaluation metrics for downstream tasks: conversation metrics (consistency and engagement, with SCE-p and CSIM mentioned in “Conversation”), long-context benchmarks (ZeroSCROLLS and LongBench named in “Long-context Applications” with ROUGE for summarization), and task success/exploration metrics (“Other Tasks,” e.g., success rate in AlfWorld and exploration degree in Minecraft).\n  However, dataset coverage is relatively thin. While the survey names several benchmarks/datasets—AlfWorld (“react, reflexion and expel… in AlfWorld”), ZeroSCROLLS (“zeroscrolls propose a zero-shot benchmark…”), LongBench (“long-context passage retrieval… ~longbench”)—there is little detail on their scale, annotation protocol, domains, or data splits. There is no dedicated Data section, and benchmark descriptions are brief and high-level.\n\n- Rationality of datasets and metrics: The choices of metrics are generally appropriate and well-justified for assessing memory. The survey clearly ties metrics to memory-specific capabilities:\n  - Direct, stand-alone memory evaluation metrics (accuracy, F1 for retrieval, latency and GPU memory) are academically standard and practically meaningful (“Objective Evaluation”).\n  - Subjective assessments of coherence/rationality are aligned with real-world memory quality in agents (“Subjective Evaluation”).\n  - Indirect task-based evaluation focuses on memory-dependent scenarios (conversation consistency/engagement in “Conversation,” multi-source QA integrating inside-trial, cross-trial, and external knowledge in “Multi-source Question-answering,” long-context retrieval/summarization in “Long-context Applications,” and success/exploration in interactive environments in “Other Tasks”). This is a sensible way to probe whether memory mechanisms help end-to-end performance.\n  The survey also thoughtfully acknowledges a gap in benchmarking: “to our knowledge, there are no open-sourced benchmarks tailored for the memory modules in LLM-based agents” (“Discussions”), which highlights the current limitations of dataset availability for direct memory evaluation.\n\n- Why not a higher score: The metric coverage is strong and well targeted, but the dataset coverage lacks depth. The paper does not provide detailed dataset descriptions (scale, labeling methods, application scenarios per dataset) or comprehensive coverage of memory-specific datasets; many mentions of datasets/benchmarks are cursory. For example, AlfWorld, ZeroSCROLLS, and LongBench are named without discussion of their sizes, annotation processes, or the exact evaluation protocols used in the cited memory-agent contexts. Some metrics (SCE-p, CSIM) are mentioned but not explained or contextualized in detail regarding their computation or validation.\n\nGiven the strong metric framework but limited dataset detail and breadth, a score of 3 reflects that the review covers a limited set of datasets with insufficient detail, while the metrics are mostly reasonable and aligned with the field’s needs.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe paper provides a clear and structured comparison of memory-related methods across several meaningful dimensions, but some parts remain at a relatively high level and could be further deepened with more technical contrasts among specific methods.\n\nEvidence supporting the score:\n\n- Systematic organization and architectural framing:\n  - In “Memory-assisted Agent-Environment Interaction,” the paper presents a unified functional formulation of memory operations via W (writing), P (management), and R (reading), and explicitly contrasts how prior works instantiate these components: “In reflexion, R and P are set as identical functions, and P only takes effect at the end of a trial. In generative_agents, R is implemented based on three criteria including similarity, time interval, and importance, and P is realized by a reflection process...” This shows architectural differences and commonalities across methods and provides a principled basis for comparison beyond listing.\n\n- Multi-dimensional comparison of memory sources with pros/cons:\n  - “Memory Sources” is divided into “Inside-trial Information,” “Cross-trial Information,” and “External Knowledge,” each with “Representative Studies” and a “Discussion” subsection that articulates advantages and limitations.\n    - Inside-trial Information: The discussion acknowledges its relevance but notes that “relying solely on inside-trial information may prevent the agent from accumulating valuable knowledge from various tasks and learning more generalizable information.”\n    - Cross-trial Information: It positions this as long-term memory and explains benefits for experience accumulation and evolution, while implicitly contrasting it with short-term inside-trial signals.\n    - External Knowledge: The discussion highlights strengths and risks, e.g., “most external knowledge can be acquired by accessing the APIs... thus mitigating the problem of outdated knowledge,” but also cautions that “the reliability of this information can be questionable... privacy, data security, and compliance with usage policies.”\n\n- Detailed, multi-dimensional comparison of memory forms:\n  - The “Memory Forms” section distinguishes textual versus parametric memory and then provides a dedicated “Advantages and Disadvantages of Textual and Parametric Memory” subsection comparing them across three concrete dimensions:\n    - Effectiveness: Textual being comprehensive but token-limited vs. parametric not limited by prompt length but prone to information loss during encoding.\n    - Efficiency: Textual is “more efficient in writing,” parametric is “more efficient in reading,” with clear reasoning on inference and adaptation costs.\n    - Interpretability: Textual memory is “usually more explainable,” while parametric memory is denser but less interpretable.\n  - Within textual memory, the paper further breaks down strategies: “Complete Interactions,” “Recent Interactions,” “Retrieved Interactions,” and “External Knowledge,” each with implementation details and explicit drawbacks:\n    - Complete Interactions: “obvious limitations exist in terms of computational cost, inference time, and inference robustness,” and references “lost_in_the_middle.”\n    - Recent Interactions: “Caching... is an effective way... However, in long-term tasks, this method fails to access key information from distant memories.”\n    - Retrieved Interactions: “retrieval methods considerably depend on the accuracy and efficiency... heavy retrieval system can lead to large computational costs,” and notes difficulty with “heterogeneous information.”\n    - External Knowledge: trade-offs including “potential inaccuracies and biases,” and integration costs.\n  - Within parametric memory, the paper clearly contrasts “Fine-tuning Methods” and “Memory Editing Methods,” detailing objectives, assumptions, and limitations:\n    - Fine-tuning: risks of “overfitting,” “catastrophic forgetting,” “computational cost and time consumption,” and being “seldom” suitable for online scenarios.\n    - Knowledge editing: “lower computational costs,” suitability for “online scenarios,” and remaining challenges (e.g., meta-training costs, preserving unrelated memories).\n\n- Comparison of memory operations:\n  - The “Memory Operations” section separates “Memory Writing,” “Memory Management,” and “Memory Reading,” and within each, provides representative methods and “Discussion” that articulate differences in strategy (e.g., writing raw vs. summarized, management via reflection/merging/forgetting, reading via SQL/FAISS/dense retrieval), and ties these choices back to practical trade-offs (accuracy, efficiency, relevance).\n\n- Evaluation methodologies contrasted with pros and cons:\n  - “How to Evaluate the Memory” compares “Direct Evaluation” (subjective vs. objective metrics) and “Indirect Evaluation” (via tasks), with explicit strengths and weaknesses:\n    - Subjective evaluation: notes evaluator selection, labeling granularity, and reproducibility concerns.\n    - Objective evaluation: introduces numeric metrics (“Result Correctness,” “Reference Accuracy,” “Time & Hardware Cost”) with formulas, enabling structured comparison.\n    - Indirect evaluation: acknowledges practicality and available benchmarks, but cautions that performance can be confounded by factors beyond memory; it also notes “to our knowledge, there are no open-sourced benchmarks tailored for the memory modules.”\n\nWhy not a 5:\n- While the paper is well-structured and covers multiple dimensions (sources, forms, operations, evaluation), many comparisons remain qualitative and high-level. For example, within retrieval methods, the paper mentions FAISS, LSH, SQL-based retrieval, and dense encoders but does not provide deeper technical contrasts (e.g., indexing strategies, recall/precision trade-offs, latency benchmarks).\n- The comparisons do not consistently and explicitly map methods to a common set of criteria such as modeling assumptions, data dependency, learning strategy (e.g., RL vs. SFT vs. meta-learning) across all classes; instead, these aspects appear in places but are not systematically tabulated or quantitatively contrasted.\n- Head-to-head comparisons with standardized metrics across representative methods are limited; the paper references tables (e.g., Table for sources/forms/operations) but the text primarily offers narrative comparisons without consolidated comparative summaries or quantitative benchmarks.\n\nOverall, the paper provides a clear and structured comparative analysis with multiple meaningful dimensions and explicit pros/cons, but it stops short of the most detailed, technical, and quantitatively grounded cross-method comparison expected for a full 5.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey delivers meaningful, technically grounded analytical commentary in several core sections, especially on memory forms, sources, and evaluation, but the depth is uneven across methods and some parts remain largely descriptive.\n\nStrong analytical reasoning and synthesis:\n- In “Memory Forms,” the paper goes beyond listing methods to explain underlying mechanisms and design trade-offs. For example, in “Complete Interactions,” it identifies fundamental causes for performance differences rooted in model architecture: “the fast-growing long-context memory … results in high computational cost during LLM inference, due to the quadratic growth of the time complexity of attention computation with sequence length… truncation … lost-in-the-middle… need to design extra memory modules.” This is a clear, technically grounded explanation of why storing all context can degrade robustness and efficiency.\n- In “Recent Interactions,” it articulates assumptions and limitations inherent in cache-like designs: “fails to access key information from distant memories… emphasizing on recency can inherently neglect earlier, yet critical information,” connecting design choices (locality principle) to failure modes (loss of distant but crucial context).\n- In “Retrieved Interactions,” it critically analyzes retrieval-based memory: “An inaccurate retrieval strategy can potentially acquire unrelated information… a heavy retrieval system can lead to large computational costs… for heterogeneous information outside the environment, it's difficult to directly apply the same method.” This shows awareness of retrieval quality, systems engineering trade-offs, and data heterogeneity constraints.\n- The subsection “External Knowledge” explicitly discusses reliability, bias, privacy/security, and alignment costs: “the reliability of this information can be questionable… integration of tools into agents demands a comprehensive understanding… higher computational costs… concerns regarding privacy, data security, and compliance,” demonstrating mature reflection beyond surface description.\n- The comparative synthesis in “Advantages and Disadvantages of Textual and Parametric Memory” offers crisp, insight-rich trade-offs: “Textual memory is more efficient in writing, while parametric memory is more efficient in reading,” and discusses effectiveness (token limits vs parameter density), efficiency (prompt integration vs training overhead), and interpretability (natural language vs latent space). This section meaningfully interprets why methodological differences arise and how they map to application needs.\n- In “What is the Memory…,” the unified formulation with W (writing), P (management), and R (reading) and the remark comparing how Reflexion and Generative Agents instantiate these (e.g., “in Reflexion, R and P are set as identical… in generative_agents, R is implemented based on similarity, time interval, and importance, and P is realized by a reflection process”) synthesizes relationships across lines of work and reveals design choices behind memory operations.\n- The evaluation section includes thoughtful process-level analysis (subjective evaluator selection, rating granularity) and a critical “Discussions” noting confounds in indirect evaluation (“performance on tasks can be attributed to various factors, and memory is only one of them”) and the lack of tailored benchmarks, which demonstrates reflective insight into methodological assessment.\n\nAreas where depth is uneven or more descriptive:\n- “Related Surveys” largely enumerates prior surveys by category (fundamental problems, evaluation, applications, challenges) without analyzing the causes of methodological differences or synthesizing cross-survey tensions. The commentary remains classificatory rather than interpretive (e.g., listing survey_llm_hallucination1–7, bias/fairness surveys, etc.).\n- “Memory Operations” (Writing/Management/Reading) provides representative studies and brief discussions but is lighter on mechanistic analysis and design trade-offs. For instance, “Most of the memory management operations are inspired by the working mechanism of human brains” and “the memory reading and writing operations are collaborative, and the forms of memory writing greatly influence the methods of memory reading” are accurate but relatively high-level; deeper technical contrasts (e.g., specific indexing schemas, update policies, interference and redundancy mitigation) are limited.\n- Future directions such as “Memory in LLM-based Multi-agent Applications,” “Lifelong Learning,” and “Memory in Humanoid Agent” offer insightful high-level reflections (e.g., synchronization, communication, information asymmetry; temporality and forgetting; human-aligned limitations) but lack detailed, technically grounded analysis of concrete mechanisms or comparative designs in existing MAS literature.\n\nOverall, the survey offers substantive critical analysis where it treats the core technical themes (memory forms, sources, evaluation frameworks, unified operations model), providing clear explanations of underlying causes, trade-offs, and limitations, and synthesizing across research threads. However, because some sections are predominantly descriptive and certain method areas are treated at a higher level, the depth is uneven—hence a score of 4 rather than 5.\n\nResearch guidance value:\nThe paper provides solid guidance for practitioners and researchers choosing memory architectures, especially through its comparative analysis of textual vs parametric memory, identification of key limitations (e.g., quadratic attention cost, retrieval accuracy/efficiency, catastrophic forgetting), and unified memory operation framework (W/P/R). Its evaluation discussion and future directions (parametric memory advances, MAS synchronization/communication, lifelong learning challenges) can inform research agendas, though more detailed, benchmark-oriented prescriptions and systematic ablation insights would further strengthen its guidance.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe “Limitations & Future Directions” section identifies several meaningful research gaps and offers a reasonable level of analysis for why they matter, but the treatment is uneven across dimensions and could go deeper on data/benchmarks and methodological roadmaps.\n\nStrengths and supporting parts:\n- More Advances in Parametric Memory (Section “Limitations & Future Directions” → “More Advances in Parametric Memory”):  \n  - The paper clearly motivates why parametric memory is important (efficiency, density, robustness, storage), e.g., “parametric memory boasts a higher information density… offers a richer expressive space… more storage-efficient” and that “parametric memory does not necessarily design manual rules like textual memory does, but can employ optimization methods to learn these processes implicitly.”  \n  - It identifies concrete challenges and their impact: “how to effectively transform textual information into parameters… time-consuming… unsuitable for situational knowledge,” and the “lack of interpretability… especially in domains requiring high levels of trust, such as medicine.” The proposed directions (meta-learning; e.g., citing MEND, MAC) link current achievements to future needs, showing methodological awareness and potential field impact (efficiency and trust-critical adoption).\n- Memory in LLM-based Multi-agent Applications (“Limitations & Future Directions” → “Memory in LLM-based Multi-agent Applications”):  \n  - It flags key open issues—“memory synchronization,” “communication,” and “information asymmetry”—and explains their importance to consistent decision-making and shared context (“fundamental for establishing a unified knowledge base… maintaining context and interpreting messages”). It also distinguishes cooperative versus competitive scenarios and anticipates impact on MAS design.\n- Memory-based Lifelong Learning (“Limitations & Future Directions” → “Memory-based Lifelong Learning”):  \n  - The section articulates why lifelong learning requires memory and highlights practical challenges: “temporality… memory overlap… vast amount of memories… retrieve… forgetting.” This frames methodological needs (temporal memory design, scalable storage/retrieval, forgetting mechanisms) and their effect on long-term agent performance.\n- Memory in Humanoid Agent (“Limitations & Future Directions” → “Memory in Humanoid Agent”):  \n  - It emphasizes cognitive fidelity as a gap—“should align with human cognitive processes, adhering to… memory distortion and forgetfulness,” and “knowledge boundaries.” This is important for realism and social simulation validity.\n\nLimitations reducing the score:\n- Limited coverage of data/benchmarks: While the paper notes earlier that “to our knowledge, there are no open-sourced benchmarks tailored for the memory modules in LLM-based agents” (Section “How to Evaluate the Memory in LLM-based Agent” → “Discussions”), the Future Directions section does not explicitly elevate this into a concrete research gap with proposed actions (e.g., standardized datasets, evaluation protocols, metrics for memory effectiveness, or reproducible benchmarking suites).\n- Methodological depth varies:  \n  - The MAS and lifelong learning subsections remain high-level, lacking detailed methodological paths (e.g., algorithms for memory synchronization, formal models for communication-context retention, scalable indexing schemes for lifelong memory, conflict-resolution across multi-source memories).  \n  - The humanoid agent subsection is primarily conceptual; it does not discuss operationalization (e.g., psychometric validation, metrics for human-likeness in memory distortion/forgetting, or controlled experiments).\n- Other important gaps are not fully addressed: safety/privacy of memory (especially with external tools/APIs), provenance and integrity of multi-source memory, contradiction resolution across sources, domain adaptation and continual updates of domain knowledge, and practical resource constraints are only tangentially covered or omitted.\n\nOverall, the section identifies several major gaps, connects them to current achievements, and discusses their importance and potential impacts, particularly for parametric memory. However, the analysis is uneven and lacks deeper development in benchmarks/data and concrete methodological proposals across all areas, leading to a score of 4 rather than 5.", "4\n\nExplanation:\n- The survey proposes several forward-looking research directions grounded in identified gaps and real-world needs, but many of the directions remain high-level and lack fully actionable, detailed paths, so the analysis of potential impact and innovation is somewhat shallow.\n\nEvidence by section and specific statements:\n- Limitations & Future Directions → “More Advances in Parametric Memory”\n  - Clear gap identification: “parametric memory… is still under-researched” and challenges with “efficiency: how to effectively transform textual information into parameters…”; “SFT… is time-consuming and requires extensive text corpus, making it unsuitable for situational knowledge.”\n  - Forward-looking suggestions tied to real-world needs: proposes “pluggable parametric memory” and “employ meta-learning to let models learn to memorize,” citing MAC and MEND; highlights trust and interpretability in high-stakes domains: “lack of interpretability… can be a hindrance, especially in domains requiring high levels of trust, such as medicine… enhancing the credibility and interpretability of parametric memory is an urgent issue.”\n  - Strength: This integrates gaps (efficiency, interpretability, suitability for online scenarios) with plausible research directions (meta-learning, parametric adaptation), and connects to real-world needs (medical trustworthiness). Weakness: It stops short of specifying concrete methodologies, benchmarks, or evaluation protocols to make the path fully actionable.\n\n- Limitations & Future Directions → “Memory in LLM-based Multi-agent Applications”\n  - Gap and need identification: “memory synchronization among agents… fundamental for establishing a unified knowledge base”; “communication… relies on memory for maintaining context”; “competitive scenarios… information asymmetry becomes a crucial issue.”\n  - Forward-looking direction: “exploration of novel memory modules that can further enhance agent synchronization, enable more effective communication, and provide strategic advantages.”\n  - Strength: Clearly ties to real-world MAS needs (coordination, communication, asymmetry). Weakness: The recommendations are broad; no detailed mechanisms (e.g., synchronization protocols, consistency models, or privacy-preserving memory sharing strategies) or impact analyses.\n\n- Limitations & Future Directions → “Memory-based Lifelong Learning”\n  - Gap and need identification: positions memory as key to lifelong learning in long-term applications (social simulation, personal assistance).\n  - Challenges outlined: “temporality… memory overlap… store a vast amount of memories… incorporate a certain mechanism for forgetting.”\n  - Strength: Identifies concrete pain points in real-world long-horizon settings. Weakness: Lacks specific proposals (e.g., time-aware retrieval architectures, scalable storage/forgetting strategies) and does not analyze academic/practical impact in depth.\n\n- Limitations & Future Directions → “Memory in Humanoid Agent”\n  - Real-world alignment: “memory… should align with human cognitive processes, adhering to psychological principles such as memory distortion and forgetfulness,” and “knowledge boundaries… an agent embodying a child should not possess… advanced mathematical concepts.”\n  - Strength: Presents a forward-looking, human-centered research direction that maps to social simulation and role-play needs. Weakness: Suggestions are conceptual without specific research designs or metrics to assess human-likeness, distortion, or bounded knowledge.\n\nOverall justification for score:\n- The survey identifies multiple key gaps and ties them to concrete real-world needs across domains (medicine, multi-agent systems, long-term assistants, humanoid simulation). It offers new research topics and suggestions (parametric memory via meta-learning; synchronized and communication-aware memory in MAS; temporal and forgetting mechanisms for lifelong learning; human-aligned memory characteristics).\n- However, it does not provide a thorough analysis of academic and practical impact for each direction, nor clear, actionable research paths (e.g., proposed architectures, datasets/benchmarks, evaluation metrics, or deployment considerations). This fits the 4-point description: innovative and forward-looking but with shallow analysis of impact and limited actionable detail."]}
