{"name": "G", "paperour": [4, 5, 4, 5, 4, 3, 4], "reason": ["Score: 4/5\n\nExplanation:\n- Research Objective Clarity:\n  - The paper clearly states its objective and scope in the Introduction: “This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of deep neural network pruning for diverse readers. We review representative pruning methods, propose a new taxonomy, conduct a comprehensive analysis… and give practitioners… recommendations…” This sentence explicitly frames the survey’s purpose (overview), approach (taxonomy + comparative analysis), and audience (researchers and practitioners).\n  - The contributions are enumerated in a focused list—“Our contributions are as follows: (1) Comprehensive review… (2) Comparative experiments and analysis… (3) Collection of abundant resources… (4) Recommendations and future directions.” This breakdown is specific and actionable, making the research direction and deliverables clear.\n  - The organization of the paper is outlined at the end of the Introduction (“The remainder of this survey is organized as follows…”), which reinforces the clarity of the research path.\n\n- Background and Motivation:\n  - The Introduction provides a thorough and relevant background that motivates the survey:\n    - It articulates the growth in model size and practical constraints (“ResNet-50… 23 million parameters… BERT… 110 million… GPT-3… 175 billion… The high training and inference costs… present a significant challenge… deployment on devices constrained by limited computational resources…”).\n    - It links pruning to real-world needs (“autonomous driving, field rescue, bushfire prevention necessitate… fast real-time response and compact memory footprint” and the impracticality on edge devices).\n    - It situates pruning among other compression techniques (quantization, distillation, low-rank, NAS) and justifies why pruning merits a dedicated, in-depth survey.\n    - It critically surveys prior reviews and identifies gaps (“many of them… focus on multiple compression techniques… with only brief examination… focus only on structured pruning… lack descriptions for RNNs, Transformers, diffusion models…”). This makes the motivation for a more comprehensive and experimentally grounded pruning survey convincing.\n\n- Practical Significance and Guidance Value:\n  - The paper emphasizes practical utility through multiple elements:\n    - A new taxonomy designed to help users choose among methods (“we establish a new taxonomy… as shown in Fig.~Fig:pruning-taxonomy”).\n    - Comparative experiments and analysis specifically aimed at practice (“eight pairs of contrast settings… pruning for LLMs and different supervision levels…”), which is uncommon in surveys and adds applied value.\n    - A “Collection of abundant resources,” including datasets, networks, and evaluations (Appendix D) and a maintained GitHub repository for ongoing updates. These are strong indicators of guidance value for practitioners.\n    - The promise of “Recommendations and future directions” explicitly addresses decision-making in real-world deployments.\n\n- Reasons for not awarding 5/5:\n  - The Abstract text is not provided in the excerpt (the LaTeX shows abstract-related commands, but the actual abstract content is absent). Without an accessible abstract, the clarity of the objective at the very beginning of the paper cannot be fully evaluated, which slightly reduces overall clarity for first-time readers.\n  - While the objectives are clear and specific, the Introduction could further benefit from briefly articulating explicit research questions or guiding themes (e.g., “Which pruning paradigms perform best under which constraints?”) to sharpen the direction even more. The claims such as “the most comprehensive overview” are strong; although they motivate ambition, they would benefit from succinct empirical justification in the Abstract to avoid overstatement.\n\nOverall, the Introduction excels at defining the survey’s purpose, motivation, and practical contributions. The absence of the abstract content in the provided text is the main factor preventing a perfect score.", "5\n\nExplanation:\n- Method classification clarity: The survey establishes a clear, well-motivated taxonomy anchored on three orthogonal questions, which are explicitly stated at the beginning of “Taxonomy”: “There are three critical questions when pruning a deep neural network. (1) Whether to achieve universal or specific acceleration… (2) When to prune the neural network? … (3) Whether to prune based on specific criteria or learn to prune?” This framing yields three primary axes that are consistently used to organize methods throughout the paper. The clarity is reinforced by:\n  - Formal definitions and granularity: “Definition 1 (Unstructured Pruning)” and “Definition 2 (Structured Pruning)” provide concise mathematical formulations, demonstrating rigor and making category boundaries precise. “Semi-structured Pruning” is distinguished with concrete patterns (e.g., 2:4, 4:8) and hardware implications, showing how this class fits between unstructured and structured from a speedup perspective.\n  - Clear timing pipelines: “When to Prune” separates PBT, PDT, PAT and run-time pruning, with a figure (“The typical pipelines of static pruning”) and concrete examples. The paper further structures PDT into four paradigms (“We summarize the main prior solutions into four paradigms: (1) sparsity regularization based, (2) dynamic sparse training based, (3) score-based, and (4) differentiable pruning based”), which gives a lucid sub-taxonomy inside PDT.\n  - Criteria vs. learning: “Pruning Criteria” explicitly categorizes magnitude, norm, sensitivity/saliency, and loss-change (first-order and second-order Taylor), while “Learn to Prune” systematically presents sparsity-regularization, meta-learning, graph-based, and reinforcement learning based approaches. This separation of “how to decide” (criteria) and “how to learn” (learning-based) aligns with the third question in the taxonomy and keeps the classification consistent.\n\n- Evolution of methodology: The survey effectively traces and explains the progression of pruning research across architectures and eras, making trends explicit and systematic.\n  - Historical trajectory: In “Introduction,” it notes early work (1988) and the pivotal modern resurgence with “han2015deep,” setting the stage for evolution. The “LTH and its Variants” section provides a structured historical map of one of the most influential lines—organizing follow-ups into five classes: stronger hypotheses; transferability; generalization to other contexts; theoretical justification; revisiting and questioning LTH. This shows how a major idea evolves technically and theoretically.\n  - From CNNs to Transformers and LLMs: Multiple sections articulate the shift in context and techniques. “Pruning Before Training” observes PBT is “primarily targets CNNs,” while “Pruning After Training” and “Post-Training Pruning” highlight the recent emergence of efficient post-training strategies for large models (e.g., SparseGPT 2023; Wanda 2024; SliceGPT 2024), and explain why retraining is often avoided at large scale. The survey also extends to diffusion models and multimodal systems (e.g., “Diff-Pruning” for diffusion, “UPop” for multimodal), evidencing the field’s expansion.\n  - Hardware-aware patterns and universal vs. specific speedup: The “Specific or Universal Speedup” section connects pruning granularity to hardware/software requirements, noting that only structured pruning yields universal acceleration, while semi-structured leverages patterns (e.g., NVIDIA Ampere 2:4) for specific acceleration. This demonstrates the evolution from purely accuracy-focused pruning toward system-aware, deployment-focused design.\n  - Methodological trends via comparative contrasts: “A Comprehensive Comparative Analysis” presents eight key contrasts (e.g., Unstructured vs. Structured; One-shot vs. Iterative; Data-free vs. Data-driven; Initialized vs. Pre-trained; Global vs. Local; Training from Scratch vs. Fine-tuning; Original vs. Transfer; Static vs. Dynamic), backed by experiments and literature citations. These contrasts synthesize where and why newer methods outperform older ones, reflecting practice-driven evolution (e.g., iterative generally outperforming one-shot; data-driven outperforming data-free in PAT for LLMs; fine-tuning typically better than training from scratch for modern architectures).\n  - Layer-wise density and supervision level: The “Layer-wise Weight Density Analysis” and “Pruning with Different Levels of Supervision” sections show nuanced, emergent understandings—e.g., non-uniform sparsity allocations in LLMs, early observations for CNNs vs. Transformers (different distribution patterns), and increasing roles of self-/semi-/unsupervised pruning—indicative of methodological maturation.\n  - Fusion and future: “Fusion of Pruning and other Compression Techniques” systematically reviews how pruning combines with quantization, decomposition, KD, and NAS, showing integrative trends. “Suggestions and Future Directions” further points to AutoML/NAS-driven pruning, energy-aware pruning, hardware integration, and standardized evaluation—signaling anticipated evolutionary directions.\n\n- Specific textual support:\n  - “We provide a new taxonomy of deep neural network pruning…” and the accompanying figures (taxonomy and pipelines) support classification clarity and consistency.\n  - The formal definitions in “Unstructured Pruning” and “Structured Pruning” and the semi-structured examples (2:4 pattern leveraging Nvidia Ampere) ground categories.\n  - “We summarize the main prior solutions into four paradigms” in PDT is an explicit, systematic structuring of method evolution inside that pipeline.\n  - The “LTH and its Variants” section’s five-part organization shows a thoughtful meta-analysis of how a core idea diversified and advanced.\n  - “Post-Training Pruning” highlights the very recent shift to large-scale, no-retraining strategies—SparseGPT, Wanda, SliceGPT—capturing a clear evolutionary trend in the field driven by LLM deployment constraints.\n  - The eight contrasts in “A Comprehensive Comparative Analysis” illustrate how the field learned and moved toward more effective designs across dimensions, supported by experiments.\n  - “Fusion of Pruning…” and “Future Directions” articulate integrative and prospective paths, underscoring both current technological convergence and expected trajectories.\n\n- Minor limitations (do not materially reduce the score):\n  - The paper could include a chronological timeline figure mapping key milestones to help novices see the temporal evolution at a glance.\n  - Some categories overlap (e.g., semi-structured described as fine-grained under structured), which may require careful reading; however, the text clarifies these distinctions and their hardware implications.\n\nOverall, the survey achieves a clear, multi-axis classification and presents the evolution of pruning methods across architectures, scales, and methodological paradigms in a systematic and well-referenced manner, meriting a score of 5.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\n- Diversity of datasets and metrics:\n  - The survey covers a broad range of application domains and their canonical datasets and metrics, demonstrating strong breadth.\n    - Computer Vision: Image classification (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet), object detection (COCO, PASCAL VOC), semantic segmentation, human-pose estimation, image deraining, image super-resolution, tracking, and generative modeling (DDPMs/LDMs on CIFAR-10, CelebA-HQ, LSUN Church). See “Pruning for Specific Applications” and the associated subsections (Image Classification, Object Detection, Image Style Translation, Other CV Tasks, Generative tasks).\n    - NLP: Machine translation (WMT’14/16, OpenSubtitles2018), natural language understanding (GLUE tasks such as SST-2, QNLI, QQP, MNLI; SQuAD), language modeling (WikiText-2, PTB), and large language model evaluations (BoolQ, PIQA, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, MMLU). See “Natural Language Processing” and the LLM results table in “More Comparison Results” and “Experimental settings.”\n    - Speech/audio: TED-LIUM, Common Voice, LibriSpeech, with WER/CER. See “Audio and Speech Processing.”\n    - Vision-and-language: COCO, Flickr30K with VQA and image-text retrieval metrics. See “Vision-and-Language Tasks.”\n  - Metrics are equally diverse and appropriate for each task:\n    - CV metrics: Top-1/Top-5 accuracy, mAP, COCO mAP, SSIM, FID, FCN-scores. See “Pruning for Specific Applications” subsections and the summary table “Summary of commonly used pruning evaluation metrics for various applications.”\n    - NLP metrics: BLEU, accuracy, Pearson/Matthews correlation, F1, perplexity. See “Natural Language Processing” and the summary table.\n    - LLM metrics: Perplexity, common sense benchmarks (BoolQ, PIQA, HellaSwag, WinoGrande), and MMLU. See “Experimental settings” (LLM evaluation paragraph) and the large LLM table in “More Comparison Results.”\n    - Speech metrics: WER/CER (with formula given). See “Audio and Speech Processing.”\n    - Efficiency metrics across domains: FLOPs, MACs, sparsity, and speedup definitions (see “Terms and Notations,” which clearly defines FLOPs, MACs, prune/compression/sparsity ratios, and speedup ratio).\n  - The paper provides a consolidated summary table (“Summary of commonly used pruning evaluation metrics for various applications”), mapping tasks to datasets, models, performance metrics, and efficiency measures, which strongly supports diversity coverage.\n\n- Rationality of datasets and metrics:\n  - The choices align well with standard practice in each subfield:\n    - Image classification uses Top-1/Top-5 accuracy; object detection uses mAP/COCO mAP; generative tasks use FID/SSIM; speech uses WER/CER; translation uses BLEU; language modeling uses perplexity; LLM reasoning uses common sense benchmarks and MMLU. These are academically standard and practically meaningful. See the respective subsections under “Pruning for Specific Applications.”\n  - The “Experimental settings” section gives concrete dataset scales and training details for CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet (e.g., “ImageNet includes over 1.28 million training and 50K validation images…”, learning rate schedules, epochs), which shows care in rational experimental design.\n  - For LLMs, the survey explains sequence lengths (128 vs 2048) in the LLM table and evaluates zero-shot perplexity and reasoning tasks (“Experimental settings” and the LLM comparison table), which are reasonable settings for post-training pruning scenarios.\n  - The survey explicitly acknowledges comparability challenges and calls for standardized benchmarks beyond image classification (see “Future Directions – Evaluation”), showing awareness of metric applicability and fairness issues.\n\n- Reasons it is 4 and not 5:\n  - While coverage is very broad and generally well-motivated, detailed descriptions of dataset scales and labeling protocols are only provided for a few datasets (notably CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet in “Experimental settings”). Many other datasets are listed without specifics on scale, annotation schema, or splits (e.g., COCO, GLUE tasks, Flickr30K, LibriSpeech).\n  - The paper rarely discusses limitations or caveats of certain metrics (e.g., known issues with FID and BLEU, or perplexity’s relation to downstream LLM utility), and does not consistently report or analyze real hardware speedups/latency across pruning settings despite defining efficiency metrics (“Terms and Notations” focuses on theoretical FLOPs/MACs).\n  - Energy-aware evaluation is referenced (ECC and the need for energy-aware pruning in “Fusion of Pruning and other Compression Techniques” and “Future Directions – Techniques”), but concrete energy metrics and standardized reporting are not integrated into the main experiments.\n\nOverall, the survey earns a 4 for dataset and metric coverage: it spans many domains with appropriate, standard metrics and includes a useful summary table and detailed experimental setups for core benchmarks. It falls short of a perfect score mainly due to incomplete detail on dataset scales/labeling for many tasks and limited critical discussion of metric limitations and real-world efficiency reporting.", "Score: 5\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey delivers a systematic, well-structured, and technically grounded comparison of pruning methods across multiple meaningful dimensions, supported by formal definitions, equations, and targeted experimental contrasts. The following elements from the paper substantiate this score.\n\n- Clear, multi-dimensional taxonomy that frames the comparative analysis:\n  - In “Taxonomy,” the authors pose three core questions—specific vs. universal speedup, when to prune (before/during/after training vs. run-time), and criteria-based vs. learning-based pruning—and use these to structure the entire review (“There are three critical questions when pruning a deep neural network… The answers to the three questions correspond to the three primary aspects…”). This provides an explicit comparative scaffold across modeling perspective, hardware dependency, timing, and learning strategy.\n\n- Rigorous definitions and technical grounding:\n  - “Unstructured Pruning” provides a formal constrained optimization formulation (Eq. for L0-constrained loss minimization) and its practical mask-based variant for small/medium models, clarifying assumptions and implementation choices. \n  - “Structured Pruning” gives a set-based definition over channels/filters/heads/layers and discusses reconstruction implications.\n  - “Pruning Criteria” subdivides criteria into magnitude, norms, sensitivity/saliency, and loss change, and supplies first- and second-order Taylor expansions (e.g., “The loss change is usually approximated… The first-order Taylor expansion… The second-order Taylor expansion…” and specific instantiations for filters/channels).\n  - “Learn to Prune” details objective formulations for sparsity regularization, meta-learning (PruningNet mapping encoding vectors to weights), graph-based aggregation for mask generation, and reinforcement learning with reward definitions, highlighting the different optimization objectives and mechanisms.\n\n- Explicit advantages, disadvantages, and trade-offs:\n  - Specific vs. universal speedup: “Only structured pruning can achieve universal neural network acceleration… Conversely, both unstructured and semi-structured pruning need the support of special hardware or software.” Semi-structured is positioned as a middle ground with patterns like 2:4 that trade flexibility and accuracy for hardware-accelerated speed.\n  - When to prune (PBT/PDT/PAT): The pipeline figures and text delineate cost and benefits (e.g., PBT “eliminate the cost of pre-training,” PDT paradigms clarify sparse-to-sparse vs. dense-to-sparse, and PAT emphasizes the standard Pretrain-Prune-Retrain loop). They note practical issues like layer collapse risks in one-shot settings, and dynamic sparse training’s impact on gradient flow (“evci2022gradeint… sparse networks have poor gradient flow at initialization, but dynamic sparse training significantly improves gradient flow”).\n  - One-shot vs. iterative: In “A Comprehensive Comparative Analysis,” the authors contrast accuracy vs. computational cost, explain the stochastic gradient rationale (“iterative pruning computes a stochastic gradient at the pruned model… one-shot computes… at the original weights”), and support it with both theory (“surrogate loss landscape only holds locally”) and experiments.\n  - Data-free vs. data-driven: They explicitly compare outcomes across CNNs and LLMs, noting SynFlow vs. SNIP/GraSP in PBT and the consistent superiority of data-driven PAT for LLMs.\n  - Global vs. local: They analyze layerwise magnitude variability, outliers (“some outlier features may have magnitudes up to 20 times larger”), and practical implications for LLMs; they cite emerging global methods and argue why local pruning may be suboptimal.\n  - Training-from-scratch vs. fine-tuning: They synthesize mixed evidence from prior work and provide their own experiments, concluding that fine-tuning generally wins, especially on ImageNet.\n  - Static vs. dynamic: They contrast criteria and deployment models and acknowledge the absence of run-time retraining for dynamic methods.\n  - Initialized vs. pre-trained: They describe differing robustness to mask/value ablations in CNNs and pre-training necessity in Transformers, backed by their experiments.\n\n- Identification of commonalities and distinctions:\n  - The survey consistently groups methods by shared principles (e.g., sparsity regularization vs. score-based vs. differentiable pruning in PDT; magnitude vs. saliency vs. Taylor-based criteria in PAT).\n  - It highlights architectural distinctions (CNNs: channels/filters vs. Transformers: attention heads/tokens; LLMs’ outlier dimensions; diffusion-model specifics) and objective differences (robustness vs. efficiency vs. energy-aware goals).\n  - It notes assumptions and constraints (hardware/software support for irregular sparsity; requirement of calibration data for many Transformer/LLM pruning methods; pre-training dependence for large models).\n\n- Avoidance of superficial listing and presence of structured comparative tables:\n  - Multiple tables summarize representative methods with attributes like criterion, unstructured/structured, data-driven or data-free, one-shot or iterative, retrain required, etc. For example, “Representative methods of pruning before training” and “Representative methods of pruning during training/after training” synthesize method properties in a way that enables direct comparison.\n  - The “A Comprehensive Comparative Analysis” section explicitly sets up eight pairs of contrast settings and discusses them with supporting figures and cited results, moving beyond mere enumeration to reasoned comparison.\n\n- Examples of specific sentences and sections supporting the above:\n  - Specific vs. universal speedup: “Since it can remove weights anywhere, the irregular replacement of non-zero weights leads to actual acceleration requiring the support of special software… Therefore, we classify unstructured pruning as a specific speedup technique” and “Structured pruning… does not require the support of special hardware and software… and can directly speed up networks…”\n  - One-shot vs. iterative: “Iterative pruning generally performs better… more iterations tend to yield better performance” and the stochastic gradient explanation in that subsection.\n  - Data-free vs. data-driven: “SynFlow and SNIP are similarly effective… SynFlow significantly outperforming GraSP, indicating that… effectiveness of PBT methods is not strictly dependent on data usage… In contrast… data-driven PAT methods typically outperform data-free PAT methods.”\n  - Global vs. local: “Global pruning poses great challenges, particularly for LLMs, due to significant variations in layer magnitudes… leading to incomparability issues,” and evidence about newly proposed global approaches.\n  - Training vs. fine-tuning: “fine-tuning generally outperforms training from scratch… Notably, on ImageNet, fine-tuning achieves significantly higher accuracy.”\n  - Criteria comparisons: Detailed derivations under “Loss Change” and contrasting of first- vs second-order approximations; “Magnitude-based Pruning” and “lp Norm” subsections delineate overlapping yet distinct scoring perspectives.\n\nCollectively, these elements demonstrate a comprehensive and structured comparative review, with clear articulation of advantages, disadvantages, commonalities, distinctions, architectural and assumption-based differences, and method properties across multiple dimensions, supported by formal rigor and empirical contrasts.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe survey provides meaningful, technically grounded analytical interpretation across multiple pruning lines, but the depth is uneven and several sections remain primarily descriptive. Below are specific places where the paper clearly goes beyond summary to explain mechanisms, trade-offs, and underlying causes, as well as areas where analysis is thinner.\n\nEvidence of strong critical analysis and interpretive insight:\n\n- Taxonomy and hardware/software trade-offs (Specific or Universal Speedup). The paper explicitly reasons about acceleration feasibility and the structural causes behind it:\n  - “Only structured pruning can achieve universal neural network acceleration without requiring special hardware or software. Conversely, both unstructured and semi-structured pruning need the support of special hardware or software.” (Taxonomy)\n  - “Since it can remove weights anywhere, the irregular replacement of non-zero weights leads to actual acceleration requiring the support of special software and/or hardware… Therefore, we classify unstructured pruning as a specific speedup technique.” (Unstructured Pruning)\n  These lines connect form factor (irregular sparsity vs. structured removal) to implementation constraints and practical acceleration realities, giving a cause-based explanation rather than merely listing methods.\n\n- Mechanistic discussion of semi-structured patterns and device-level assumptions:\n  - “SparseGPT… introduces a 2:4 or 4:8 sparsity pattern… The 2:4 pattern can utilize NVIDIA Ampere GPU’s sparse tensor cores to accelerate matrix multiplication.” (Semi-structured Pruning)\n  This ties pruning granularity to architectural support and shows the dependency assumptions required for speedups.\n\n- Explanations of PBT feasibility and failure modes:\n  - “tanaka2020pruning… propose… SynFlow… avoid layer collapse through gradual pruning.” (Pruning Before Training)\n  - “wang2020picking propose Gradient Signal Preservation (GraSP)… to remove weights that have the least effect on the gradient flow.” (Pruning Before Training)\n  - “ma2021sanity provide a more rigorous definition of LTH… find that whether and when the winning tickets can be identified highly relies on the training settings… It is more likely to find winning tickets by using a small learning rate or an insufficient number of training epochs.” (LTH and its Variants)\n  These statements identify underlying phenomena (gradient flow, layer collapse, dynamical isometry, and sensitivity to learning rate/training duration) that drive differences between methods; they are interpretive and mechanism-oriented.\n\n- Technical grounding via Taylor expansions and loss-change analysis:\n  - “The loss change is usually approximated in a Taylor expansion-based way… The first-order Taylor expansion is the most commonly used… The second-order Taylor expansion… includes the first-order (gradient) term, the second-order (Hessian) term…” (Loss Change, Pruning Criteria)\n  - “nonnenmacher2022sosp… Second-order Structured Pruning (SOSP) to selectively zero out filter masks to minimize the effects of the loss change…” (Other score-based Methods)\n  These sections explain not just what criteria are used but why (local approximations to the objective), giving a principled view of method differences.\n\n- Insight into dynamic sparse training and gradient flow:\n  - “evci2022gradeint analyze the reasonability of dynamic sparse training and find that sparse networks have poor gradient flow at initialization, but dynamic sparse training significantly improves gradient flow.” (Dynamic Sparse Training based Methods)\n  This is a direct mechanism-level interpretation connecting training dynamics to method effectiveness.\n\n- Reasoned classification and critique of LTH:\n  - “It is worth pointing out that… LTH is classified as a PBT method… However, LTH selects masks based on a pre-trained network… Therefore, it is more reasonable to classify LTH as a PAT method.” (LTH and its Variants)\n  This shows reflective commentary and careful reconciliation of definitions—an analytical stance rather than a passive summary.\n\n- Post-training pruning design trade-offs:\n  - “post-training pruning methods simplify the three-step process… pruning a pre-trained model without retraining, typically achieving negligible accuracy loss by using compensation mechanisms… SparseGPT… tackles the pruning problem as an approximate sparsity reconstruction problem… To address SparseGPT’s reconstruction cost, Wanda uses weight magnitudes and input norms…” (Post-Training Pruning)\n  These sentences explicitly discuss time/compute trade-offs, reconstruction approximations, and differing cost structures across algorithms.\n\n- Run-time pruning and input-conditioned capacity:\n  - “This line of work is based on the premise that… task difficulty… varies, implying that necessary model capacities for different inputs are different… generate different subnetworks for each instance… only channels with saliencies larger than the threshold need to be computed…” (Run-time Pruning)\n  This explains the core assumption and mechanistic behavior of dynamic pruning.\n\nWhere the analysis is weaker or more descriptive:\n\n- Several subsections largely enumerate methods and results without deeply engaging with fundamental causes, limitations, or design trade-offs. For example:\n  - “Learn to Prune” (Sparsity Regularization, Meta-Learning, GNN-based, RL-based): These parts primarily present formulations and workflows, with limited interpretive commentary on when/why these approaches work best or fail (e.g., optimization stability, search space pathologies, overfitting to proxies).\n  - “Pruning Criteria” (Magnitude, lp norm, Sensitivity/Saliency): While technically grounded, much of the content is definitional and formulaic. There is minimal discussion of when magnitude-based assumptions break (e.g., outliers, scale differences across layers), or the brittleness of local Taylor approximations across architectures prior to the later experimental comparisons.\n  - “When to Prune” contains informative taxonomy and motivations, but parts like “PDT methods have been less explored due to the more complicated dynamic process” are surface-level; deeper causal examinations (e.g., optimization non-stationarity, mask-update noise, convergence guarantees) are not fully developed.\n\n- Depth unevenness across modalities: The survey does connect CV, NLP, ViTs, and LLMs, but the mechanistic synthesis is stronger for CNN pruning and for certain Transformer cases (e.g., post-training LLM pruning) than for other areas (e.g., RL-based pruning or meta-learning), where the analysis tilts toward cataloging.\n\nOverall judgment:\n\nThe paper merits 4 points because it consistently offers analytical reasoning in key sections, explaining hardware dependencies, training dynamics (gradient flow, layer collapse), principled loss-change approximations, and practical trade-offs (cost vs. retraining). It also includes reflective classification decisions (e.g., LTH as PAT) and cross-domain synthesis (CNNs to LLMs). However, the depth is not uniform: multiple method-focused subsections remain largely descriptive, and some limitations or assumptions could be interrogated more systematically. Hence, it falls short of a fully “deep, across-the-board” 5-point critical analysis but clearly exceeds basic summary-level commentary.", "Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe paper does articulate several future directions and open problems, but the treatment is largely high-level and brief, with limited depth on why each gap matters and what concrete impacts it has. The identification spans multiple dimensions (theory, techniques/systems, applications, evaluation), which is good breadth, but key “data-centric” gaps and deeper analyses of implications are missing or only lightly touched. Below are specifics, with pointers to the relevant parts of the manuscript:\n\nWhat the paper does well (breadth of gaps identified):\n- Section “Suggestions and Future Directions” → “Future Directions”\n  - Theories: The paper explicitly poses foundational open questions, e.g., “Does a theoretical upper bound of the prune ratio exist for a given network…? … how heavily can a network be pruned theoretically without accuracy loss?” and “is pruning explainable?” It also notes why these are hard (“intricate relationships between network layers”) and why important (“interpretability of pruning is vital for understanding the factors behind pruning”). This shows awareness of key theoretical gaps.\n  - Techniques: The paper identifies multiple systems/algorithmic avenues: extending AutoML/NAS to pruning; combining pruning with lifelong/continual/contrastive/federated learning; energy-aware pruning; and hardware co-design/“hardware-friendly pruning.” It highlights a specific shortcoming—“preliminary efforts mainly focus on reducing computation and memory costs, which may not necessarily reduce the most energy consumption”—which is a concrete and pertinent gap.\n  - Applications: It flags the growing importance of pruning for “more complex applications” and foundation models (e.g., GPT-4), noting that “its enormous size hinders its application in many downstream tasks.” This correctly motivates work on large models and practical deployment.\n  - Evaluation: It calls for “standardized benchmarks and metrics… to provide a fair evaluation” beyond image classification, pointing out current results are “incomparable” due to diverse settings, and mentions ShrinkBench as an initial effort. This is an important community-level gap.\n\nWhy this does not reach a higher score (limited depth and missing dimensions):\n- Depth of analysis and impact:\n  - While the paper lists the gaps, it rarely elaborates on their downstream impact, trade-offs, or concrete research pathways. For example, for theory it poses big questions (upper bounds, explainability) but does not discuss how answering them might alter pruning method design, reliability, or deployment decisions (e.g., stopping criteria, certification).\n  - For techniques, energy-aware pruning is rightly raised, but the discussion stops at the observation that FLOPs/MACs are poor proxies for energy. There is no deeper analysis of measurement methodology (e.g., on-device energy profiling, system heterogeneity), model–compiler–hardware interactions, or standardization needs—points that would clarify impact on real-world deployment.\n  - For evaluation, the need for standardized benchmarks is identified, but there is limited exploration of what such benchmarks should include (e.g., calibration-data regimes for LLM post-training pruning, long-context scenarios, dynamic/run-time pruning protocols, latency/throughput under different batch sizes, hardware diversity), or how to handle reproducibility and reporting standards. This constrains the practical impact of the recommendation.\n- Data-centric gaps are underdeveloped in the future work section:\n  - Earlier, the paper discusses “Pruning with Different Levels of Supervision” (supervised, semi-/self-/unsupervised) and shows awareness of data availability issues. However, the Future Directions section does not elevate data-specific open problems, such as: calibration data selection for post-training pruning of LLMs and diffusion models; domain shift and non-IID data in federated or continual scenarios; data privacy constraints; label scarcity and weak supervision; or robust pruning under distribution shift. This leaves the “data” dimension comparatively thin in the forward-looking analysis.\n- Safety, robustness, and reliability:\n  - Although the survey has a dedicated “Adversarial Robustness” application section (and notes risks earlier), the Future Directions section does not turn these into explicit research gaps (e.g., certified pruning guarantees, stability under run-time/dynamic pruning, trade-offs between sparsity and robustness for large models). The omission reduces the depth of the gap analysis on a critical topic.\n\nConcrete supporting places in the text:\n- Future Directions overview: “We discuss four promising directions… (1) theories, (2) techniques, (3) applications, and (4) evaluation.”\n- Theoretical gaps: “Does a theoretical upper bound of the prune ratio exist…? … how heavily can a network be pruned…? … is pruning explainable? … interpretability of pruning is vital…” \n- Technical gaps (systems/energy/hardware): “extend AutoML and NAS to pruning… combine with lifelong learning, continual learning, contrast learning, and federated learning… rising energy consumption… preliminary efforts mainly focus on reducing computation and memory costs, which may not necessarily reduce the most energy consumption… incorporating pruning into hardware… a hardware-friendly pruning method… deploy on an FPGA…”\n- Applications/large models: “Foundation models such as GPT-4… enormous size hinders its application… more pruning methods will enable colossal foundation models…”\n- Evaluation/benchmarks: “standardized benchmarks and metrics are required… different pruning techniques… lead to incomparable results… ShrinkBench… standardized benchmarks and metrics for other applications are needed.”\n\nSummary judgment:\n- The paper identifies a range of meaningful gaps across theory, techniques/systems, applications, and evaluation, but the analysis is generally brief and does not deeply unpack the importance, consequences, or actionable research plans for each gap. It also underemphasizes data-centric future challenges and does not explicitly carry over safety/robustness into the future-work agenda. Therefore, it best matches the rubric’s description for 3 points: some gaps are listed, but the depth of analysis and impact discussion are limited.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\n- The paper’s “Suggestions and Future Directions” section explicitly identifies multiple research gaps and proposes forward-looking directions that align with real-world needs, but the analysis remains relatively high-level and does not deeply develop the expected academic/practical impact or a concrete, actionable research roadmap—hence a score of 4 rather than 5.\n\nSupporting parts:\n- Clear identification of theoretical gaps and forward-looking questions:\n  - In “Future Directions – Theories,” the paper asks, “Does a theoretical upper bound of the prune ratio exist for a given network that still maintains the performance of its dense equivalent?” and “Is pruning explainable?” These are well-defined, forward-looking research questions targeting core open issues (theoretical limits, interpretability). They directly address foundational gaps in the field.\n- Directions tied to real-world constraints and deployment:\n  - In “Future Directions – Techniques,” the paper calls to “extend Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) methods and NAS to pruning,” and to integrate pruning with “lifelong learning, continual learning, contrast learning, and federated learning.” This reflects the need to make pruning adaptive and scalable in practical scenarios (e.g., continual/federated settings).\n  - It highlights a real-world gap: “the rising energy consumption of networks requires more attention to energy-aware pruning,” noting that “preliminary efforts mainly focus on reducing computation and memory costs, which may not necessarily reduce the most energy consumption.” This is a concrete gap with practical significance (energy budgets on edge/mobile devices and data centers).\n  - It emphasizes hardware deployment: “incorporating pruning into hardware to help deploy pruned networks is also an emerging trend,” and even gives a specific pointer (“sui2023hardware propose a hardware-friendly pruning method and deploy the pruned models on an FPGA platform”), showing awareness of co-design needs between algorithms and systems.\n- Application-oriented future directions aligned with current practice:\n  - In “Future Directions – Applications,” the paper points to foundation models: “Foundation models such as GPT-4 might be a possible way to AGI… its enormous size hinders its application in many downstream tasks… more pruning methods will enable colossal foundation models to benefit from pruning research, making them more compact and efficient.” This directly addresses a pressing real-world constraint (deployment and cost of LLMs/multimodal models).\n- Evaluation and benchmarking gaps:\n  - In “Future Directions – Evaluation,” it argues for “standardized benchmarks and metrics… different pruning techniques, network architectures, tasks, and experimental settings lead to incomparable results,” mentions ShrinkBench as a starting point, and calls for broader benchmarks beyond image classification. This recognizes a community-level gap that affects fair comparison and practical adoption.\n\nWhy not 5:\n- While the directions are relevant and forward-looking, the analysis is brief and largely problem-stating rather than solution-defining. For example:\n  - The theoretical questions (“upper bound of prune ratio,” “explainability”) are posed but not accompanied by concrete methodological approaches (e.g., specific theoretical frameworks, experimental protocols, or metrics to operationalize explainability).\n  - Energy-aware pruning is highlighted as necessary, but the paper does not detail actionable modeling choices (e.g., standardized power models, hardware-level measurement protocols, or optimization formulations that trade off accuracy, latency, and energy).\n  - Hardware co-design and foundation model compression are identified as needs, yet the section does not provide a clear, stepwise path or impact assessment (e.g., how to integrate pruning with compiler/runtime scheduling, or how to quantify practical cost savings across deployment contexts).\n  - The benchmarking call is important but remains general (no concrete proposal of a unified task suite or standardized metrics protocol across CV, NLP, speech, and multimodal tasks).\n\nOverall, the paper earns 4 points for proposing forward-looking, relevant directions grounded in field gaps and real-world constraints (theory, energy, hardware, foundation models, evaluation), but falls short of the 5-point standard because it does not present specific, innovative research topics with thorough impact analysis and an actionable roadmap."]}
