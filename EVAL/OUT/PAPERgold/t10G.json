{"name": "G", "paperour": [4, 5, 4, 5, 4, 4, 4], "reason": ["Score: 4/5\n\nExplanation:\n\n- Research objective clarity:\n  - The Introduction clearly states the survey’s scope and goals: “we concentrate solely on reviewing those text retrieval systems,” and “we focus on the techniques and methods for developing and applying LLMs for IR systems.” It further specifies the components to be covered: “covering key perspectives such as query rewriters, retrievers, rerankers, and readers… We also include some recent studies that leverage LLMs as search agents” (Introduction).\n  - The paper defines what it considers an LLM (“models with more than 1B parameters”) and acknowledges exceptions for representativeness, which tightens scope while allowing flexibility (Introduction).\n  - The organizational roadmap at the end of the Introduction (“The remaining part of this survey is organized as follows…”) makes the intended structure and coverage explicit and easy to follow.\n  - The overview figure description (“Overview of existing studies that apply LLMs into IR…”) reinforces the paper’s taxonomy and helps anchor the reader’s expectations.\n\n- Background and motivation:\n  - The Introduction provides a comprehensive historical context for IR, from Boolean and vector space models through BM25 and neural IR, and identifies core challenges (query ambiguity, efficiency, long documents, data scarcity) (Introduction). This background strongly motivates why the LLM era is consequential for IR.\n  - It articulates why LLMs are timely: “Leveraging the impressive power of LLMs can undoubtedly improve the performance of IR systems… essential to comprehensively review their most recent advancements and challenges” and cites both industry (e.g., New Bing) and academic progress (LLM-enhanced retrievers) (Introduction).\n  - The paper positions itself relative to existing surveys: “Compared with them, we focus on the techniques and methods for developing and applying LLMs for IR systems,” and points readers to complementary resources (e.g., strategy report) (Introduction). This shows awareness of the literature and the niche it aims to fill.\n\n- Practical significance and guidance value:\n  - The survey promises actionable value to the community by curating a GitHub repository (“LLM4IR… We will continue to update the repository”), which enhances practical utility (Introduction).\n  - The modular framing (query rewriter, retriever, reranker, reader; plus search agents) and the explicit organization guide readers through a fast-evolving area, which is highly useful for both researchers and practitioners (Introduction and figure overview).\n  - The Motivation ties to current needs (LLMs’ emergent abilities, reasoning, and real systems like New Bing), indicating strong practical relevance.\n\n- Reasons for not awarding a full score:\n  - The Abstract is not included in the provided text, so clarity and succinct articulation of objectives at the abstract level cannot be assessed. For a survey, a strong abstract that crisply states scope, taxonomy, and contributions is important.\n  - While the Introduction is comprehensive, it lacks a concise “contributions” paragraph that enumerates what the survey adds (e.g., taxonomy, comparative analyses, gaps, future directions). The objectives are clear but could be made more explicit with a bullet-point contributions list.\n  - Minor redundancy and editorial issues (e.g., “Apple Siri, Apple Siri,” and some formatting noise) detract from polished clarity.\n  - The survey’s scope notes flexibility (including some models not strictly >1B parameters), which is reasonable, but could be better bounded to avoid ambiguity.\n\nOverall, the Introduction provides clear objectives, strong motivation, and evident practical guidance. The missing abstract and lack of an explicit contributions summary reduce the score from 5 to 4.", "Score: 5\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey presents a clear and coherent method classification that closely mirrors the classical IR pipeline while systematically incorporating LLM-era advances, and it also articulates the evolution of methodologies across components and into agent-based systems.\n\n- Method Classification Clarity:\n  - The paper explicitly organizes the landscape into five major modules—Query Rewriter, Retriever, Reranker, Reader, and Search Agent—introduced visually in the Introduction via the overview figure (“LLMs can be used to enhance traditional IR components… LLMs can also be used as search agents”), and formally in the Background (“In this survey, we focus on the following four modules… Query Rewriter… Retriever… Reranker… Reader… [and] Search Agent”). This top-level taxonomy is both clear and faithful to the IR stack.\n  - Within each module, the authors further define precise subcategories with clean boundaries:\n    - Query Rewriter: The section is structured by “Rewriting Scenarios” (ad-hoc vs conversational and practical domains), “Formats of Rewritten Queries” (questions, keywords, answer-incorporated passages), and “Approaches” (prompting: zero-shot/few-shot/CoT; supervised fine-tuning; reinforcement learning), concluding with “Limitations” (concept drift; performance–expansion correlation). This layered classification cleanly separates use cases, outputs, methods, and caveats.\n    - Retriever: Two top-level lines of work—“Leveraging LLMs to Generate Search Data” (with three concrete frameworks: pseudo query generation, relevance label generation, and complete example generation, supported by Figure and table comparison) and “Leveraging LLMs as Retrievers’ Backbone” (dense retrievers and generative retrievers, e.g., DSI and LLM-URL)—offer a crisp dichotomy of data-centric vs model-centric advances.\n    - Reranker: Four paradigms are articulated—“Utilizing LLMs as Supervised Rerankers” (encoder-only, encoder–decoder, decoder-only); “Utilizing LLMs as Unsupervised Rerankers” (pointwise, listwise, pairwise, illustrated in Figure and benchmark table); “Utilizing LLMs for Training Data Augmentation”; and “Reasoning-intensive Rerankers.” Each is defined with representative methods and properties.\n    - Reader: Clear categorization into “Passive Reader” and “Active Reader,” with passive further subdivided by retrieval timing (“Once-Retrieval,” “Periodic-Retrieval,” “Aperiodic-Retrieval”), followed by “Compressor,” “Analysis,” “Applications,” and “Limitations.” This captures both architectural choices and operational strategies.\n    - Search Agent: A well-structured breakdown into “Architecture” (single-agent vs multi-agent), “Information Seeking Module” (API-based vs browsing-based), “Optimization” (strategic retrieval optimization, iterative retrieval tuning, autonomous open-web search), and “Benchmarks and Resources” (QA vs task-oriented, plus datasets/platforms).\n  - The consistent use of named subsections and supporting figures/tables (e.g., figures for augmentation frameworks; tables comparing augmentation and reranking methods) reinforces categorization clarity.\n\n- Evolution of Methodology:\n  - The Background section provides a historical trajectory from Boolean and vector space models to statistical language models, BM25, neural IR, and then LLMs (including scaling laws, emergent abilities, ICL and parameter-efficient fine-tuning), establishing the broader technological arc that the subsequent sections build upon.\n  - Each module traces a clear evolution path:\n    - Query Rewriter moves from traditional expansion (lexical knowledge bases and PRF) to LLM-driven formats and prompting strategies, and then to SFT and RL aligned to downstream signals—showing a progression from heuristic/lexical methods to generative, instruction-driven, and feedback-optimized rewriting.\n    - Retriever transitions from classical sparse/dense retrieval to LLM-enabled data generation (with specific frameworks and filtering strategies) and to LLM-based embedders (instruction following, in-context learning, length generalization). It further extends to generative retrievers (fine-tuned and prompted DocID/URL generation) and discusses scaling studies and limitations, revealing trends in unifying indexing/retrieval within model parameters and in improving generalization.\n    - Reranker evolves from supervised encoder-only models (e.g., monoBERT) to encoder–decoder generation-based rerankers (monoT5, DuoT5, RankT5), to decoder-only LLM rerankers, and then to unsupervised prompting regimes (pointwise/listwise/pairwise), with explicit discussion of positional bias, efficiency, and aggregation algorithms. The recent “Reasoning-intensive Rerankers” subsection highlights the latest trend of injecting LRM-style reasoning (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-inspired training, SFT+RL pipelines, reasoning data synthesis) into ranking.\n    - Reader evolves from once-off retrieval-enhanced generation (REALM/RAG) to periodic retrieval (RETRO/RALM), then to aperiodic, confidence-triggered retrieval (FLARE, self-RAG), and ultimately to active readers that plan queries (Self-Ask, DSP, PlanRAG) and explore multiple reasoning chains (MRC). The Compressor subsection reflects maturation in handling long contexts (extractive vs abstractive vs dense compression), and the Analysis subsection synthesizes emergent properties (lost-in-the-middle, knowledge conflicts, trade-offs, and attacks).\n    - Search Agent explicitly narrates the shift “from static pipeline-based architectures” to “autonomous search agents,” then systematically introduces single-agent RL/ReAct-style systems (Search-R1, ReSearch, R1-Searcher, START, Atom-Searcher) and multi-agent planners/executors (KwaiAgents, MindSearch, Alita, OWL). Optimization paradigms show a progression: strategic retrieval decision-making (Open-RAG, DeepRAG, ATLAS-Agent), multi-step iterative retrieval (CoRAG, Auto-RAG, RL-based ReSearch/R1-Searcher/Search-R1), and autonomous open-web browsing under sparse rewards (WebAgent-R1, DeepResearcher, WebThinker), culminating in data-centric training ecosystems (WebDancer/WebShaper/WebSailor) and multimodal browsing (WebWatcher).\n  - The Future Direction section consolidates evolutionary themes into forward-looking trajectories per module (e.g., efficiency/distillation, personalized search, multi-modal support, generation-oriented ranking evaluation), reinforcing a systematic view of trends and open challenges.\n\nMinor observations:\n- While evolution is well-described within modules, explicit chronological timelines or cross-module synthesis diagrams could further highlight interdependencies (e.g., how advances in readers and agents feed back into retrievers/rerankers). Nevertheless, the narrative and structure already reveal the major technological trends and methodological progressions.\n\nOverall, the survey’s classification is rigorous and its treatment of methodological evolution is systematic and comprehensive, meriting a top score.", "4\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey provides broad and generally reasonable coverage of datasets and evaluation metrics across multiple IR components (query rewriter, retriever, reranker, reader, and search agents), but it lacks consistently detailed descriptions of dataset scales and labeling protocols beyond a few key cases, and does not fully operationalize generation-focused evaluation metrics.\n\nEvidence and analysis by section:\n\n- Retriever section:\n  - Diversity and detail on datasets: The survey explicitly describes MS MARCO’s scale and labels: “MS MARCO provides a vast repository, containing a million passages, more than 200,000 documents, and 100,000 queries with human-annotated relevance labels” (Training Data Augmentation). This is a strong example of dataset detail and labeling.\n  - It also references BEIR for out-of-domain evaluation (“As a result, there is an emerging need for zero-shot and few-shot learning models… BEIR”), showing awareness of generalization benchmarks.\n  - Metrics usage: While not enumerated here, the section implies standard retrieval metrics and discusses the use of retrieval metrics as rewards in RL for query generation (Query Rewriter > Reinforcement Learning: “using retrieval metrics as rewards”), showing practical metric applicability in optimization.\n\n- Reranker section:\n  - Metrics are clearly applied in comparative experiments: The table explicitly states “we use NDCG@10 as a metric… on TREC-DL2019 and TREC-DL2020.” This demonstrates concrete, standard, and appropriate ranking metrics for reranking comparisons and identifies the evaluation scenario (BM25 top-100 reranking pipeline).\n  - Dataset diversity: Mentions MS MARCO passage ranking as training data (Supervised rerankers) and uses TREC-DL2019/2020 for evaluation in the comparison table, which are core benchmarks in the field.\n  - It also discusses listwise sensitivities (e.g., positional bias in “Listwise Methods”), showing attention to evaluation validity issues beyond raw metrics.\n\n- Reader section (RAG):\n  - Evaluation discussion: In the “Analysis” part, the survey critically examines existing generation metrics: “Traditional evaluation metrics… MRR, MAP, and nDCG” and then highlights limitations of BLEU/ROUGE (“Dependency on lexical matching… Insensitivity to subtle differences… Lack of ability to evaluate factuality”). This shows good awareness of metric rationality and practical meaning, especially for generation tasks.\n  - It further references empirical phenomena like “lost_in_middle,” “rag_tradeoff,” and “if_rag,” which, while not formal metrics, indicate attention to evaluation dimensions (attribution, fluency, placement effects, and retrieval necessity).\n  - However, the reader section stops short of proposing concrete, formal generation metrics for factuality or attribution and does not provide standardized protocols (e.g., human evaluation criteria, faithfulness scoring rubrics), which limits completeness.\n\n- Search Agent section:\n  - Dataset and benchmark diversity is strong. It lists a wide range of QA and task-oriented benchmarks:\n    - QA: TriviaQA, SimpleQA, PopQA, NQ (single-hop); HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA (multi-hop); HLE (expert-level).\n    - Task-oriented: GAIA, AssistantBench, Magnetic-One (assistant workflows); SWE-bench, HumanEvalFix, MLE-bench, MLAgentBench (code/research); RE-Bench, RESEARCHTOWN (multi-agent coordination); WebArena, SpaBench (GUI/web interaction).\n  - It also cites agent datasets/platforms like WebWalkerQA, and training resources such as WebDancer/WebShaper/WebSailor, demonstrating excellent breadth of benchmarks and resources for agents.\n  - Despite the breadth, the survey does not consistently provide dataset scales, labeling schemes, or evaluation metrics per benchmark in this section (e.g., exact sizes, annotation protocols, metric definitions like success rate, F1, EM, or navigation success), which would be needed for a top-score.\n\n- Future Direction and Evaluation sections:\n  - The “Evaluation” subsection explicitly lists classical ranking metrics (precision, recall, MRR, MAP, nDCG) and discusses the need for “Generation-oriented ranking evaluation,” arguing that relevance alone may not capture a document’s role in generation. It also critically evaluates BLEU/ROUGE limitations and the need for factuality-aware metrics. This is strong in rationality but still conceptual; it does not define or adopt specific newer metrics (e.g., factual consistency measures, attribution scoring frameworks) or standardized evaluation protocols.\n\nWhy not 5:\n- While the survey covers many important datasets and benchmarks across IR and agents and uses appropriate ranking metrics in its comparative experiments, it does not systematically provide detailed descriptions for most datasets (scale, labeling method, application scenarios) beyond MS MARCO and some corpus-scale notes for generative retrieval (e.g., “scaling up corpus size from 100k to 8.8M”).\n- Generation metrics are discussed thoughtfully but largely at a conceptual level; concrete, targeted metrics and protocols for factuality, attribution, and faithfulness are not specified or applied.\n- Agent benchmarks are listed comprehensively, but evaluation metrics and criteria for those benchmarks (e.g., exact success definitions, EM/F1, navigation success rates) are not elaborated.\n\nOverall, the survey earns 4 points for broad and largely reasonable coverage of datasets and metrics, meaningful critique of metric applicability, and proper use of ranking metrics in experiments, with room to improve in detailed dataset descriptions and formal, actionable generation evaluation metrics.", "Score: 5\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey offers a systematic, well-structured, and technically grounded comparison across the major components of LLM-enhanced IR, clearly delineating commonalities, distinctions, advantages, and disadvantages along multiple dimensions (architectural choices, learning strategies, data needs, assumptions, and application scenarios). The following evidence supports this assessment:\n\n- Query Rewriter:\n  - Organized comparison along scenarios and formats: “In the realm of IR, a query rewriter is primarily designed to serve two distinct scenarios: ad-hoc retrieval and conversational search.” and “Typically, the formats include questions, keywords, and answer-incorporated passages.” These sections clearly distinguish use-cases and data representations, not just listing works.\n  - Methodological taxonomy with explicit learning strategies: “The utilization of LLMs in query rewriting can be categorized into three primary methodologies: prompting, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning.” The sub-sections on Zero-shot/Few-shot/CoT provide concrete differences in assumptions and usage (e.g., demonstrations vs. none), and the RL subsection explains objective alignment with downstream metrics.\n  - Pros/cons and tradeoffs: The “Limitations” section identifies “Concept Drifts” and the “Correlation between Retrieval Performance and Expansion Effects,” with explicit insight into when expansions help or harm strong/weak models (“revealing a significant negative correlation…”). This goes beyond listing to reasoned comparison of impact.\n\n- Retriever:\n  - Clear two-axis structure: “Roughly, these studies can be categorized into two groups: (1) leveraging LLMs to generate search data, and (2) employing LLMs to enhance model architecture.” This frames differences in objectives and roles.\n  - Systematic comparison table and frameworks: The data augmentation section presents “Three typical frameworks… (pseudo query generation, relevance label generation, and complete example generation)” with Figure and Table (“The comparison of existing data augmentation methods…”) explicitly contrasting number of examples, generator, synthetic data type, filter method, and LLM tuning. This is a multi-dimensional, rigorous comparison.\n  - Architecture-level distinctions: “Leveraging LLMs as Retrievers’ Backbone” separates dense retrievers (fine-tuning embedders, instruction following, length generalizability) from generative retrievers (DSI, semantic DocIDs, constraint decoding) and prompting-based URL generation (“LLM-URL”). It explains assumptions (index-free vs index-based), storage tradeoffs, and scaling effects (“the scaling law… is also applied to generative retrievers”).\n  - Explicit limitations: “Though some efforts have been made… there are still many areas…” (latency, mismatch between LLM-generated text and real queries, domain-specific fine-tuning). These are comparative disadvantages tied to design choices.\n\n- Reranker:\n  - Multi-paradigm comparison: “Existing LLM-based reranking methods can be divided into four paradigms” (supervised, unsupervised pointwise/listwise/pairwise, data augmentation, reasoning-intensive), a highly structured landscape.\n  - Backbone-based distinctions in supervised reranking (encoder-only vs encoder-decoder vs decoder-only), explaining their different training objectives and architectures (e.g., monoT5’s generation of “true/false” vs RankT5’s direct numerical scoring and use of RankNet loss).\n  - Unsupervised methods contrasted with equations and operational properties: Pointwise methods with exact scoring formulas (“f(q, d) = …”), listwise with sliding window and positional bias (“highly sensitive to the document order… positional bias issues”), pairwise with complexity analysis and sorting algorithms (AllPairs O(N^2), heapsort O(N log N)). This is a deep, technical comparison including computational complexity, batching/logit-access constraints, and efficiency tradeoffs.\n  - Quantitative comparison table: “We compare different unsupervised methods… summarized in Table~tab:reranker_comparison” reporting complexity, logits, batching, and NDCG@10 on TREC-DL19/20. This is a robust, dimensioned comparison.\n  - Pros/cons and mitigation: The survey explicitly discusses weaknesses and proposed remedies (e.g., positional bias and “permutation self-consistency”, tournament mechanisms in TourRank, parallelizable partitioning, FIRST logits usage), demonstrating nuanced contrast rather than superficial listing.\n  - Emerging reasoning-intensive rerankers: Distinguishes training paradigms (SFT+RL, distillation from LRMs), domains (reasoning-intensive benchmarks vs MSMARCO), and data scarcity solutions (ReasonRank synthesis). This maps differences in assumptions and data dependency.\n\n- Reader:\n  - Multi-dimensional comparison table for passive reader methods: “The comparison of existing representative methods that have a passive reader module… Where to incorporate retrieval / When to retrieve / How to use LLMs,” explicitly capturing architectural differences (input vs attention layer), timing (beginning vs periodic vs aperiodic), and tuning strategies (prompting vs fine-tuning vs training-from-scratch).\n  - Structured taxonomy: Passive reader (once-, periodic-, aperiodic-retrieval) vs Active reader, each with pros/cons and specific issues (e.g., once-retrieval’s insufficiency, periodic retrieval’s token-based segment noise, and aperiodic confidence-driven retrieval in FLARE).\n  - Compressor comparison: Extractive vs abstractive vs dense-vector compression approaches, discussing learning signals (RL, hindsight/prior vs posterior alignment, summarization distillation) and their tradeoffs, which reflects rigorous method contrast.\n  - Analysis syntheses: Lists empirically grounded findings (lost-in-the-middle, attribution–fluency tradeoff, whether/when to retrieve, knowledge conflict, attack vectors), tying method choices to outcome-level tradeoffs.\n\n- Search Agent:\n  - Architectural comparison: Single-agent vs multi-agent frameworks, with clear advantages and disadvantages (“simplicity… end-to-end via RL” vs struggles with highly complex queries; multi-agent specialization vs joint optimization challenges).\n  - Information-seeking module comparison: API-based vs browsing-based, detailing strengths and limitations (API simplicity vs JS/interactive/content-gated limitations; browsing realism vs latency/resource costs).\n  - Optimization paradigms: Strategic retrieval optimization (explicit retrieval decisions and constructive learning), iterative retrieval tuning (SFT trajectories vs RL interaction and ARPO’s adaptive exploration), and autonomous open-web search (sparse rewards, end-to-end RL, data synthesis frameworks). Each category explains different objectives, assumptions, and training strategies.\n  - Benchmarks/resources: Separates QA-style (single-hop, multi-hop, expert-level) from task-oriented (assistant workflows, code/research, multi-agent coordination, GUI control), plus platforms/datasets with distinct emphases (navigation, trajectory release, formalization-driven synthesis). This supports structured comparative evaluation.\n\nOverall, the survey repeatedly contrasts methods across multiple meaningful dimensions—model architecture, learning objectives, training signals, computational properties, data generation strategies, timing/integration points, and domain assumptions—and consistently articulates pros/cons and mitigation strategies. The inclusion of comparative tables, formulas, complexity analyses, and explicit limitation sections demonstrates rigor and depth, satisfying the criteria for a 5-point score.", "Score: 4/5\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey goes beyond a descriptive catalog and provides meaningful analytical interpretation of methods across modules (query rewriter, retriever, reranker, reader, search agent). It discusses design trade-offs, limitations, and some underlying causes, and it synthesizes relationships across research lines. However, the depth of analysis is uneven across sections: some parts offer strong, technically grounded insights (especially in reranking, reader analysis, and search agents), while others remain more enumerative with limited causal explanation (e.g., some parts of query rewriting and generative retrieval). Below are specific sections and sentences that support this assessment.\n\n- Query Rewriter (Sections “Approaches” and “Limitations”):\n  - The paper identifies why RL aligns query rewriting with downstream goals: “The query rewriter can receive feedback signals from downstream components, such as ranking models or LLM readers… These RL mechanisms align the objective of query rewriters more closely with the goals of downstream tasks.” This shows insight into objective alignment and training signal design.\n  - It highlights a fundamental finding with practical guidance: “A recent comprehensive study… reveals a significant negative correlation between retrieval performance and expansion benefits. Specifically, expansion tends to improve the scores of weaker models but adversely affects stronger ones.” The follow-on recommendation—“only using expansions with weaker models…”—demonstrates interpretive commentary on trade-offs.\n  - Limitation analysis (“Concept Drifts”) attributes drift to the model’s broad knowledge: “introduction of unrelated information… due to the LLM’s vast knowledge base,” which explains a mechanistic cause. However, the sections “Formats of Rewritten Queries” and much of “Approaches” are predominantly descriptive, and do not fully explain why, for instance, answer-incorporated passages outperform other formats under certain retrieval regimes.\n\n- Retriever (Sections on LLM-based data augmentation and backbone retrievers; Generative Retriever; Limitations):\n  - Provides causal reasoning about latency and practicality: “a critical requirement for retrievers is fast response, while the main problem of existing LLMs is the huge model parameters and overlong inference time.”\n  - Explains why LLM-based embedders unlock new capacities: “ability to follow instructions… adapted through in-context learning… length-generalizable capacity,” connecting architectural scale and training paradigm to capability differences.\n  - Generative retrieval discusses the paradigm’s trade-offs: “knowledge of the document corpus is stored in the model parameters, eliminating the need for additional storage… [but] it is still challenging for generative retrievers to cover large-scale document corpus.” It relates scaling law observations and corpus size, though it stops short of deeply analyzing failure modes (e.g., parameter allocation vs identifier collision or incremental updates).\n  - The “Limitations” section sensibly identifies mismatches between synthetic and real queries and domain adaptation needs, which are grounded concerns, but more causal analysis of why synthetic data fails (distributional characteristics, linguistic style differences) is only implicit.\n\n- Reranker (Supervised, Unsupervised, Data Augmentation, Reasoning-intensive; Comparison and Discussion; Limitations):\n  - Strong analytical commentary on listwise methods: “The performance of listwise methods is highly sensitive to the document order… positional bias issues.” It ties method behavior (sliding windows, positional dependence) to performance outcomes and efficiency constraints (“dependency between adjacent windows prevents parallelization…”).\n  - The comparison section explicitly relates algorithmic properties to outcomes: “pointwise methods… offer lower time complexity and enable batch inference… However… [lack] advantage in performance.” For pairwise: “primary drawback is low efficiency.” This is a clear trade-off analysis.\n  - It connects mitigation strategies to identified weaknesses (e.g., “permutation self-consistency,” “tournament mechanism,” “parallelizable partitioning”)—a sign of synthesis and interpretive insight.\n  - Reasoning-intensive rerankers: the paper interprets why reasoning chains help (“precise understanding of query intent and cross-document comparison”) and discusses training regimes (“SFT+RL”, rule-based rewards), which shows reflective commentary on process-level causes of gains.\n\n- Reader (Passive vs Active; Once/Periodic/Aperiodic Retrieval; Analysis):\n  - The retrieval timing analysis is technically grounded: “retrieving documents in a mandatory frequency may mismatch the retrieval timing and can be costly. FLARE… determining timing… according to the probability of generating texts,” and it justifies the gating signal via “probability as an indicator of LLMs’ confidence.”\n  - “Analysis” section synthesizes empirical phenomena with implications: \n    - “lost_in_middle” explains position sensitivity and motivates ranking,\n    - “rag_tradeoff” articulates a trade-off between attribution and fluency with more references,\n    - “if_rag” argues against unconditional retrieval and proposes a popularity-based gate,\n    - “knowledge-conflict” notes majority-rule behavior in conflicts,\n    - “rag_attack” identifies poisoning vulnerabilities (even typos).\n  - These are insightful, evidence-based commentaries that interpret mechanisms and design implications.\n\n- Search Agent (Architecture; Information Seeking; Optimization; Benchmarks):\n  - Architecture section captures core design trade-offs: single-agent end-to-end RL simplicity vs multi-agent specialization and joint optimization difficulties. “However, a single agent often struggles… multi-agent… introduces challenges in jointly optimizing multiple agents through RL,” which is solid analytical framing.\n  - Information seeking module compares APIs vs browsing: “API-based… struggle with complex, dynamic content rendered by JavaScript… Browsing-based… better suited… incur higher latency and resource costs.” This is a clear cause-and-effect analysis.\n  - Optimization section articulates method-level mechanisms: \n    - “hybrid adaptive retrieval” and constructive learning via distractors explain robustness,\n    - modeling retrieval decisions as MDP with imitation learning (DeepRAG) is a grounded causal account,\n    - “critical steps” backpropagation (ATLAS-Agent) connects training signal design to strategic behavior.\n  - The RL-based iterative retrieval tuning and autonomous open-web search sections synthesize training strategy design with agent behavior and evaluation environment constraints.\n\n- Evaluation and Future Directions:\n  - Evaluation section identifies gaps: “Traditional metrics… may fall short… A formal and rigorous evaluation metric… has yet to be defined,” and discusses weaknesses of BLEU/ROUGE for factuality—this is reflective and technically grounded.\n  - Future directions consistently translate limitations into research agendas (e.g., “Reducing latency” via distillation/quantization; “Incremental indexing for generative retrieval”; “Generation-oriented ranking evaluation”)—useful guidance backed by earlier analyses.\n\nWhere depth is uneven:\n- Some subsections (e.g., “Formats of Rewritten Queries” and parts of “Training Data Augmentation”) mainly enumerate methods and results with limited mechanistic comparison and do not deeply probe underlying causes for differences across prompt types or augmentation filters.\n- Generative retrieval’s scaling challenges are acknowledged but not dissected in terms of identifier semantics, error propagation, or catastrophic interference when updating corpora—causal depth is lighter here.\n- Passive reader variants are thoroughly described, but the causal link between insertion points (input layer vs attention layer) and resulting generation behavior could be further unpacked.\n\nOverall, the paper offers meaningful analytical interpretation with multiple technically grounded insights and explicit trade-off discussions, but the depth varies across topics, hence a 4 instead of 5.\n\nResearch guidance value:\nHigh. The survey articulates concrete, technically informed future directions (e.g., latency reduction strategies, incremental indexing for generative IR, personalized reranking, evaluation metrics tailored to generation-oriented IR, retrieval timing control). It also summarizes empirical analyses (lost-in-the-middle, attribution–fluency trade-off, conditional retrieval, knowledge conflict, poisoning attacks) that directly guide research design and evaluation.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe paper’s Future Direction section systematically identifies research gaps across the key IR components (query rewriter, retriever, reranker, reader), and also extends to evaluation and bias—showing broad coverage of methods, data, and “other dimensions.” However, while many gaps are clearly articulated, the analysis is often brief and lacks deeper discussion of potential impact or concrete pathways to address them. This aligns best with the “4 points” criterion: comprehensive identification of gaps, but with limited depth in the analysis for several items.\n\nSupport from specific parts of the paper:\n\n- Comprehensive coverage across modules:\n  - Query Rewriter (Future Direction → Query Rewriter): The authors identify gaps such as “Rewriting queries according to ranking performance,” “Improving query rewriter in conversational search,” and “Achieving personalized query rewriter.” These directly point to methodological needs (closing the loop with ranking signals; leveraging conversational context) and data/application gaps (personalization and behavior simulation). For example, “Despite LLMs being capable of identifying potential user intents… they lack awareness of the resulting retrieval quality of the rewritten query,” which clearly motivates integrating downstream ranking feedback.\n  - Retriever (Future Direction → Retriever): Multiple substantive gaps are identified, including efficiency/latency (“LLMs… entail high latency… search engines require in-time responses”), data augmentation realism (“existing methods… generate queries without aligning them with real user queries”), generative retrieval maintenance (“static nature of LLM parameters… poses challenges for updating document indexes”), and modality (“Supporting multi-modal search”). Each highlights an important barrier in deployment and generalization.\n  - Reranker (Future Direction → Reranker): The section raises issues about online availability/cost (“many reranking methods rely on calling LLM APIs, incurring considerable costs”), personalization (“by analyzing users’ search history…”), and task diversity (“response ranking, evidence ranking, entity ranking”). These are relevant method and application gaps, though the discussion is concise.\n  - Reader (Future Direction → Reader): Gaps include reference quality (“some passages… may be irrelevant… introduce noise”) and answer reliability (“it remains uncertain whether the LLMs refer to these supported materials”). These are central to RAG robustness and attribution, though the analysis is brief and lacks specific mitigation strategies beyond the identification of the problems.\n  - Search Agent (Future Direction → Search Agent): The paper flags trustworthiness (“ensure the validity of retrieved documents… enabling LLMs to autonomously validate the documents”) and bias/offensive content (“presence of biases… amplified by low-quality information gathered from the web”), which are critical to agent deployment. Again, these are important but discussed at a high level.\n  - Evaluation (Future Direction → Evaluation): This subsection is the most analytically developed. It critiques current ranking and generation metrics and explains why they are insufficient. For ranking: “These metrics may fall short in capturing a document’s role in the generation of passages or answers,” proposing the need for “generation-oriented ranking evaluation.” For generation: it lays out three specific limitations—lexical matching dependence (BLEU/ROUGE), insensitivity to subtle differences, and lack of factuality assessment, explicitly linking them to hallucination risks and the need for knowledge-grounded evaluation. This shows meaningful depth about why the gaps matter and their impact on measuring progress.\n  - Bias (Future Direction → Bias): The section identifies “source bias” toward LLM-generated text (“their topics are more consistent and the perplexity… lower”), with citations and a clear statement of the systemic risk to IR systems. The problem is well-motivated, though mitigation strategies are not elaborated.\n\nWhy this is a 4 and not a 5:\n- Strengths toward a 5: The coverage is broad and well-structured, touching data (realistic query synthesis, personalization data, evaluation datasets), methods (efficiency, incremental indexing, multimodal integration, reasoning-aware reranking, agent tool use), and system-level concerns (evaluation, bias). The Evaluation subsection in particular provides a thoughtful analysis of why existing measures are inadequate and how that affects field progress.\n- Limitations preventing a 5: Many identified gaps are presented as bullet points with limited elaboration on mechanisms, potential impact, or concrete research agendas. For example, multimodal retrieval is noted as promising but only suggests “combine LLMs with existing multi-modal retrieval models” without discussing challenges like alignment, indexing, or cost trade-offs. Similarly, personalization for reranking and query rewriting is highlighted but lacks discussion on privacy, data collection biases, or evaluation frameworks. The Search Agent trustworthiness and bias points are important but remain at a high level without detailed pathways (e.g., formal verification, provenance tracking, robust filtering). There is limited discussion of the broader impact on field development (e.g., reproducibility, benchmark contamination, cost/energy constraints, RL stability for agents) and few concrete methodological proposals beyond general directions.\n\nOverall, the Future Direction section does a strong job identifying key gaps across the IR pipeline and adjacent concerns, with especially good analytical depth in the Evaluation subsection. The analysis elsewhere is meaningful but concise, warranting a score of 4.", "4\n\nExplanation:\nThe “Future Direction” section presents several forward-looking research directions that are clearly grounded in recognized gaps and real-world needs across IR components (query rewriter, retriever, reranker, reader, search agents) and evaluation. The suggestions are specific and often actionable, but the analysis of potential impact and the methodological path is generally brief rather than deeply developed, which aligns with a 4-point score.\n\nEvidence from specific parts of the paper:\n\n- Query Rewriter:\n  - Gap identification and actionable direction: “Rewriting queries according to ranking performance… they lack awareness of the resulting retrieval quality… a substantial realm of research remains unexplored concerning the integration of ranking results.” This ties a clear gap (rewrite quality not aligned with ranking outcomes) to a concrete direction (integrating ranking signals, possibly via RL), serving a real-world need for better end-to-end effectiveness.\n  - Real-world need and direction for conversational search: “Improving query rewriter in conversational search… incorporate historical interactive information… simulate user behavior… providing more training data.” This addresses long-tail and data scarcity issues in practical systems.\n  - Personalization: “Achieving personalized query rewriter… leverage [LLMs] to build user profiles… empowers the achievement of personalized query rewriter.” This aligns with practical personalized search needs.\n\n- Retriever:\n  - Latency and deployment practicality: “Reducing the latency of LLM-based retrievers… transferring the capabilities of LLMs to smaller models, exploring quantization techniques…” This directly addresses real-world constraints in search engines.\n  - Data realism: “Simulating realistic queries for data augmentation… exploring techniques such as reinforcement learning…” The gap (mismatch between synthetic and real queries) and direction are well connected.\n  - Generative retrieval maintenance: “Incremental indexing for generative retrieval… crucial to explore methods for constructing an incremental index…” This targets a practical challenge when corpora evolve.\n  - Multimodal search need: “Supporting multi-modal search… combine the language understanding capability of LLMs with existing multi-modal retrieval models.” This anticipates real-world web content.\n\n- Reranker:\n  - Cost and online applicability: “Enhancing the online availability of LLMs… devising effective approaches (such as distilling to small models).” This is actionable and maps to deployment constraints.\n  - Personalization and task diversity: “Improving personalized search… Adapting to diverse ranking tasks… instruction tuning.” These are concrete directions aligned with broader IR needs.\n\n- Reader (RAG):\n  - Input quality and hallucination control: “Improving the reference quality for LLMs… extract relevant snippets…” and “Improving the answer reliability… investigate the influence of these references…” Both address well-known real-world issues of noisy contexts and faithfulness in generation with clear suggested directions.\n\n- Search Agent:\n  - Trustworthiness and safety: “Enhancing the Trustworthiness of LLMs… enabling LLMs to autonomously validate the documents they scrape.” Clear linkage to practical reliability concerns.\n  - Bias and offensive content: “Mitigating Bias and Offensive Content… multi-faceted approach… improvements in training data, algorithmic adjustments, and continuous monitoring…” This is aligned with deployment ethics and safety, though high-level.\n\n- Evaluation:\n  - Novel metric needs: “Generation-oriented ranking evaluation… a formal and rigorous evaluation metric… has yet to be defined.” Identifies a key gap; the direction is important but lacks detailed path.\n  - Generation evaluation limitations and remedies: The section lists three limitations (lexical matching dependence, insensitivity, factuality) and suggests potentially incorporating “knowledge bases or reference texts,” showing a practical framing but limited methodological depth.\n\n- Bias:\n  - Emerging systemic issue: “source bias towards LLM-generated text… necessary to consider how to build IR systems free from this category of bias.” This is forward-looking and relevant to real-world ecosystems, but it stops short of proposing concrete methodologies.\n\nOverall, the section effectively ties gaps to directions across multiple modules and includes specific, relevant suggestions (e.g., RL for query rewriting, distillation/quantization for latency, incremental indexing for generative retrieval, instruction tuning for diverse ranking tasks, snippet extraction for RAG, autonomous document validation for agents). However, it generally presents these directions succinctly, without extensive analysis of academic/practical impact or detailed implementation paths. This justifies a score of 4 rather than 5."]}
