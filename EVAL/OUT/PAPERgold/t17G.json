{"name": "G", "paperour": [4, 4, 4, 5, 4, 4, 4], "reason": ["Score: 4/5\n\nExplanation:\n\n1) Research Objective Clarity\n- Clear, specific objective: The Introduction explicitly states the paper’s aim multiple times. For example: “this work presents a comprehensive survey of LLM-enabled telecom networks” and “this work provides a comprehensive survey on fundamentals, key techniques, and applications of LLM-enabled telecom.” It further delineates scope through precise terminology definitions: “‘foundation models’ refers to models… beyond pure language-related tasks… while ‘LLM-enabled’ or ‘LLM-aided’ approaches denote methods that repurpose existing pre-trained language models for telecom tasks.” It also clarifies that “when referring to LLMs, it means that the inputs to the model are purely text… When discussing the multi-modal inputs, we explicitly describe them as multi-modal large language models or multi-modal LLMs.”\n- Structured focus areas: The Introduction lists six concrete topical pillars: “LLM fundamentals,” “generation,” “classification,” “optimization,” “prediction,” and “challenges and future directions.” The paper reiterates the intended structure: “The rest of this paper is organized as Fig. fig1” and maps each section (e.g., Sections sec-gene, sec-class, sec-optimize, sec-predict) to these objectives. This provides readers with a precise roadmap of what the survey will cover.\n- Positioning and contributions: The paper differentiates itself from prior surveys in the “Related Surveys” discussion and in the Introduction: it claims broader coverage (“from model architecture, pre-training, fine-tuning, inference and utilization, and evaluation, to deployment”), and uniquely emphasizes LLM-inspired techniques (e.g., reward design for RL, black-box optimization, time-series LLMs) and telecom deployments (cloud, edge, on-device). It states, “This work covers nearly 20 telecom application scenarios… aiming to be a roadmap.”\n\nWhy not 5/5: There is no Abstract provided in the supplied text. For a literature survey, the Abstract is the primary place to state the objective succinctly, delimit scope, and foreground contributions. Its absence reduces upfront clarity. In addition, while the objectives are comprehensive and repeated, they could be distilled into a single, concise statement early on. Finally, boundaries such as inclusion/exclusion criteria, time window of the literature, and explicit research questions are not clearly stated in the Introduction; adding those would further sharpen objective clarity.\n\n2) Background and Motivation\n- Strong, well-argued background: The Introduction thoroughly motivates the problem by linking 6G targets and complexity to management challenges: “6G networks are expected to achieve terabits per second… connection densities… and lower than 0.1 ms latency… such highly integrated network architecture and functions may lead to a huge burden on 6G network management.” It situates prior AI/ML work in telecom (RL for network management, CSI prediction, federated learning) and contrasts with the new opportunities and gaps of LLMs: “LLM technologies have many promising features… Existing studies have shown that LLMs can answer telecom-domain questions, generate troubleshooting reports, develop project code, and configure networks… However… applying a general-domain LLM directly to telecom tasks may lead to poor performance… fine-tuning… requires [careful] dataset collection… many telecom tasks require multi-step planning.”\n- Clear rationale for a comprehensive survey now: The text stresses rapid progress and fragmentation of prior work (“Existing studies… focus on one specific aspect”), justifying a broader, structured survey that integrates fundamentals, techniques, and applications.\n\n3) Practical Significance and Guidance Value\n- Practicality and guidance are emphasized: The objectives translate into actionable guidance—e.g., deployment strategies (“central cloud, network edge, on-device”), concrete techniques (instruction/alignment tuning, CoT, planning, self-refinement), and application categories mapped to telecom use cases (generation: coding, troubleshooting, configuration; classification: security, text/image/traffic; optimization: reward design, verbal RL, convex, heuristic; prediction: time-series foundation models and multi-modality).\n- The paper explicitly positions itself as a “roadmap” and claims detailed, engineering-oriented coverage: “For each application, this work provides technical details such as framework, pre-training steps, and prompt designs,” and “aiming to be a roadmap for researchers to use LLMs to solve various telecom tasks.” This indicates strong guidance value for both researchers and practitioners.\n\nAreas to improve for a 5/5:\n- Provide an Abstract that crisply states objective, scope, novelty, and key contributions.\n- Add explicit research questions and survey methodology (literature search scope, inclusion/exclusion criteria, time horizon), which would tighten the objective and make the guidance even more actionable.\n- Clean minor formatting/citation issues in the Introduction that occasionally distract from clarity.\n\nOverall, despite the missing Abstract, the Introduction articulates a clear, specific objective, provides strong motivation, and sets out a practical roadmap—hence 4/5.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\n- Method Classification Clarity: The paper presents a clear and well-structured taxonomy that is easy to follow. After the Introduction, it lays out “LLM Fundamentals” (Sections on Model Architecture, Pre-training, Fine-tuning, Inference via Prompting, Evaluation, and Deployment), followed by four application-driven pillars: Generation, Classification, Optimization, and Prediction. This categorization is explicitly motivated and justified (e.g., the footnote in the Introduction notes that although classification/optimization/prediction ultimately rely on LLM’s generation, separating them “can significantly reduce the reader’s difficulty in understanding the LLM’s potential for telecom applications”). Each fundamental subcategory is further defined:\n  - Model architecture: encoder-only, encoder–decoder, and decoder-only (LLM Fundamentals → Model Architecture).\n  - Pre-training: dataset collection, preprocessing, and scalable training techniques like 3D parallelism and ZeRO (LLM Fundamentals → Pre-training).\n  - Fine-tuning: instruction tuning and alignment tuning (including RLHF and DPO, and alternatives such as Constitutional AI and RLAIF) (LLM Fundamentals → Fine-tuning).\n  - Prompting: ICL → CoT → Planning → Self-refinement (LLM Fundamentals → Inference and Utilization by Prompting, and Fig. fig-prompting).\n  - Deployment: cloud, edge, on-device, cache-based, and cooperative (LLM Fundamentals → Deployment in Telecom Networks and Table tab-deploy).\n  This hierarchy is consistently applied in later sections where each application area is broken down into concrete subtopics (e.g., Generation: domain knowledge, code, network configuration; Classification: security, text, image, encrypted traffic; Optimization: RL reward design and verbal RL, black-box, convex, heuristic; Prediction: pre-trained foundation models, frozen LLMs via hard/soft prompting and preprocessing, fine-tuned LLMs with LoRA/LNT, multi-modality). The summaries and tables (e.g., Table tab-llm-generation, Table tab-class-summary, Table tab-summary-opt, and Table tab-mlsummary) reinforce the clarity by listing features, requirements, advantages, and telecom opportunities.\n\n- Evolution of Methodology: The paper generally shows method evolution and trends, particularly within the LLM fundamentals and prediction sections:\n  - It traces the transformer backbone and architectural variants (encoder-only → encoder–decoder → decoder-only) and explains why causal attention is more natural for time-series forecasting (LLM Fundamentals → Model Architecture).\n  - It presents a progression in fine-tuning from supervised instruction tuning to alignment tuning, discussing shifts from RLHF to DPO and the emergence of Constitutional AI/RLAIF to reduce dependence on costly human preference data (LLM Fundamentals → Fine-tuning).\n  - In prompting, there is a clear evolution from ICL to CoT prompting, then to planning for complex tasks, and finally to self-refinement (LLM Fundamentals → Inference and Utilization by Prompting; Fig. fig-prompting).\n  - Deployment trends are discussed from cloud-centric to edge and on-device, with hybrid cache-based and cooperative schemes that reflect practical constraints and telecom latency demands (LLM Fundamentals → Deployment).\n  - In optimization, the survey highlights a shift from manual RL reward design to LLM-automated reward design (Song et al., Kwon et al., Eureka), the emergence of verbal reinforcement learning where LLM acts as an agent, and exploration of LLM-enabled convex optimization assistance and heuristic algorithm generation (LLM-enabled Optimization Techniques; Table tab-llm-optimization and related subsections). This shows evolution from traditional RL/convex/heuristic pipelines toward LLM-assisted and LLM-driven methods.\n  - The prediction section is especially systematic in presenting an evolutionary pipeline: (1) pre-training foundation models for zero-shot forecasting (e.g., TimeGPT, TimesFM; encoder–decoder vs decoder-only), (2) frozen pre-trained LLMs via hard prompts, soft prompts, and preprocessing (LLMTIME), (3) parameter-efficient fine-tuning for time series (LoRA, LNT; LLM4TS, FITS), and (4) multi-modal LLMs aligned with 6G sensing trends (Prediction → Pre-training Foundation Models; Frozen Pre-trained LLM; Fine-tuned LLM Prediction; Multi-modal LLM for Telecom Prediction; Figs. fig-prediction, fig-prediction-decoder, fig-llm4ts, fig-multi-moda). This sequence reveals the methodological trajectory from general models to telecom-specialized approaches and to richer multi-modal integration.\n\n- Reasons for not scoring 5: While the classification is very clear and the evolution is largely presented, the paper does not consistently provide a chronological or stage-wise evolution narrative within each application area (e.g., Generation and Classification sections focus on topical breadth and capability rather than explicitly tracing historical development paths in telecom). The “Related Surveys” section (Table tab1 and the discussion) strongly contrasts coverage breadth across existing surveys but less explicitly maps a timeline or stages of methodological progression in telecom. Also, connections between some categories (e.g., how specific telecom subdomains transitioned across model generations in practice) are implied rather than systematically detailed.\n\nOverall, the survey excels at structuring the field and surfacing current methodological trends, especially in fundamentals, optimization, and prediction. Minor gaps in explicit evolutionary staging across all application sections prevent a top score, hence a 4.", "Score: 4\n\nDetailed explanation:\n\n- Diversity of datasets and metrics:\n  - The survey covers a broad set of datasets relevant to telecom-focused LLM work and explicitly consolidates them in the table “Summary of Telecom datasets for LLM” (near the end of the paper). That table lists multiple datasets spanning tasks such as summarization (5GSum, Tspec-LLM), question answering (TeleQnA, NetEval, TeleQuAD, StandardsQA, ORAN-Bench-13K), and sentence classification (5GSC), and provides document counts, question counts, and open-source availability. This directly supports diversity and breadth in dataset coverage.\n  - Beyond the summary table, the text references further domain datasets:\n    - Domain knowledge generation: MS MARCO document ranking dataset (bajaj2016ms) is discussed in the troubleshooting generation pipeline in Fig. fig-gene-answer and accompanying description, highlighting a general QA corpus used for ranking and retrieval in telecom troubleshooting settings.\n    - Security/attack detection: The EdgeIIoTset dataset (9751703) is used to build SecurityBERT (ferrag2024revolutionizing), with detailed class taxonomy (DoS/DDoS, MITM, injection, malware) and a description of how raw features are converted to text for LLM training.\n    - Encrypted traffic classification: Multiple datasets and tasks are cited and used, e.g., ISCX VPN (sirinam2018deep), FlowPrint (van2020flowprint), and a VPN characterization dataset (draper2016characterization) to demonstrate BERT-BiLSTM and ET-BERT.\n    - Configuration generation: CloudEval-YAML is presented as a benchmark for YAML configurations; NETBUDDY’s evaluation on an emulator is described; VPP leverages Batfish for verification feedback.\n  - Evaluation metrics are covered systematically in the dedicated subsection “Evaluation metrics of LLM.” That section discusses:\n    - Accuracy and benchmark-based evaluation.\n    - Hallucination and factual consistency, with explicit mention of ROUGE (lin2004rouge), BERTScore (zhang2019bertscore), and newer hallucination metrics (AlignScore in zha2023alignscore).\n    - Efficiency (energy usage, latency, hardware costs), citing sustainability and carbon cost work (samsi2023words, faiz2023llmcarbon) and data efficiency (mcdonald2022great).\n    - Human alignment and manual evaluation, grounded in human preference/ethics literature (chang2023survey; zieims2024can; liang2022holistic).\n  - The application sections further report standard task metrics:\n    - Security/attack detection: Accuracy, recall, and F1-score for SecurityBERT (“average accuracy, recall, and F1-score of 0.98, 0.84, and 0.84”).\n    - Encrypted traffic classification: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 (“BERT-BiLSTM … achieving an overall accuracy of 99.70%, precision of 99.34%, recall of 99.51%, and F1-score of 99.43%”).\n    - Code generation: Repair rate percentages and impact on coding time (“repaired 86.71% … few-shot examples raise to 96.50%”; “reduced coding time by 65.16% and 68.44%”).\n    - Optimization: Success rates and normalized improvement (“outperforms human experts on 83% of the tasks … average normalized improvement of 52%”; success rate ~0.8 in LP/MILP).\n  - Collectively, these support that the survey spans multiple datasets and metrics types across QA, classification, configuration, security, traffic classification, and optimization.\n\n- Rationality of datasets and metrics:\n  - The paper explicitly motivates why certain metrics matter in telecom contexts. In “Evaluation metrics of LLM,” it ties efficiency and latency to telecom operational constraints and sustainability; it also highlights hallucination risks and the importance of factual consistency for domain reliability.\n  - In “LLM Deployment in Telecom Networks,” the discussion of latency constraints and inference time (0.58 to 90 seconds) reinforces why efficiency metrics are practically meaningful for telecom applications (URLLC, edge/cloud trade-offs).\n  - For classification tasks, the choice of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 is academically standard and practically relevant (e.g., attack detection, encrypted traffic classification). The survey provides dataset-task pairing and sensible metrics for each (e.g., ISCX VPN and ET-BERT evaluated on multiple downstream tasks).\n  - For security datasets, EdgeIIoTset is appropriate for telecom/IoT attack detection and the paper explains tokenization and textual transformation to fit LLM workflows—showing methodological rationality.\n  - For configuration generation, the use of verifiers (Batfish) and emulator-based evaluation in NETBUDDY shows practically grounded evaluation strategies (syntax, semantics, policy correctness), which is highly relevant to operators.\n\n- Areas for improvement (reasons the score is not 5):\n  - While the dataset table is valuable, descriptions are relatively shallow; most entries lack details on labeling methodology, splits, modality coverage, or licensing constraints. For example, 5GSum/Tspec-LLM are listed with document counts but without clear annotation schemes or segment granularity; QA datasets list question counts but not answer types, provenance, or train/test splits.\n  - The survey gives limited coverage of multimodal telecom datasets (images/videos/LiDAR) that would be relevant to the multi-modal LLM prediction and classification sections (e.g., vision-aided beamforming and blockage detection). The multi-modal prediction section motivates the need but does not enumerate or detail corresponding public datasets in telecom.\n  - In time-series prediction, the survey does not standardize or exemplify common forecasting metrics like RMSE, MAE, sMAPE, MASE, or CRPS in its evaluation discussion; references to prediction model performance are more conceptual than metric-driven. Similarly, code generation metrics beyond repair rate and task success (e.g., HumanEval/MBPP pass@k, compilation rate, runtime correctness) are referenced tangentially but not organized into a metric framework for telecom tasks.\n  - Some benchmarks are mentioned (CloudEval-YAML, HumanEval, GSM8K, Big-Bench Hard), but their metric definitions or how they translate to telecom relevance are not fully elaborated.\n\nOverall, the paper includes multiple datasets and a meaningful set of evaluation metrics with telecom-specific rationale (particularly for accuracy, hallucination, efficiency, and human alignment). It also reports standard classification metrics in its application sections. The main limitations are the depth of dataset descriptions (labeling/splits/modality), limited cataloguing of multimodal telecom datasets, and the absence of a consolidated metric framework for prediction tasks and code/configuration generation. Hence, a score of 4 is appropriate.", "Score: 5\n\nExplanation:\nThe paper provides a systematic, well-structured, and technically grounded comparison of methods across multiple meaningful dimensions, meeting the criteria for a top score.\n\n- Comparison of LLM architectures (Section “Model Architecture”): The paper clearly contrasts encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only designs, explaining differences in attention mechanisms (bidirectional vs. causal), typical task fit (understanding vs. generation), and representative models (e.g., BERT, T5/BART, GPT/PaLM/LLaMA). Examples include: “Models with an encoder-only structure… are tailored for language understanding tasks…” and “Decoder-only architectures specialize in unidirectional attention… Causal decoders are predominantly adopted in popular LLMs…” This section goes beyond listing by explaining technical assumptions and implications for telecom use.\n\n- Prompting techniques (Section “LLM Inference and Utilization by Prompting”): The paper distinguishes ICL, CoT, planning, and self-refinement, explaining mechanisms, strengths, and limitations. It notes, for instance, “ICL… utilizes formatted natural language prompts… The design of demonstrations is critical…” and “CoT… faces challenges such as incorrect reasoning and instability… enhancement strategies include… verification-based methods.” The planning component is decomposed into “task planner,” “plan executor,” and “environment,” and self-refinement is described with actionable feedback loops. These are comparative along learning strategy and robustness dimensions.\n\n- Deployment strategies (Section “LLM Deployment in Telecom Networks” and Table “Summary of LLM deployment strategies”): The paper systematically compares cloud, edge, on-device, cache-based, and cooperative deployments, detailing features and trade-offs (latency, bandwidth, resource constraints, coordination complexity). Examples include: “Cloud deployment… provides abundant computational resources… [but] higher end-to-end latency… and extra bandwidth costs,” versus “Network edge deployment… shorten the response time… [but] limited computational and storage capacities… techniques… parameter-efficient fine-tuning, split edge learning, quantized training.” The cooperative model (“EdgeFM”) is contrasted with specific performance gains (“3.2x lower latency, 34.3% accuracy improvement”), providing rigorous, application-grounded comparison.\n\n- Related surveys (Section “Related Surveys” and the comparison table): The paper contrasts prior surveys across coverage dimensions (fundamentals, deployment, multi-modality, applications), explicitly identifying gaps (e.g., “chain-of-thought and step-by-step planning are not discussed in many existing studies”), and distinguishing its contributions (broader topic coverage and application depth). This is a structured comparison of prior work’s scope and assumptions.\n\n- Optimization techniques (Section “LLM-enabled Optimization Techniques” and Table “Summary of LLM-aided Optimization Techniques Studies”): The paper compares multiple families—LLM-aided RL (automatic reward design vs. verbal RL), black-box optimizers, convex optimization, and heuristic design—along objectives, inputs/prompts, advantages, and limitations. It states, for instance, “Automatic reward function design can significantly save human effort… [but] is still at a very early stage,” “Verbal reinforcement learning… avoids the difficulty of tuning hyperparameters… allows for language instructions… provides interpretable explanations,” and “Black-box optimization avoids the complexity of building dedicated optimization models… [but] performance cannot be guaranteed.” The convex optimization subsection details differences in problem transformation and solver integration (“diagnose infeasibility… generate code… call the solver… rerun tests”), while heuristic design is broken into staged prompt-driven synthesis and reasoning. The summary table further contrasts these methods across advantages, issues, and telecom applicability—demonstrating depth and clarity.\n\n- Prediction methods (Section “Time Series LLM for Prediction Problems” and Table “Summary of LLM-based Prediction for Telecom”): The paper compares pre-trained foundation models vs. frozen LLMs (hard/soft prompting vs. preprocessing), fine-tuned LLMs (LoRA/LNT), and multi-modal prediction. It explains architectural choices (encoder-decoder vs. decoder-only, with causal attention’s suitability for time series) and tokenization (“patching to reduce input tokens”). It presents concrete telecom-oriented hard prompt templates (e.g., traffic, users, customer service), and discusses preprocessing trade-offs (“introducing extra space” and “eliminating decimal points”). The fine-tuning discussion is technically precise (LoRA update W’ = W + AB, and where to apply), and the multi-modal section ties sensing and prediction in 6G contexts (CSI, mmWave/THz beamforming, traffic load, QoE), contrasting single-modality methods with multi-modal LLM advantages.\n\nOverall, the paper consistently:\n- Compares methods across architecture, learning strategy, deployment, data/tokenization, and application scenarios.\n- Clearly articulates advantages and disadvantages and identifies commonalities and distinctions.\n- Grounds differences in technical assumptions and objectives (e.g., attention type, inference latency, resource constraints, training strategy).\n- Avoids superficial listing by providing structured tables and detailed narratives (e.g., pros/cons, input requirements, potential issues, telecom-specific opportunities).\n\nMinor areas where comparisons occasionally remain at a higher level (e.g., some generation/classification tables largely list studies and findings) do not detract from the overall rigor and breadth of comparative analysis across the core methodological sections.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey provides meaningful, technically grounded analysis across methods and deployment choices, and often goes beyond description to discuss underlying mechanisms, trade-offs, and limitations. However, the depth is uneven—some parts are richly analytical while others remain largely descriptive or aspirational. Below are specific instances that support this score.\n\n- Related Surveys (Section “Related Surveys”):\n  - The paper clearly identifies gaps in prior surveys and explains why those gaps matter. For example, it notes that “prompt engineering is of great importance… but some crucial techniques such as chain-of-thought (CoT) and step-by-step planning are not discussed in many existing studies,” and highlights novel directions (e.g., reward design and time-series LLMs) “not mentioned in most existing studies.” This is interpretive commentary that positions the work meaningfully within the literature rather than merely listing prior work.\n  - It synthesizes across research lines, e.g., noting multi-modality is discussed in some studies but “not from the prediction perspective,” thereby clarifying where the current survey extends the discourse.\n\n- LLM Fundamentals:\n  - Model architecture (Subsection “Model Architecture”):\n    - The differences among encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only models are explained with causal vs bidirectional attention and cross-attention, linking architecture choices to task suitability. This evidences underlying mechanisms rather than surface descriptions (“Causal decoders… allowing each token to attend only to its past tokens and itself”; “non-causal decoders resemble encoder-decoder frameworks”).\n  - Fine-tuning (Subsection “LLM Fine-tuning”):\n    - Clear trade-offs and limitations are articulated: “RLHF can be computationally intensive and complex” and “DPO… eliminates the need for a reward model… [but] both RLHF and DPO depend on high-quality human preference data.” The discussion of Constitutional AI and RLAIF addresses practical constraints (limited/expensive human feedback) and proposes mechanism-driven alternatives (AI feedback generation).\n  - Prompt engineering (Subsection “LLM Inference and Utilization by Prompting”):\n    - The paper doesn’t just list techniques; it explains when and why they work. For ICL, it analyzes demonstration selection/format/order and the underlying mechanisms (“task recognition” vs “task learning,” with larger LLMs showing enhanced demonstration learning). For CoT, it details benefits on “complex reasoning tasks” and acknowledges challenges (“incorrect reasoning and instability”), proposing strategies like verification and tree-structured reasoning. It also notes CoT’s scaling behavior (“significantly benefits large-scale LLMs (over 10B parameters)” but “may underperform in simpler tasks”).\n  - Evaluation metrics:\n    - The critique of common metrics (ROUGE, BERTScore) for factual consistency and mention of hallucination-specific metrics (AlignScore) reflect technical awareness of evaluation limitations. Efficiency and environmental cost (“LLM expands… issues regarding environmental sustainability”) are explicitly recognized with implications for telecom deployment.\n\n- Deployment analysis (Subsection “LLM Deployment in Telecom Networks” and Table “Summary of LLM deployment strategies”):\n  - The paper provides a strong trade-off analysis across cloud, edge, on-device, cache-based, and cooperative deployment, discussing latency, bandwidth, storage/compute constraints, and coordination overhead (“quantized parameters in the edge cloud… frozen parameters at user devices” and the need for “complicated coordination… update/synchronization frequency”). These are operationally grounded, telecom-specific arguments rather than generalities.\n\n- Application-focused critical analyses:\n  - Generation (Section “LLM for Generation Problems in Wireless Networks”):\n    - The authors are not merely optimistic; they flag reliability risks and validation needs: “the models may generate misleading or even wrong solutions… verification is crucial,” with reasons tied to “different data sources, training strategies.” This acknowledges failure modes and required mitigations.\n  - Classification (Section “LLM-enabled Classification Problems”):\n    - Security and attack detection analysis explains why general-domain LLMs may underperform (“security language… differs… making it challenging to understand specialized vocabulary”) and motivates security-specific tokenizers and corpora (SecureBERT). It also surfaces an important assumption and vulnerability in pre-training for traffic classification: “assumption of clean pre-training data… attackers craft a poisoned model with backdoors by inserting low-frequency words,” linking a concrete mechanism (toxic embeddings) to a failure mode.\n  - Optimization (Section “LLM-enabled Optimization Techniques for telecom”):\n    - Reward function design: The survey explains the fundamental difficulty (trial-and-error, unintended behaviors) and proposes a structured LLM-based formulation with explicit components (task/objective/states/actions/examples, mapping function M) and iterative feedback/self-refinement loops, articulating the mechanism of improvement. It also candidly notes constraints (“very early stage… few applications in telecom”).\n    - Verbal reinforcement learning: The paper articulates a principled agent framework (actor/evaluator/self-reflection/memory), ties it to interpretable, instruction-following behavior, and flags classic RL issues (exploration-exploitation), again grounding analysis in telecom decision-making contexts.\n    - Black-box optimization: It explains the appeal (avoid bespoke modeling) and the key limitation (“performance cannot be guaranteed… relies on quality of examples”), explicitly connecting to telecom’s reliability requirements.\n    - Convex optimization: The survey details an end-to-end LLM workflow (problem modeling, code generation, solver execution, automatic fixes) and recognizes the hard cases (“highly non-convex… coupled variables… require dedicated human effort”), thus acknowledging practical limits and pointing to where LLM support is most feasible.\n  - Prediction (Section “Time Series LLM for Prediction Problems”):\n    - Encoder-decoder vs decoder-only trade-offs are explored with attention mechanisms and expressibility considerations (later noting decoder-only attention matrices being triangular/full-column rank). Tokenization “patching” is justified with compute/memory reduction and applicability to telecom’s scale. The frozen/preprocessing-based approaches and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA/LNT) are explained with clear rationale (efficiency constraints at edge/mobile) and concrete guidance on where each makes sense (short-term predictions, zero-shot vs fine-tuned specialization). Multi-modality is connected to sensing and telecom-specific contexts (CSI, mmWave beamforming, traffic influenced by weather), not just described generically.\n\n- Challenges and Future Directions:\n  - The challenges section gives thoughtful, telecom-grounded commentary: dataset scarcity/coverage across standards/troubleshooting/Q&A; deployment latency and bandwidth constraints; prompt-engineering difficulty balancing specificity/generalization/context; retrieval-augmented efficiency costs; hallucination mitigation; and economic constraints with concrete cost figures and small-model alternatives (GPT-4o mini, Llama3-8b). This section is especially strong in connecting methodological limitations to telecom operational realities.\n\nWhere the analysis is weaker or uneven:\n- In some places, the discussion remains largely descriptive or aspirational, especially around multi-modal prediction and certain application frameworks (e.g., configuration generation) where deeper failure-mode analysis or empirical comparisons are limited. The “Related Surveys” section primarily contrasts topical coverage rather than probing underlying methodological causes in those prior works. Some claims (e.g., decoder-only attention expressibility) are referenced but not explored in detail across diverse telecom tasks.\n- Several sections summarize many techniques rapidly without consistently analyzing assumptions or boundary conditions (e.g., pre-training scalability techniques, 3D parallelism, ZeRO), which are introduced more as an inventory than as a critical analysis of trade-offs for telecom-specific deployments.\n\nOverall, the survey demonstrates strong analytical interpretation and technically grounded commentary in multiple sections, linking mechanisms to telecom constraints, but the depth varies across topics. Hence, a score of 4 is appropriate.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe “Challenges and Future Directions of LLM-empowered telecom” section systematically identifies a broad set of research gaps and future work items across data, methods/algorithms, systems deployment, and practical constraints. It generally explains why these issues matter and hints at their impact on the field, but the depth of analysis is uneven across items, with several gaps discussed at a high level rather than deeply unpacked.\n\nEvidence supporting the score:\n\n1) Data and training gaps (clearly identified, with meaningful impact discussion)\n- In “Telecom-domain LLM training,” the paper explicitly highlights the scarcity and fragmentation of telecom-specific datasets and the difficulty of collecting comprehensive corpora (“Sufficient telecom-related datasets are prerequisites… obtaining a sizable dataset exclusively focused on communication networks can be challenging.”). It ties this to practical impact by noting privacy, diversity of sources, and the need to balance model size and performance for feasibility (“balancing model size and performance is crucial… model compression, knowledge distillation… to reduce the model’s size and enhance its efficiency…”).\n- The inclusion of Table “Summary of Telecom datasets for LLM” shows an awareness of current resources and underscores the gap in breadth, scale, and openness across tasks (summarization, QA, classification), which directly impacts the ability to train robust telecom-domain LLMs.\n\n2) Deployment and systems constraints (well articulated with consequences)\n- “Practical LLM deployment in telecom” discusses stringent latency requirements for real-world applications (autonomous driving, robotic control), explaining why cloud-only solutions are inadequate (“central cloud-based LLM… task uploading and solution downloading may increase the service delay… the LLM inference time will also contribute to system latency… ranging from 0.58 to 90 seconds.”). It further analyzes edge deployment constraints (“edge servers… limited computational or storage capacity”) and proposes hybrid strategies while noting coordination challenges (“coordinating LLMs at different levels… selecting appropriate LLMs for diverse user tasks”).\n- This demonstrates both identification and impact analysis: the latency and capacity constraints directly affect feasibility and service quality for telecom URLLC-type scenarios.\n\n3) Methodological and interaction gaps (identified with rationale but not deeply developed)\n- “Prompt engineering for telecom applications” recognizes the complexity of crafting effective prompts due to the breadth of telecom concepts and the specificity–generality trade-off (“overly specific prompts may limit… general prompts may lead to irrelevant responses”). It notes the impact on accuracy and relevance and suggests standard prompting templates, but does not deeply analyze mechanisms or provide a concrete framework for evaluation or design across task classes. The importance is clear, but the discussion remains relatively high-level.\n- “LLM-enabled planning in telecom” points out that “recent benchmarks have shown that LLMs struggle with tasks requiring complex planning,” and explains why this matters (many telecom tasks need multi-step scheduling). It proposes plausible directions (automated task decomposition, simulation-environment training), which shows awareness of methodological gaps and impact, though the analysis stops short of a detailed plan for how to operationalize these in telecom-specific pipelines.\n\n4) Reliability, efficiency, and cost gaps (well motivated with clear implications)\n- “Overcoming hallucination problems in telecom applications” clearly describes the risk to reliability (“Hallucination… can severely undermine the reliability and credibility…”) and suggests mitigation (post-generation verification, external knowledge bases, real-time fact-checking, adversarial testing). The potential impact on trust and safety in telecom operations is explicit.\n- “Retrieval augmented-LLM for telecom” identifies an important trade-off: improved relevance vs. increased context length and computational cost that harms latency (“slow-response issues… may prevent the application of some scenarios with tight delay budget”). This is a strong articulation of impact and an area where telecom requirements differ from general NLP.\n- “Economic and affordable LLMs” gives concrete training and inference cost examples (“GPT-4 exceeded $100 million… LLaMa2 70B… $1.7 million… using GPT-4 for customer service… more than $21,000 per month”) and argues for small models (GPT-4o mini, Llama3-8b) as pragmatic paths. The financial impact on adoption is clearly presented.\n\n5) Multi-modal and optimization gaps (identified with motivation; mixed depth)\n- “Multi-modal LLMs for telecom” and “Multi-modal LLM for Telecom Prediction” explain why multi-modality is crucial (sensing in 6G, environment-aware CSI and beamforming), and how it could improve prediction and management. The impact is clearly motivational (more accurate CSI, blockage prediction, QoE), though the section is more prospective than deeply analytical about technical barriers (e.g., calibration across modalities, data alignment, real-time fusion constraints).\n- “LLM for resource allocation and network optimization” and “LLM-enhanced machine learning for telecom” recognize integration gaps (e.g., reward design, coupling of control variables) and present advantages (language-guided optimization, interpretability) alongside challenges (complex optimization structure). The analysis is sound but somewhat brief; it lists opportunities and high-level obstacles without detailed methodological pathways or risk models.\n\nWhy not a 5:\n- Although the section covers many major gaps across data, methods, deployment, reliability, and cost, the depth of analysis varies. Several items (prompt engineering standards, multi-step planning integration, multi-modal fusion challenges, telecom-specific benchmarking and evaluation frameworks, privacy and governance beyond brief mentions, robustness to adversarial telecom inputs) are noted but not deeply explored in terms of root causes, technical barriers, and structured impact pathways or prioritization.\n- The discussion often proposes directions (e.g., standard prompt templates, hybrid deployment, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, retrieval optimization) but stops short of a detailed roadmap or taxonomy of gaps with measurable consequences and research milestones.\n\nOverall, the section merits 4 points: it is comprehensive and well-motivated, with clear articulation of why these gaps matter to telecom and their likely impact, but several areas would benefit from deeper technical analysis and more concrete frameworks to reach a “5” level.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe paper proposes several forward-looking research directions that are clearly grounded in identified research gaps and real-world telecom needs, but the analysis of their potential impact and the actionable pathways is somewhat brief in places.\n\nEvidence of strong gap identification tied to future directions:\n- In “Challenges of Applying LLM Techniques to Telecom,” the authors articulate specific gaps:\n  - Telecom-domain LLM training: scarcity and fragmentation of domain datasets, heterogeneity of telecom concepts, and the need to balance model size and performance (“Sufficient telecom-related datasets are prerequisites…”, “telecom networks involve a large number of various concepts…”, and the discussion on model size/performance trade-offs).\n  - Practical LLM deployment in telecom: latency constraints for real-time use cases (autonomous driving, robotics), limited edge resources, and coordination across cloud/edge/device (“stringent requirements for service delay…”, “network edge servers have limited computational or storage capacity…”).\n  - Prompt engineering: difficulty of crafting effective prompts due to domain complexity and the need to balance specificity and generality (“Prompt engineering is a crucial aspect…”, “telecom networks encompass a wide range of concepts…”, and the suggestion to publicize standard prompting templates).\n\nThese challenges are then directly addressed in “Future Directions” with coherent and relevant topics:\n- Multi-modal LLMs for telecom: targets 6G sensing and real-world network dynamics by proposing multi-modal inputs (text, images, LiDAR, video) for CSI prediction and mmWave/THz beamforming with explicit telecom examples (“predict signal transmission blockage…”, “better CSI estimation results…”). This aligns well with the sensing gap and offers a concrete application track.\n- LLM-enabled planning in telecom: responds to the multi-step complexity gap with suggestions like automated task decomposition and integrating simulation environments (“developing better algorithms for planning…”, “integrating simulation environments directly within the training process…”).\n- Model compression and fast inference: addresses edge deployment constraints, proposing compression, pruning, and defining standard telecom evaluation metrics (“compressing the model size…”, “calls for novel model compression and pruning techniques…”, “standard metrics must be defined…”).\n- Overcoming hallucination problems: maps to reliability gaps in telecom by recommending post-generation verification, external knowledge bases, real-time fact-checking, and adversarial testing (“developing methods to reduce hallucination…”, “incorporating cross-referencing mechanisms…”, “adversarial testing…”).\n- Retrieval augmented-LLM for telecom: explicitly couples RAG with latency and efficiency constraints, suggesting optimized indexing and dynamic retrieval volume (“optimizing retrieval mechanisms…”, “dynamically adjusting the amount of retrieved information…”).\n- Economic and affordable LLMs: confronts cost barriers with concrete recommendations and pricing details (e.g., GPT-4o mini token costs), linking directly to practical viability (“Priced at just $0.15 per million input tokens…”, “telecom companies can use GPT-4o mini for customer support chatbots…”).\n- Real-world implementations: shows practical pathways through on-device LLM advances (Apple’s flash-based inference, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon platform) and natural language data access (SQL-GPT), clearly tying to real deployment scenarios (“efficiently running LLMs on devices with limited DRAM…”, “on-device AI into smartphones…”).\n\nInnovative topics and telecom specificity:\n- The multi-modal LLM direction is notably innovative in the telecom context, with detailed scenarios (CSI, beamforming, QoE) and explicit modality combinations that go beyond generic LLM discussions.\n- The planning direction acknowledges current LLM limitations and suggests concrete mechanisms (structured reasoning frameworks, simulation-based training) relevant to telecom’s multi-layer control and optimization tasks.\n- The retrieval augmentation efficiency angle is tailored to telecom’s latency constraints, which reflects real-world operational needs.\n- The cost-focused direction is pragmatic and actionable, offering specific model choices and use cases tied to telecom operations.\n\nWhere the paper falls short of a perfect score:\n- While future directions are well-chosen and clearly linked to gaps, many sections stop at high-level recommendations without laying out detailed, actionable research roadmaps (e.g., specific benchmarks, datasets, evaluation protocols, or step-by-step methodologies to operationalize proposals). For instance:\n  - “LLM-enabled planning in telecom” proposes automated task decomposition and simulation integration but does not outline concrete frameworks or metrics to evaluate planning quality in telecom settings.\n  - “Model compression and fast inference” and “Retrieval augmented-LLM” identify the right levers but remain general about algorithmic choices and performance trade-off quantification for telecom-grade latency and reliability.\n  - “LLM for resource allocation and network optimization” recognizes the promise and challenges but offers limited specificity on how to systematically integrate LLMs into complex coupled optimization tasks beyond acknowledging their interpretability and instruction-following strengths.\n\nOverall, the Future Directions section is comprehensive, addresses real-world telecom constraints, and proposes multiple innovative themes with clear relevance. The analysis is solid but could benefit from deeper elaboration on academic and practical impact with more concrete, actionable paths. Hence, a score of 4 is appropriate."]}
