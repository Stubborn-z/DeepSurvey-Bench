The authors explicitly position the work as a comprehensive survey of controllable text generation (CTG) using transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs). In the Introduction, they write: “In this paper, we provide an introduction to the main tasks and evaluation metrics related to CTG, a dedicated and comprehensive literature review on CTG approaches using PLMs, and finally, an outlook on the possible future research directions.” They further clarify the scope and organization: “The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section… gives a brief introduction… Then, we divide the main approaches… Section… summarizes… In Section… we discuss the challenges… Finally, we conclude…” This shows a well-defined survey plan with coverage of tasks, approaches, evaluation, challenges, and future directions, which aligns closely with the core issues in CTG.\n- Background and Motivation: The Introduction provides a solid motivation for the survey. It explains:\n  - The distinction between NLU and NLG and why controllability matters in NLG (“Making text generation controllable is an important and fundamental issue… dialogue, storytelling, data augmentation, debiasing, ethical development”).\n  - Historical context and limitations of earlier DL methods (VAEs, GANs, EBM) and their dependency on data.\n  - The rise of PLMs and their strengths for NLG (“PLMs have learned a great deal of semantic and syntactic knowledge… able to generate texts of unprecedented quality”) and the key challenge (“black boxes, lacking interpretability… difficult to control them to generate content as what the human want”).\n  - The gap in existing surveys: “There are some existing surveys on CTG, but it lacks (1) a systematic review… (2) a tracking of the latest large-scale PLM-based CTG approaches.”\n  - Inclusion criteria for literature (“All the literature appearing in this paper is filtered following two rules… latest papers within 3-4 years; influential works…”).\n  These points collectively justify the need for an up-to-date, PLM-focused CTG survey and support the paper’s objectives.\n- Practical Significance and Guidance Value: The Introduction articulates clear academic and practical value. It emphasizes applications (dialogue, storytelling, debiasing, data-to-text) and the importance of controllability for real-world use. It frames the survey as helpful to researchers and practitioners: “We hope that this survey paper will help researchers and practitioners to quickly capture the overall picture as well as detailed cutting-edge methods in PLM-based CTG, and promote the further development of this promising area.” The promise of a roadmap and identification of challenges and future directions further enhances guidance value.\n\nReasons for not assigning 5:\n- The Abstract is missing from the provided text. For a survey, a concise abstract that summarizes the scope, taxonomy, key findings, and contributions is crucial for objective clarity and quick reader orientation.\n- While the Introduction states the aim and organization well, it could benefit from sharper articulation of the survey’s specific contributions (e.g., an explicit bullet list of contributions, defined research questions, and a more detailed methodology for literature selection beyond the two general rules).\n- Minor issues (formatting artifacts, placeholder-like citations, and some verbosity) slightly detract from the crispness of the objective presentation.\n\nOverall, the Introduction makes the goal and motivation clear, aligns with the field’s core issues, and signals practical and academic relevance. With an abstract and a more explicit contributions/methodology statement, this would reach a 5.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\n- Method classification clarity: The paper presents a clear, reasonable, and well-motivated classification scheme for PLM-based controllable text generation. In “Main Approaches to PLM-based CTG,” it explicitly divides methods into three top-level categories based on how control signals interact with PLMs: Fine-tuning, Retraining/Refactoring, and Post-Processing (“According to the way how the control signal works, we have roughly divided the existing methods into three categories…” in Overview). Each category is further subdivided into coherent subcategories:\n  - Fine-tuning: Adapted Module, Prompt, Reinforcement Learning, Instruction Tuning (Section Fine-tuning).\n  - Retraining/Refactoring: Retrain and Refact (Section Retraining/Refactoring).\n  - Post-Processing: Guided Strategies and Trainable Strategies (Section Post-Processing).\n  The paper consistently explains the design rationale for each category (e.g., training cost vs. inference efficiency, model freezing vs. adaptation), and highlights trade-offs (e.g., “post-process… decoupled from the PLMs… computationally expensive (i.e., with longer inference time or additional parameters), and the quality of generated text can be low” in Summary of approaches). The summary table (“A summary of the surveyed CTG methods…”) further consolidates the categories, their characteristics, and representative references, reinforcing clarity.\n\n- Evolution of methodology: The paper does present an evolutionary view, though not strictly chronological across all categories. It traces:\n  - The broader field’s progression from early RNN/VAEs/GANs to Transformer-based PLMs (“Early approaches are based on sequential models… After that, there is a surge of methods… Since 2018, large-scale pre-trained Language models (PLMs)… have gradually become a new paradigm” in Introduction).\n  - Within prompts, a clear progression is articulated from manual templates to automated discrete prompts to continuous prompts (“The prompt-based approach has gone through various stages, from manual template construction… to automated search… and to continuous virtual token representations” in Prompt), followed by more recent variants (prefix-tuning, P-tuning), multi-attribute prompt control (Tailor), and fine-grained prompting (non-residual prompting).\n  - The emergence and scaling of instruction tuning is covered as a recent trend with FLAN, FLAN scaling, and InstructGPT (“Recently, a new PLM-based CTG paradigm, namely instruction tuning, has become popular… Google Research proposes FLAN… Continuing the work of FLAN… InstructGPT…” in Instruction Tuning).\n  - For post-processing, the paper maps a path from gradient-guided approaches (PPLM) to discriminator-guided methods (DAS, GeDi, DEXPERTS, FUDGE), then to training-free plug-and-play shifts (K2T), and finally to energy-based and iterative methods (Mix and Match, COLD Decoding), noting efficiency and quality trade-offs (Post-Processing; Guided Strategies; Trainable Strategies).\n  - It also connects methodological trends to external drivers, e.g., “As the parameter size of PLMs increase rapidly… post-processing… have emerged” (Overview), showing why decoding-time control gained traction.\n\n- Reasons for not assigning 5:\n  - Some overlaps and blurred boundaries reduce the sense of a fully systematic evolution. For instance, InstructGPT appears under both Reinforcement Learning (via RLHF) and Instruction Tuning, but the relationship between those two subcategories is not explicitly disentangled, which can be confusing (Fine-tuning: Reinforcement Learning; Instruction Tuning sections and the table list “instructgpt” in both).\n  - The “Retraining/Refactoring” category mixes training-from-scratch (CTRL) with architecture modifications atop existing PLMs (CoCon, Mention Flags, CBART), which is reasonable but could benefit from a crisper articulation of how refactoring emerged from retraining and the conditions under which each is favored.\n  - While the paper provides evolutionary notes within subareas (prompts, instruction tuning, post-processing), a more explicit, unified chronological narrative across all categories (e.g., a timeline or discussion of how and why the field shifted from fine-tuning to decoding-time control and back toward alignment/EBMs) would make the evolution more systematic.\n\nOverall, the classification is strong and the evolution is meaningfully conveyed, with clear connections and trends across major strands. Minor category overlaps and the lack of a unified timeline prevent a top score.", "Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\n- Diversity and detail of evaluation metrics: Strong. Section “Evaluation Methods” provides a broad and well-structured coverage of metrics across multiple categories. In “General NLG Evaluation Metrics,” the paper distinguishes human-centric (direct and indirect) and automatic metrics, and further breaks automatic metrics into lexical-, syntactic-, and semantic-based measures. It describes BLEU (“BLEU counts the n-gram matches…”, with an explicit BLEU-n formula), Self-BLEU (“Self-BLEU…to measure the diversity of the generated text”), ROUGE (with the ROUGE-n formula and precision/recall distinction vs. BLEU), Perplexity and Reverse PPL (“Perplexity (PPL) is a metric…Reverse PPL…to measure the diversity”), and Distinct-n. It also includes syntactic TESLA (“A common syntactic-based metric is TESLA…with TESLA-M/B/F variants”) and semantic measures such as BERTScore, YiSi, BLEURT (“BLEURT…a task-specific pre-trained model…robust to both domain and quality drifts”), and MAUVE (“compares the machine-generated text distribution to that of human-written text…using divergence frontiers”). The “Semi-automatic Evaluation Metrics” subsection further discusses hybrid approaches (e.g., Lowe 2017; Hashimoto 2019). For CTG-specific evaluation, the paper covers semantic consistency via trained classifiers and Accuracy (“We first need to construct a training set…Then a classifier is trained…Accuracy is always used…”), CTRLEVAL (“a PLM-based and reference-free method…coherence, consistency and attribute relevance”), and rule-based measures like Coverage and Success Rate for lexical and structural control. The “Summary” of the evaluation section explicitly reflects on strengths/weaknesses of human vs. automatic vs. semi-automatic methods, showing sound rationale (e.g., “Expensive and time-consuming…lack of consistency” for human-centric; “automatic…easy to use…less precise than human assessments”). Overall, the metric coverage is diverse, technically grounded, and practically meaningful.\n\n- Dataset coverage: Weak and insufficient. While the paper surveys tasks (“Tasks and Applications Involving CTG” lists Attribute-based Generation, Dialogue Generation, Storytelling, Data to Text, Data Augmentation, Debiasing, Format Control Tasks) and mentions a Table (~ctg_task) that “summarizes typical tasks and applications involving CTG,” the provided content does not actually enumerate datasets, nor does it offer detailed dataset descriptions (scale, domains, languages, annotation/labeling methods, splits). References to data are incidental and lack detail: e.g., “Recent work has found that fine-tuning PLMs on the target data, such as AMR-to-text~dart,plm_amr,t2t_plm…” mentions AMR-to-text and DART only in passing without describing size, annotation, or usage; “structAdapter…achieves the SOTA performance on two AMR-to-text benchmarks” again cites benchmarks but provides no specifics; “CTRL…trains a language model…on a 140Gb corpus” reports pretraining corpus scale but is not a CTG benchmark dataset overview. Across sections (Fine-tuning, Retraining/Refactoring, Post-Processing), many works are cited, yet there is no consolidated dataset table or narrative that characterizes the major CTG datasets (e.g., for sentiment/style control, dialogue persona control, toxicity control, story generation, data-to-text) with their scales and labeling schemes. Therefore, the diversity and rationality of dataset coverage do not meet the survey standards implied by the scoring rubric.\n\n- Rationality of metrics: Good. The paper aligns metrics to goals (fluency, factuality, grammar, diversity) and CTG-specific needs (constraint satisfaction via classifiers, rule-based checks). It discusses pros/cons and practical considerations (e.g., human evaluation costs/quality control; automatic metrics’ limitations; semi-automatic attempts to bridge the gap). This shows academically sound and practically meaningful choices.\n\nGiven the strong, detailed metric coverage but minimal dataset coverage and lack of dataset specifics, the section merits 3 points. To reach a higher score, the survey should add a dedicated dataset overview (by CTG task and control type) with dataset names, domains, sizes, languages, labeling methods, typical splits, and commonly used metrics per dataset.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey offers a clear, reasonably systematic, and technically grounded comparison of controllable text generation methods, organized into three macro categories—Fine-tuning, Retraining/Refactoring, and Post-Processing—with eight subcategories. It discusses advantages, disadvantages, and distinctions across meaningful dimensions such as training/inference cost, controllability, text quality, architectural choices, and data dependency. However, while the comparisons are strong, some dimensions (e.g., task/application mapping, quantitative performance trade-offs across benchmarks, unified assumptions) are not exhaustively elaborated, which prevents a full score.\n\nEvidence supporting the score:\n\n- Systematic categorization and framing:\n  - In “Main Approaches to PLM-based CTG,” the paper structures methods “into three categories” based on “the way how the control signal works” (Overview), and further into subcategories (Fine-tuning: Adapted Module, Prompt, Reinforcement Learning, Instruction Tuning; Retraining/Refactoring: Retrain, Refactor; Post-Processing: Guided Strategies, Trainable Strategies). This provides a clear comparative scaffold rather than a simple listing.\n\n- Comparison across multiple dimensions (training cost, inference efficiency, controllability, text quality):\n  - The “Overview” and “Summary” sections explicitly discuss trade-offs:\n    - “As the parameter size of PLMs increase rapidly… the third category of text generation methods, namely post-processing… have emerged. … Such methods not only require less computation resources for training…” (Overview), contrasted later with “most current decoding-time approaches… are still computationally expensive (i.e., with longer inference time or additional parameters), and the quality of generated text can be low” (Summary).\n  - The table (“A summary of the surveyed CTG methods”) codifies category-level characteristics:\n    - Fine-tuning: “standard training; efficient inference; higher text quality; weaker controllability.”\n    - Retrain/Refactor: “computationally expensive training; higher text quality; better controllability.”\n    - Post-Process: “efficient training and inefficient inference; lower text quality; better controllability.”\n    This shows an explicit, structured comparison of pros/cons across categories.\n\n- Architectural, objective, and assumption-level distinctions:\n  - Fine-tuning with Adapted Modules: “an adapter module is added after the feed-forward sub-layer of each layer… the PLM’s parameters are frozen” (structAdapter) versus auxiliary modules that “add its logits to the PLM’s logits” (Auxiliary Tuning). This contrasts injection points and training assumptions.\n  - Prompt-based methods: “freeze the PLM’s parameters” and optimize continuous prompts (prefix tuning) versus continuous virtual tokens and template learning (P-tuning), and multi-attribute strategies (Tailor). The discussion explicitly contrasts how control signals are formed and applied.\n  - RL-based fine-tuning: details of reward modeling, KL regularization to prevent loss of fluency—“a penalty item is added… KL(π, p)”—clearly differentiating objectives and constraints relative to standard fine-tuning.\n  - Retraining/Refactoring:\n    - CTRL’s conditional LM “p(x_i | x_<i, c)” on control codes (assumption: large-scale retraining).\n    - Insertion-based generation (POINTER) versus autoregressive generation (GPT-2), highlighting architectural differences and their impact on lexical constraint satisfaction and fluency.\n    - CBART’s two-step encoder/decoder workflow and parallel token prediction “to accelerate inference,” with explicit note on deviation from pre-training tasks and potential text quality impact.\n  - Post-Processing: Guided vs Trainable Strategies\n    - Guided: PPLM’s attribute classifier guiding hidden activations; GeDi’s CC-LM contrastive guidance—“two parallel forward passes”—explicitly contrasts mechanisms and efficiency.\n    - Trainable: EBM steering a frozen LM distribution via NCE; distributional policy gradient in GDC, highlighting the probabilistic modeling assumptions and global-normalization aims.\n\n- Advantages and disadvantages are clearly stated for many methods:\n  - PPLM: “significant improvement in attribute alignment… however, it causes a slight decrease in text fluency measured with… PPL.”\n  - GeDi: efficiency benefit from “two parallel forward passes of CC-LM.”\n  - K2T: “shift… may be too rough and cause the generated texts to fall short in fluency.”\n  - Mix and Match: “training-free… takes almost 11 seconds to generate a sequence of length 20,” highlighting practical efficiency limitations.\n  - Inverse Prompt: “takes up to around 10 minutes to generate a seven-word rhyming poem,” emphasizing inference cost.\n  - Non-residual prompting: “lacks a systematic comparison with… T5 and Bart… and its training process is complex so that it is not parameter-efficient,” reflecting critical assessment.\n  - Retraining/refactoring overall: “promising to substantially improve… but is limited by increased computing resource consumption and the lack of sufficient labeled data.”\n\n- Commonalities and distinctions:\n  - The “Overview” explicitly states the core idea: “give the model a control signal” and contrasts how each category interacts with PLMs (fine-tune parameters vs retrain/refactor architecture vs decoding-time control), identifying shared goals and differing mechanisms.\n  - “Post-Processing” section delineates the separation of the generation model and the guidance module (commonality of decoupling), versus Trainable Strategies integrating energy models with frozen LMs (distinction in learning strategy).\n\nWhere the comparison falls short (justifying 4 instead of 5):\n  - While category-level trade-offs are clear, the survey does not consistently map methods to specific application scenarios with systematic criteria (e.g., when to choose Guided vs Trainable decoding for particular control types or domains).\n  - Quantitative cross-benchmark comparisons are limited; the review relies on qualitative assessments and specific examples rather than a consolidated, metric-based synthesis across tasks.\n  - Assumptions are discussed (e.g., reliance on large PLMs; decoupled discriminators causing distribution gaps), but there is no unified comparative taxonomy aligning methods to assumptions about data availability, domain shift, or safety constraints.\n  - The critique of certain methods (e.g., Inverse Prompt runtime, Non-residual prompting’s parameter efficiency) is insightful but remains selective and not fully generalized across subcategories.\n\nOverall, the paper provides a robust, structured, and technically informed comparison of methods, with explicit trade-offs and architectural distinctions, but stops short of a fully comprehensive multidimensional synthesis that would merit a 5.", "Score: 4/5\n\nExplanation:\nThe review delivers meaningful, technically grounded analysis of method differences, design trade-offs, and underlying causes across the main research lines (fine-tuning, retraining/refactoring, and post-processing), but the depth is uneven—some subsections are more descriptive and lack deeper causal reasoning.\n\nEvidence of strong analytical reasoning and insight:\n- Foundational mechanisms and task-fit of PLM families are analyzed beyond description in “Transformer-based Pre-trained Language Models.” The paper explicitly connects architectural attention patterns to expressive power and downstream suitability: “Bi-attention models have been found to encounter low-rank problems… On the other hand, causal attention possesses greater theoretical expressive power… AR models… are a preferable choice. However, AR models also come with potential limitations for tasks such as fill-in-the-blank… summarization, which often require the model to look back…” This is a technically grounded explanation of why AE/Seq2Seq vs AR behave differently and how their assumptions affect controllability and task fit.\n- In “Overview” and “Summary” of the approaches, the authors synthesize design trade-offs across categories (training cost vs inference cost; quality vs controllability). For example, they argue why post-processing methods have emerged: “As the parameter size of PLMs increase rapidly… post-processing… have emerged… require less computation resources… and can guarantee a better quality of the generated text to some extent,” and later consolidate this in the table noting “efficient training and inefficient inference; lower text quality; better controllability” for post-processing, versus “higher text quality; weaker controllability” for fine-tuning. This reflects a systematic comparative view rather than mere listing.\n- Within fine-tuning, the RL subsection explains the fundamental cause of a key trade-off and the mitigation strategy: “To prevent π from moving too far away from the original PLM p for ensuring the fluency… a penalty item is added to the reward function during the actual process of fine-tuning π: R(x, y)=r(x, y)-β KL(π,p).” The commentary “The central challenge is to ensure that the PLM is optimized towards the RL’s rewards while maintaining the fluency… key is to achieve a better balance” interprets why RL methods can harm fluency and how the KL regularization addresses it.\n- The prompt-based subsection goes beyond description to critique and assess limitations. For example, about inverse prompting: “the generation process requires the reverse prediction for each candidate token, leading to an increased computation cost… it takes up to around 10 minutes to generate a seven-word rhyming poem, making it difficult to be applied in real application scenarios.” About non-residual prompting: “we hold a critical opinion on it, as it lacks a systematic comparison with the natural encoder-encoder architectures such as T5 and Bart, and its training process is complex so that it is not parameter-efficient.” These are insightful, evidence-based comments on efficiency and methodological gaps, not just summaries.\n- In post-processing, the guided strategies analysis references concrete mechanisms and their implications. For PPLM: “able to achieve a significant improvement in attribute alignment. However, it causes a slight decrease in text fluency measured with… PPL,” highlighting a quality–control tension. For GeDi, the paper explains the Bayes-style contrastive mechanism that combines CC-LM probabilities with PLM probabilities (“During the generation step… P_w(x_t|x_<t,c) ∝ P_LM(x_t|x_<t) P_θ(c|x_t, x_<t)”), and motivates efficiency (“only needs two parallel forward passes of CC-LM”), connecting method design to computational trade-offs.\n- Trainable post-processing strategies are framed with theoretical grounding (Energy-Based Models, NCE, distributional constraints). The EBM subsection articulates the joint model and training approach (“P_θ(x) ∝ P_LM(x) exp(-E_θ(x))… NCE is used to train the model to cope with the intractability issue”) and interprets why large PLMs make this feasible (“quality… relies heavily on the quality of the underlying language model”). The distributional approach (“unifies the point-wise and distributional-wise constraints… suffers from the high computational cost”) connects probabilistic formulation to practical limitations.\n- The “Challenges” section synthesizes cross-cutting fundamental causes that affect methods and controllability, e.g., “distribution gap between the discriminator and the generator, leading to a coarser granularity in the guidance process,” and “local normalization format has certain limitations in paragraph/document-level modeling… hard to keep long-range coherence.” These are deeper structural observations that interpret why certain control paradigms (especially decoding-time control for long texts) struggle.\n\nWhere the analysis is less deep or uneven:\n- Some subsections are predominantly descriptive without probing assumptions or causal mechanisms. For example, the “Adapted Module” part mainly catalogs adapter designs and outcomes with limited discussion of underlying reasons why these modules mitigate catastrophic forgetting or how they influence PLM representations (e.g., “structAdapter… encode the graph structure into the PLMs without contaminating its original distributional knowledge,” but the rationale for “without contaminating” is asserted rather than analyzed).\n- The retraining/refactoring section offers limited mechanistic interpretation for methods like CBART beyond “training and inference processes are different from the original pre-training tasks, which can lead to a negative impact on the quality of text generation.” It does not unpack why parallel decoding or insertion/replacement alters learned distributional priors or coherence, so the causal analysis remains shallow here.\n- Some method clusters (e.g., multi-attribute prompt strategies like Tailor) are introduced with basic pros/cons but not explored in terms of interaction effects, conflicts between attributes, or theoretical constraints.\n\nOverall judgment:\nThe survey goes beyond listing methods. It identifies and explains several fundamental causes (attention mechanisms, normalization, KL regularization, discriminator–generator distribution gaps), analyzes key trade-offs (quality vs controllability; training vs inference efficiency), and offers critical commentary supported by empirical observations (e.g., run-time tests, PPL impacts). It also synthesizes connections between probabilistic models (EBMs, distributional constraints) and PLM-based generation. However, the depth varies by subsection; some areas remain mostly descriptive, which prevents a top score.\n\nResearch guidance value:\nHigh. The paper’s comparative framing (three-category taxonomy with trade-off summaries), technically grounded critiques (e.g., RL regularization, GeDi’s contrastive mechanism, efficiency limits of inverse prompting), and articulated challenges (local normalization, discriminator–generator gap, long-range coherence) provide actionable guidance for choosing and improving CTG approaches under different resource and control requirements.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe paper’s “Challenges and Future Directions” section identifies multiple, substantive research gaps and connects them to plausible future work, but the analysis remains somewhat general and does not fully develop the impact or methodological implications of each gap. This warrants a strong score, though short of the highest mark reserved for deeply reasoned, impact-focused analyses.\n\nEvidence supporting the score:\n- Systematic identification of major gaps across methods, modeling, knowledge, evaluation, and benchmarking:\n  - Methods/decoding control: In “Challenges,” the second challenge explicitly states “there is a distribution gap between the discriminator and the generator, leading to a coarser granularity in the guidance process and decreased quality of the generated text. In addition, the decoding-time approaches are hard to be directly applied to fine-grained control scenarios such as data-to-text or multi-attribute control tasks.” This clearly surfaces limitations of post-processing/guided strategies and their practical impact on quality and applicability.\n  - Modeling (local vs. global control): The third challenge notes that “local normalization… has certain limitations in paragraph/document-level modeling… hard to keep long-range coherence… calls for further research to establish a global normalization based on PLMs to ensure that text generation can be controlled locally and globally at the same time.” This pinpoints a foundational modeling gap with explicit implications for coherence and controllability at longer horizons.\n  - Knowledge and generalization: The fourth challenge states “the knowledge captured in those models is often rather superficial… [PLMs] will lose generalization ability when the training data does not contain relevant commonsense and domain-specific knowledge… difficult to control the generated texts faithfully…” This gap is well framed around domain fidelity and commonsense, highlighting risks of hallucination and misalignment.\n  - Evaluation: The fifth challenge discusses the “lack of an objective, accurate and comprehensive evaluation mechanism that is fully compatible with human judgment,” and importantly ties the gap to its impact: “If the quality of the generated text of an NLG model cannot be accurately evaluated, it is hard to think of a way to control them.”\n  - Benchmarks/tasks: The final challenge emphasizes that “few of them are actually dedicated CTG tasks… need to come up with dedicated benchmarking tasks and datasets for CTG with diverse control requirements,” underscoring a data/benchmarking gap crucial for field progress.\n  - Catastrophic forgetting and domain diversity: The first challenge observes difficulty in “ensure[ing] the domain diversity… while pursuing controllability,” linking to the common issue of catastrophic forgetting in PLMs and the need for few/zero-shot methods.\n\n- Alignment of future directions with identified gaps, showing a coherent roadmap:\n  - Prompt-based Learning: Proposed to “overcome the problem of catastrophic forgetting” and improve zero/few-shot adaptability (addresses the first challenge).\n  - Fine-grained Decoding Control: Suggests “co-training between the guided model and the generative model… extend… to multi-attribute… in a unified framework,” directly answering the second challenge’s limits of guided decoding.\n  - Integration with Classic Generative Theory and Linguistic Knowledge: This targets the third challenge (global vs. local control) by proposing to bridge PLMs with GANs/VAEs/EBMs and incorporate linguistic structures for long text.\n  - Incorporation of External Knowledge: Addresses the fourth challenge on domain knowledge and commonsense (retrieval, knowledge graphs to reduce hallucinations and improve fidelity).\n  - Novel Evaluation Metrics and Methods: Responds to the fifth challenge by proposing PLM-based assessment and CTG-specific metrics.\n  - New CTG tasks: Tackles the final challenge via AGI-oriented benchmarks and value alignment constraints.\n\nWhy it is not a 5:\n- Depth of analysis is uneven and often high-level. While the gaps are well chosen, the section generally stops at identifying the issue and offering directional remedies; it does not deeply analyze root causes, trade-offs, or provide concrete methodological pathways or measurable impact claims.\n  - For example, the second challenge mentions a “distribution gap” and coarse guidance, but does not dive into why this gap arises (e.g., mismatch of training objectives, calibration issues, or inference-time objective misalignment) or how to quantify and mitigate it beyond a general co-training suggestion.\n  - The third challenge’s call for “global normalization” identifies a key theoretical limitation, but lacks discussion of feasibility, known attempts (e.g., energy-based decoders, diffusion models for LM), or implications for inference cost and stability.\n- Data dimension coverage is partial. The paper acknowledges the need for dedicated benchmarks and few/zero-shot adaptability, but does not analyze dataset biases, multilingual/low-resource settings, annotation quality/cost, or governance/privacy concerns as core gaps.\n- Safety, ethics, and alignment are acknowledged elsewhere in the paper but not substantively developed as research gaps here (e.g., toxicity control beyond metrics, robust safety mechanisms, adversarial robustness, or standardized alignment protocols).\n- Limited discussion of computational efficiency and scalability trade-offs as gaps (e.g., decoding-time methods’ latency and resource constraints, which are noted in other sections but not framed as a future-work priority in the gap analysis).\n\nOverall, the section does a commendable job of identifying key gaps and mapping them to future directions across multiple dimensions, but the lack of deeper impact analysis, methodological detail, and broader data/safety considerations keeps it at 4 points rather than 5.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\n- The paper clearly identifies key research gaps and real-world issues in “Challenges and Future Directions” and ties them to forward-looking directions in “Future Directions.” This warrants a strong score.\n- Strong articulation of gaps:\n  - Catastrophic forgetting and domain diversity: “it is still a challenge to overcome this problem and imporve the ability of the PLM-based NLG model to generate multi-domain text that satisfies specific control conditions, with few or zero domain-specific samples.” (Challenges)\n  - Decoding-time control limitations and distribution gap: “there is a distribution gap between the discriminator and the generator, leading to a coarser granularity in the guidance process and decreased quality of the generated text.” (Challenges)\n  - Local normalization limits long-range/global control: “it is hard to keep long-range coherence in terms of both semantic logic and controlled condition.” (Challenges)\n  - Lack of deep/domain knowledge and commonsense: “purely relying on PLMs could be difficult to control the generated texts faithfully with respect to commonsense and rich knowledge specific to the target domain.” (Challenges)\n  - Evaluation bottleneck: “there is still a lack of an objective, accurate and comprehensive evaluation mechanism that is fully compatible with human judgment.” (Challenges)\n  - Lack of dedicated benchmarks/datasets for CTG: “there is a need to come up with dedicated benchmarking tasks and datasets for CTG with diverse control requirements.” (Challenges)\n\n- Forward-looking directions aligned to these gaps and real-world needs:\n  - Prompt-based Learning as a way to reduce data needs and address catastrophic forgetting: “Based on the well-designed prompting function, a PLM is able to perform few-shot or even zero-shot learning… thus overcoming the problem of catastrophic forgetting.” This direction is timely given real-world constraints on labeled data and the need for domain adaptability. It connects to practical needs for efficient control in diverse domains. (Future Directions: Prompt-based Learning)\n  - Fine-grained Decoding Control for stronger controllability: “co-training between the guided model and the generative model ensures finer-grained text generation” and “extend… single-attribute… to multi-attribute controlled tasks in a unified framework.” These are concrete suggestions aimed at practical needs like multi-attribute control in dialogue/story generation. (Future Directions: Fine-grained Decoding Control)\n  - Integration with classic generative theory and linguistic knowledge to address global coherence and controllability: “combining classic probability theory… will help solve the problem at the theoretical level” and “combine linguistic knowledge with PLMs… to overcome… long text modeling.” This is innovative and directly targets the identified global control and long-range coherence gaps, with clear practical implications for document/story generation quality. (Future Directions: Integration with Classic Generative Theory and Linguistic Knowledge)\n  - Incorporation of External Knowledge to reduce hallucinations and improve domain faithfulness: “combine with information retrieval… alleviating problem of hallucinations” and “knowledge graph… provides effective reasoning mechanisms.” These suggestions address urgent real-world needs (accuracy, reliability, domain-specific reasoning) seen in applications like healthcare or customer service. (Future Directions: Incorporation of External Knowledge)\n  - Novel Evaluation Metrics using PLMs inversely: “applying them in reverse to assess the text quality… would be an interesting… area.” This directly responds to the evaluation bottleneck and aims for metrics that better align with human judgments—an important practical need. (Future Directions: Novel Evaluation Metrics and Methods)\n  - New CTG tasks and AGI-oriented benchmarks focusing on human value alignment and accuracy: “define AGI-oriented benchmarks… aligned with human values and does not have the harmful effects.” This is forward-looking and addresses safety/toxicity and truthfulness concerns that are central to real-world deployment. (Future Directions: New CTG tasks)\n\n- Why not 5 points:\n  - Although the directions are clearly connected to the identified gaps and real-world needs, the analysis of their academic and practical impact is relatively brief. For instance, “overcoming the problem of catastrophic forgetting” with prompts is asserted without a detailed mechanism or evaluation plan; “co-training between the guided model and the generative model” is suggested but lacks specifics on training signals, architectures, or trade-offs; “applying PLMs in reverse to assess text quality” is promising but not accompanied by concrete metric designs or validation protocols.\n  - The paper does not consistently provide a clear, actionable path (e.g., proposed datasets, experimental setups, measurable milestones) or a thorough impact analysis for each direction. The suggestions remain high-level in several places, with limited exploration of causes/impacts of the gaps and how the proposed solutions would concretely resolve them.\n  \nOverall, the section presents multiple innovative, forward-looking directions that are well aligned with the documented gaps and practical needs, but the depth of impact analysis and actionability is somewhat limited, aligning with a 4-point score."]}
