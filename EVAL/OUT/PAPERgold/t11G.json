{"name": "G", "paperour": [5, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], "reason": ["Score: 5\n\nExplanation:\n\n- Research Objective Clarity:\n  - The Introduction clearly articulates the survey’s objectives and scope. The authors state: “To address this gap, we conduct this survey to offer an in-depth and comprehensive analysis specifically focused on 2D image editing using diffusion models.” They further specify concrete deliverables: “The survey critically reviews over 100 research papers, organizing them into three primary classes—training-based approaches, testing-time finetuning approaches, and training and finetuning free approaches… We also explore 10 distinct types of input conditions… [and] present a new classification of image editing tasks into three broad categories.” This provides a clear, specific research aim and structure.\n  - The objectives are operationalized with explicit outputs: “We also introduce EditEval, a benchmark designed to evaluate text-guided image editing algorithms… [and] propose LMM Score.” The Introduction closes with a well-defined goal: “to provide a comprehensive resource that not only synthesizes current findings but also guides future research directions.”\n  - The scope boundaries are clearly defined in “Scope and Categorization,” including inclusion criteria (“the task must focus on image editing… and the methodology must depend on diffusion models… performed on 2D images”) and exclusions (traditional methods, other generative models, 3D knowledge). This sharpens the research direction and ensures alignment with the core issues in the field.\n\n- Background and Motivation:\n  - The Introduction provides a strong contextual motivation: it contrasts image editing with image generation and traces the evolution from manual methods to GANs and then diffusion models. It identifies a gap: “there is a notable lack of surveys specifically dedicated to diffusion model-based image editing,” and explains that existing surveys “tend to concentrate on other visual tasks” or offer only “a cursory overview… lacking a detailed and focused exploration.”\n  - The Background section further strengthens the foundation by summarizing diffusion models, attention mechanisms in Stable Diffusion, and related tasks (conditional generation, restoration, composition). This demonstrates comprehensive domain understanding and sets the stage for why a focused survey on editing is needed.\n\n- Practical Significance and Guidance Value:\n  - The work’s practical value is explicit and substantial:\n    - Organization and taxonomy: The three learning strategy classes, ten input conditions, and twelve editing types (organized into semantic, stylistic, structural) create a usable framework for researchers and practitioners. The large tables and taxonomies (“Table 1” and corresponding figures) provide actionable overviews.\n    - Benchmarking and metrics: Introducing EditEval and LMM Score addresses a known deficiency in evaluation resources. The authors justify LMM Score, detail its construction, and compare it against existing metrics, demonstrating its reliability and alignment with user judgments. This is of immediate practical utility to the community.\n    - Special focus areas: Inpainting/outpainting are treated as unique editing types with comprehensive coverage of traditional and multimodal methods, which adds targeted guidance for a frequently used subtask.\n    - Future directions and challenges: The “Challenges and Future Directions” section offers concrete, relevant avenues (efficiency, robustness, structural/lighting edits, high resolution, evaluation metrics), which enhances the survey’s guidance value beyond mere cataloging.\n\nOverall, the Introduction presents a precise, well-justified objective tied to a recognized gap, and the survey’s deliverables (taxonomy, benchmark, metric, special-topic analyses) give both academic and practical value. Minor improvement opportunities would be to include the Abstract content (not visible in the provided excerpt) and, in the Introduction, explicitly list research questions or a bullet list of contributions for quicker reader parsing. Nonetheless, based on the available sections, the objective clarity, motivation, and guidance value merit the highest score.", "Score: 5\n\nExplanation:\nThe paper presents a clear, multi-level, and well-justified classification of methods and systematically traces the evolution of diffusion-based image editing techniques across the field. The organization after the Introduction and before the Evaluation sections demonstrates both classification clarity and methodological progression.\n\n- Method Classification Clarity\n  - Scope and Categorization: The survey defines three top-level learning strategy groups—“Training-Based Approaches,” “Testing-Time Finetuning Approaches,” and “Training and Finetuning Free Approaches”—and motivates these groups by whether methods require training, test-time finetuning, or neither. This is explicitly stated in the “Scope and Categorization” section (“we organize diffusion model-based image editing papers into three principle groups…”). It also enumerates 10 input conditions and 12 editing types, providing a consistent multi-perspective lens for analysis.\n  - Comprehensive taxonomy artifacts: Table 1 and the taxonomy figures (forest diagrams) for training-based (Fig. taxonomy_of_training), finetuning approaches (Fig. taxonomy_of_finetuning), and training-free approaches (Fig. taxonomy_of_free) clearly list methods under coherent subcategories and visually reinforce the classification.\n  - Within-group substructure:\n    - Training-Based Approaches are broken down into “Domain-Specific Editing,” “Reference and Attribute Guided Editing,” “Instructional Editing,” and “Pseudo-Target Retrieval Based Editing,” each further split by core technical paradigms (e.g., in Domain-Specific Editing: CLIP Guidance; Cycling Regularization; Projection and Interpolation; Classifier Guidance).\n    - Testing-Time Finetuning Approaches are structured into “Denoising Model Finetuning,” “Embedding Finetuning,” “Guidance with a Hypernetwork,” “Latent Variable Optimization,” and “Hybrid Finetuning,” distinguishing full-model vs partial/layer finetuning and alternative optimization targets.\n    - Training and Finetuning Free Approaches are divided by what is modified: “Input Text Refinement,” “Inversion/Sampling Modification,” “Attention Modification,” “Mask Guidance,” and “Multi-Noise Redirection,” which is a principled differentiation aligned with the mechanics of diffusion inference.\n  - Inpainting and Outpainting are treated as a distinct sub-domain with their own two-tier structure (“Traditional Context-Driven Inpainting” and “Multimodal Conditional Inpainting”), plus “Outpainting,” reflecting the specificities of these tasks and further reinforcing classification clarity.\n\n- Evolution of Methodology\n  - Domain-Specific Editing: The section traces progression from CLIP-guided finetuning (DiffusionCLIP; Asyrp; EffDiff) to advances in style transfer (DiffStyler; StyleDiffusion), then to cyclic consistency frameworks (UNIT-DDPM; CycleNet), and projection/interpolation strategies (Diffusion Autoencoders; HDAE), culminating with classifier-guided sampling (EGSDE; Pixel-Guided Diffusion). This shows a clear trajectory from text/CLIP-based manipulation to stronger architectural and training regularization, and then to classifier-guided refinement.\n  - Instructional Editing: The evolution is explicitly anchored with “InstructPix2Pix is the first study…” and then systematically expands along well-defined axes: model architecture enhancement (MoEController; FoI), data quality improvement (LOFIE; MagicBrush; InstructDiffusion; Emu Edit; DialogPaint; Inst-Inpaint), human-feedback alignment (HIVE with RLHF), visual instruction (ImageBrush), and multimodal/LLM-driven approaches (InstructAny2Pix; MGIE; SmartEdit). This section very clearly demonstrates trends toward richer data, multimodal inputs, and leveraging LLMs for instruction interpretation and guidance.\n  - Testing-Time Finetuning: The paper presents a coherent evolution pathway: from whole-model finetuning (UniTune; Custom-Edit) to partial parameter finetuning (KV-Inversion), to embedding finetuning (Null-Text Inversion; DPL; DiffusionDisentanglement; Prompt Tuning Inversion), then guidance with auxiliary networks (StyleDiffusion; InST), direct latent optimization (DragonDiffusion; DragDiffusion; DDS; DiffuseIT; CDS), and hybrid schemes (Imagic; LayerDiffusion; Forgedit; SINE). This portrays a trend toward reducing training burdens, improving reconstruction fidelity, and using lighter-weight or more targeted finetuning techniques.\n  - Training-Free Approaches: The progression from basic inversion/sampling (Direct Inversion, DDPM Inversion) to memory-augmented reconstruction consistency (SDE-Drag; LEDITS++; FEC; EMILIE), null-text roles (Negative Inversion; ProxEdit; Null-Text Guidance), and multiple-noise prediction mechanisms (EDICT; AIDI) is explicitly discussed. The “Attention Modification” part highlights Prompt-to-Prompt (P2P) as the pioneering method and shows follow-on developments: attention map replacement (P2P; Pix2Pix-Zero), feature replacement (MasaCtrl; PnP), local attention map modification (TF-ICON; Object-Shape Variation), and attention score guidance (Conditional Score Guidance; EBMs). The “Mask Guidance” segment moves from efficiency (FISEdit; Blended Latent Diffusion; PFB-Diff) to auto-generation (DiffEdit; RDM; MFL) and region focus (Differential Diffusion; Watch Your Steps). “Multi-Noise Redirection” shows semantic control evolution (Stable Artist; SEGA; LEDITS) and object-aware refinement (OIR-Diffusion).\n  - Inpainting/Outpainting: The paper draws a line from supervised conditional diffusion (Palette; SUD^2) to zero-shot techniques with context priors (Repaint; GradPaint), linear inverse decompositions (DDRM; DDNM), and posterior estimation families (DPS; MCG; ΠGDM; GDP; CoPaint). It then transitions to multimodal conditional inpainting: from random mask training on large T2I backbones (GLIDE; Stable Inpainting) to precise control (SmartBrush; Imagen Editor; PbE; PhD; Uni-paint; PVA; SmartMask), and to exploiting pretrained priors efficiently (Blended Diffusion; Blended Latent Diffusion; Inpaint Anything; MagicRemover; HD-Painter). This clearly outlines how inpainting matured from unconditional/zero-shot priors to controllable, multimodal, and efficient pipelines.\n\n- Where the text supports these judgments:\n  - “Scope and Categorization” defines the top-level grouping and multi-perspective taxonomy.\n  - “Training-Based Approaches” is systematically divided and narrates intra-category evolution (e.g., the subheadings “CLIP Guidance,” “Cycling Regularization,” “Projection and Interpolation,” “Classifier Guidance”).\n  - “Instructional Editing” explicitly starts with “InstructPix2Pix Framework” and continues with structured subheadings mapping the evolution: “Model Architecture Enhancement,” “Data Quality Enhancement,” “Human Feedback-Enhanced Learning,” “Visual Instruction,” and “Leveraging Multimodal Large-Scale Models.”\n  - “Testing-Time Finetuning Approaches” presents progressive finetuning techniques and hybridization, with specific subheadings and method examples.\n  - “Training and Finetuning Free Approaches” uses principled subdivisions by what is modified and references foundational and subsequent methods, noting pioneering contributions (e.g., “P2P is the pioneering research”).\n  - “Inpainting and Outpainting” breaks down chronological and methodological developments into supervised, zero-shot, and multimodal strands, with clear technical rationales (context priors, decomposition, posterior estimation) and subsequent control enhancements.\n\nMinor limitations (which do not lower the score below 5):\n- Chronological timelines are largely implicit and thematic rather than explicitly dated; however, pioneering works and successive improvements are repeatedly identified (e.g., P2P, InstructPix2Pix, DDPM Inversion, GLIDE/Stable Inpainting), making the evolutionary path clear.\n- Cross-category interactions (e.g., how attention modifications impact training-free vs finetuning methods) are described conceptually but not always diagrammed; nonetheless, the taxonomy and narrative still make trends evident.\n\nOverall, the survey’s method classification is exceptionally clear, and the evolutionary development of techniques is systematically and insightfully presented, meeting the 5-point criteria.", "Score: 4/5\n\nExplanation:\n- Diversity of datasets:\n  - The survey references a broad set of datasets used across prior diffusion-based editing works, spanning domain-specific corpora and newly constructed instruction/editing datasets.\n    - Domain-specific datasets are explicitly named in “Domain-Specific Editing”: CelebA and FFHQ for human faces, AFHQ for animal faces, LSUN for objects, and WikiArt for style transfer (“train these models on smaller specialized datasets… CelebA… FFHQ… AFHQ… LSUN… WikiArt”).\n    - Instructional editing datasets are described with useful detail:\n      - MagicBrush: “comprises 5,313 edit sessions and 10,388 edit turns,” collected via AMT and DALL-E 2 (Section “Instructional Editing,” Data Quality Enhancement).\n      - Emu Edit: “a dataset comprising 16 distinct tasks with 10 million examples,” created via Llama 2 and in-context learning (same section).\n      - DialogPaint: multi-turn dialogue dataset built via self-instruct on GPT-3 and edited with four image editing models (same section).\n      - Inst-Inpaint: GQA-Inpaint constructed from the GQA dataset; masks produced via Detectron2 and Detic; targets via CRFill; instructions via templates (same section).\n      - InstructDiffusion: “not only utilizes existing datasets but also augments them with additional data… and real-world Photoshop requests” (same section).\n    - Inpainting/outpainting training sources and conditions:\n      - Random mask training: GLIDE and Stable Inpainting “use a randomly generated mask along with the masked image and the full image caption” (Section “Multimodal Conditional Inpainting,” Random Mask Training).\n      - Imagen Editor: masks “generated on-the-fly by an object detector, SSD Mobilenet v2,” not random (Precise Control Conditioning).\n      - Inpaint Anything: SAM is used to obtain regions (Pretrained Diffusion Prior Exploiting).\n    - Benchmarks in the field are discussed and contrasted: EditBench, TedBench, and EditVal are reviewed with limitations (Section “Benchmark Construction”).\n  - The survey introduces its own benchmark, EditEval, with clear scope and construction:\n    - “EditEval includes a carefully curated dataset of 150 high-quality images… accompanied by text prompts. EditEval evaluates performance on 7 common editing tasks…” (Section “Benchmark Construction”).\n    - Dataset details: selection from Unsplash, cropped to square, grouped by task, prompts/instructions generated via GPT-4V with templates and human verification; repository template is provided (Section “Dataset Construction”).\n  - While this is a good breadth, the evaluation itself relies on a relatively small curated set (150 images) and focuses on text-only methods for fair comparison (“the method must require only text conditions… exclude domain-specific methods,” Section “Method Selection”). This narrows evaluation diversity somewhat.\n\n- Diversity and rationale of metrics:\n  - The survey comprehensively discusses classical and recent metrics and introduces a new one:\n    - Existing metrics enumerated in “Faithful Evaluation Metrics” (Challenges): FID, KID, LPIPS, CLIP Score, PSNR, SSIM, along with newer ones DreamSim and Foreground Feature Averaging (FFA).\n    - It analyzes CLIPScore’s limitations for complex scenes and directional variants (“CLIPScore may struggle in complicated scenes… This limitation urges the need for a more versatile metric,” Section “Metric Design and Selection”).\n    - It introduces LMM Score with four sub-factors—Editing Accuracy, Contextual Preservation, Visual Quality, Logical Realism—each scored 1–10, and a weighted aggregation formula “S_LMM = 0.4×S_acc + 0.3×S_pre + 0.2×S_qua + 0.1×S_real” (same section). The factors and weights are motivated by GPT-4’s recommendations, and the metric is operationalized via GPT-4V with a provided template.\n    - It validates LMM Score through a user study of 50 participants scoring the same four dimensions, and shows high Pearson correlation between LMM sub-scores and user sub-scores across tasks (Section “Comparative Analysis,” Correlation discussion, and figure reference).\n    - It further compares LMM Score with CLIPScore, Directional CLIP Similarity, and TIFA Score, concluding that “LMM Score consistently exhibits the highest correlation with user evaluations across all tasks” (Section “LMM Score vs. Other Metrics”).\n  - This is academically thoughtful and practically meaningful: the metric targets editing-specific dimensions and is cross-validated with human judgments. The inclusion of comparisons with multiple baselines (CLIPScore, Directional CLIP Similarity, TIFA) strengthens the rationale.\n\n- Where the review falls short of a perfect score:\n  - The evaluation dataset is relatively small (150 images) and constrained to text-only methods, which limits empirical breadth across multimodal conditions (masks, sketches, layouts, audio) that the survey otherwise covers extensively in the taxonomy and method descriptions (e.g., masks, pose, segmentation, sketches listed throughout Table and method summaries).\n  - LMM Score’s weighting (“suggested by GPT-4”) could be seen as less rigorously justified than, for example, expert-designed or empirically optimized weightings; although the strong correlation with user studies partly mitigates this concern.\n  - The survey does not provide detailed scales/labeling schemes for every dataset mentioned across prior works (e.g., CelebA/FFHQ/AFHQ/LSUN/WikiArt are listed but not described in terms of splits or labeling), focusing instead on key datasets with novel annotation processes (MagicBrush, Emu Edit, DialogPaint, Inst-Inpaint).\n\nOverall, the paper covers multiple datasets and metrics with solid reasoning and validation, especially in its Benchmark and Evaluation section. The data and metric choices are explained and cross-checked against user studies, which is academically sound. A few constraints in scope and depth keep it from a perfect 5, hence a 4/5 score.", "Score: 4/5\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey provides a clear, structured, and technically grounded comparison of methods across multiple meaningful dimensions, but it falls slightly short of a fully systematic pros/cons analysis for each method or category.\n\nStrengths supporting the score:\n- Systematic taxonomy across learning strategies, input conditions, and task types:\n  - In “Scope and Categorization,” the paper explicitly organizes over 100 methods into three principal groups—training-based, testing-time finetuning, and training & finetuning free—while also enumerating 10 input conditions and 12 editing types. The large summarizing table (TABLE 1) offers a multi-perspective categorization, mapping methods to conditions and task capabilities. This shows a broad, systematic comparison scaffold, not just a list.\n- Multi-dimensional contrasts by technique, architecture, objectives, and assumptions:\n  - Training-Based Approaches:\n    - Domain-Specific Editing: The CLIP Guidance subsection contrasts DiffusionCLIP (“finetunes the pretrained diffusion model… constrained by a CLIP loss”) with Asyrp (“focuses on a semantic latent space internally, termed h-space… keeping the diffusion model frozen”), and EffDiff (“introduces a faster method with single-step training… to address the time-consuming problem of multi-step optimization”). It further differentiates DiffStyler vs. StyleDiffusion by their CLIP-based losses (instruction vs. style disentanglement), highlighting model objectives and optimization assumptions.\n    - Cycling Regularization vs. Projection/Interpolation vs. Classifier Guidance: UNIT-DDPM and CycleNet are contrasted as cycling/consistency regularization approaches, while Diffusion Autoencoders and HDAE are contrasted via projection into semantic/hierarchical spaces (noting HDAE’s critique that prior approaches “miss rich low-level and mid-level features”). EGSDE and Pixel-Guided Diffusion highlight classifier guidance and energy/log potential vs. pixel-level classifier gradients. These comparisons articulate architectural choices and learning assumptions.\n    - Reference & Attribute Guided Editing: Clear distinctions between reference-based composition (PbE’s self-supervision using bounding boxes, RIC adding sketches, PhD’s inpainting/harmonizing on a frozen model, DreamInpainter’s downsampling network features, Anydoor’s use of video frame pairs and specialized modules) versus attribute-controlled editing (FADING’s age manipulation via null-text inversion and attention control; PAIR’s per-object structure/appearance modulation; SmartBrush’s mask granularity; IIR-Net’s color/texture erasure as control). This covers differences in conditioning signals and application scenarios.\n    - Instructional Editing: The paper details InstructPix2Pix’s two-stage dataset synthesis (instruction generation via GPT-3 and editing pairs via Stable Diffusion + Prompt-to-Prompt). It then contrasts architectures (MoEController’s multi-expert design vs. FoI’s “cross-condition attention modulation”), data quality strategies (LOFIE, MagicBrush, InstructDiffusion, Emu Edit, DialogPaint, Inst-Inpaint), RLHF (HIVE), and multimodal large-model integrations (ImageBrush, InstructAny2Pix, MGIE, SmartEdit). These sections explicitly explain differences in model pipelines, data dependencies, and objectives.\n  - Testing-Time Finetuning Approaches:\n    - Denoising Model Finetuning: Distinguishes “finetuning entire denoising models” (UniTune, Custom-Edit) from “partial parameter finetuning” (KV-Inversion’s CP-attn, learning K/V in self-attention). This frames trade-offs between broad adaptation and targeted attention-layer changes for content preservation.\n    - Embedding Finetuning: Clear split between “Null-Text Embedding Finetuning” (Null-Text Inversion to align sampling trajectory for reconstruction; DPL’s leakage fixation loss) and “Text Embedding Finetuning” (DiffusionDisentanglement’s blending weights optimization; Prompt Tuning Inversion’s reconstruction/edit phases via interpolation). Differences in objective (reconstruction fidelity vs. edit alignment) are explicit.\n    - Latent Variable Optimization: Compares human-guided drag methods (DragonDiffusion energy function; DragDiffusion optimizing latents at a specific time step) to guidance using CLIP features (DDS, DiffuseIT, CDS), making architectural and optimization contrasts concrete.\n    - Hybrid Finetuning: Imagic, LayerDiffusion, Forgedit, SINE are contrasted by what gets finetuned (text embedding, denoising model, encoder/decoder) and how interpolation or layered strategies balance reconstruction with edit strength, clarifying assumptions and goals.\n  - Training & Finetuning Free Approaches:\n    - Inversion/Sampling Modification: Differentiates “reconstruction information memory” (DDPM Inversion, SDE-Drag, LEDITS++, FEC, EMILIE), “utilising null-text in sampling” (Negative Inversion, ProxEdit, Null-Text Guidance), and “single-step multiple noise prediction” (EDICT, AIDI). This dissects reconstruction strategies and sampling assumptions in detail.\n    - Attention Modification: Offers precise contrasts—P2P’s cross-attention map replacement vs. Pix2Pix-Zero’s text-free editing; MasaCtrl’s K/V replacement vs. PnP’s Q/K manipulation; local attention map modification (TF-ICON, Object-Shape Variation); attention score guidance (Conditional Score Guidance vs. EBMs). This reflects deep architectural comparisons of attention control.\n    - Mask Guidance: Structures approaches by efficiency (FISEdit, Blended Latent Diffusion, PFB-Diff), auto-generation (DiffEdit, RDM, MFL), and regional focus (Differential Diffusion, Watch Your Steps), with clear distinctions in objectives and workflows.\n  - Inpainting/Outpainting:\n    - Traditional vs. multimodal conditional pipelines, supervised vs. zero-shot, and techniques (context prior integration, degradation decomposition via SVD/range-null decomposition, and posterior estimation via Bayes) are contrasted, making underlying assumptions explicit.\n    - Random mask training vs. precise control conditioning (SmartBrush, Imagen Editor) vs. pretrained prior exploitation (Blended Diffusion/Latent Diffusion, Inpaint Anything, HD-Painter). This illuminates how control signals and visibility affect fidelity.\n\nWhere it falls short (why not 5/5):\n- While many contrasts are clear and technically grounded, the paper does not consistently provide a structured pros/cons analysis for each category or method. Advantages and disadvantages are mentioned selectively (e.g., “time-consuming multi-step optimization” for DiffusionCLIP addressed by EffDiff; “reconstruction failure” of DDIM inversion addressed by several methods; “limited global context visibility” in inpainting with naive masking). However, trade-offs like computational cost, robustness, reconstruction fidelity vs. edit strength, and failure modes are not uniformly tabulated or synthesized across categories.\n- Some minor inconsistencies (e.g., KV-Inversion is categorized under testing-time finetuning, yet its description notes “without the need for model finetuning”) hint at places where cross-category contrasts could be sharpened.\n\nOverall, the survey achieves a high level of clarity, rigor, and depth in comparing methods across architecture, objectives, assumptions, data dependency, learning strategy, and application scenario, supported by structured taxonomies and numerous explicit technical contrasts. It would reach 5/5 with more systematic, side-by-side pros/cons and quantified trade-offs across categories.", "Score: 4/5\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey delivers meaningful analytical interpretation across multiple method families, often grounding its categorizations in underlying mechanisms of diffusion models. However, the depth is uneven: some subsections offer strong causal reasoning and design trade-off discussion, while others remain primarily descriptive summaries.\n\nStrengths in critical analysis and technically grounded commentary:\n- Inversion and reconstruction: The paper clearly frames “reconstruction failure” as a fundamental challenge and repeatedly ties method differences to how they address this failure. In Background (“DDIM Sampling and Inversion”), it defines why accurate inversion is crucial (“Therefore, using an inversion method that ensures z0 ≈ z0 is crucial.”) and explains the DDIM inversion approximation and its weaknesses. This conceptual thread is later synthesized in “Training and Finetuning Free Approaches → Inversion/Sampling Modification,” where methods are grouped by the mechanism they use to remedy the failure:\n  - “Reconstruction Information Memory” (DDPM Inversion, SDE-Drag, LEDITS++, FEC, EMILIE) explicitly argues that storing inversion-stage information helps ensure fidelity during sampling.\n  - “Single-Step Multiple Noise Prediction” (EDICT, AIDI) is positioned as a principled alternative to DDIM inversion, with EDICT’s “mathematically exact inversion” via coupled noise vectors; this shows a mechanism-level contrast with DDIM’s local linearization.\n  - “Utilising Null-Text in Sampling” (Negative Inversion, ProxEdit, Null-Text Guidance) interprets negative prompts as a controllable degree of freedom, again relating differences to how null-text affects the sampling dynamics.\n  These sections synthesize relationships across research lines by clustering techniques according to the underlying cause (inversion fidelity) and the mechanism of control (trajectory memory, multi-noise coupling, or null-text guidance), rather than merely listing methods.\n\n- Attention mechanisms: The survey goes beyond summary by explaining how attention controls editing and differentiates methods based on which attention objects are altered.\n  - In “Attention in Stable Diffusion,” it technically describes cross-attention and self-attention roles, setting a foundation for later analysis.\n  - In “Training and Finetuning Free Approaches → Attention Modification,” it points out why Prompt-to-Prompt (P2P) works (“identifying cross-attention layers as pivotal in governing the spatial relationship between image layout and prompt words”) and contrasts feature replacement strategies: MasaCtrl “replaces the Key and Value features in the self-attention layer” with mask guidance to preserve structure, while PnP “emphasizes the Query and Key in the self-attention layer,” enabling fine-grained spatial control. This is a clear, technically grounded explanation of the fundamental causes of differing behaviors.\n\n- Mask-guided editing: The paper articulates design trade-offs and goals, separating efficiency (“Mask-Enhanced Denoising Efficiency”), automatic mask discovery (“Mask Auto-Generation”), and localized precision (“Mask-Guided Regional Focus”).\n  - FISEdit’s “cache-enabled sparse diffusion” is explicitly connected to speed and regional cache reuse; PFB-Diff’s “attention masking mechanism… to confine the impact of specific words to desired regions” shows a mechanism-level rationale for background integrity.\n  - DiffEdit and RDM are motivated as methods to automatically isolate semantically relevant regions, reducing unintended changes—again tying a design choice (auto masks) to a failure mode (prompt-irrelevant edits).\n\n- Test-time finetuning mechanisms: The paper describes how changing embeddings or partial model parameters produces different outcomes.\n  - “Embedding Finetuning” connects Null-Text Inversion to the root cause (“reduce the distance between the sampling trajectory and the inversion trajectory so that the sampling process can reconstruct the original image”), and DPL’s “leakage fixation loss” is explicitly designed to mitigate cross-attention leakage—this shows thoughtful causal reasoning about attention pathologies.\n  - “Latent Variable Optimization” contrasts DragonDiffusion’s energy construction in intermediate features with DragDiffusion’s focus on a single time step, with the justification that “U-Net feature maps at a particular time step offer ample semantic and geometric information” for drag-based edits. This is an insightful observation about temporal locality and representational sufficiency.\n\n- Inpainting/outpainting analysis: The treatment of inpainting as an inverse problem is technically strong. In “Inpainting and Outpainting → Traditional Context-Driven Inpainting → Zero-Shot Learning,” the paper frames inpainting as a special linear inverse problem y = Hx + n, and then rigorously explains posterior estimation methods via Bayes’ theorem, score functions, and data-consistency projections (DPS, MCG, ΠGDM, GDP, CoPaint). This goes well beyond descriptive remarks and accurately interprets why these methods differ and what assumptions they leverage (e.g., range-null space decomposition in DDNM; spectral-space iteration in DDRM).\n\nAreas where analysis is weaker or uneven:\n- Several subsections are mostly descriptive lists without sustained causal analysis or explicit trade-off discussion. For instance:\n  - “Reference and Attribute Guided Editing” largely enumerates system components (augmentations, downsampling features, identity modules) and outcomes, with limited reflection on why certain design decisions succeed or fail across settings, or what assumptions (e.g., identity consistency vs texture variability) constrain generalization.\n  - Parts of “Instructional Editing” (e.g., “Model Architecture Enhancement,” “Data Quality Enhancement,” “Leveraging Multimodal Large-Scale Models”) focus on datasets, architectures, and training pipelines, but seldom articulate deeper comparative causes (e.g., why MOE architectures outperform single-expert baselines for certain edit types, or the failure modes and bias introduced by synthetic instruction generation).\n- Trade-offs such as computational cost vs fidelity and generalization vs personalization are mentioned but not consistently unpacked. For example, “EffDiff introduces a faster method with single-step training” nods at runtime trade-offs but doesn’t fully analyze the impact on edit precision, reconstruction fidelity, or robustness. Similarly, “KV-Inversion” is placed under testing-time finetuning, while the text claims it offers editing “without the need for model finetuning,” which could confuse the reader and would benefit from clearer clarification of what is optimized (e.g., per-image attention buffers vs global weights) and the resulting trade-offs.\n- Assumptions and limitations are discussed more fully in “Challenges and Future Directions,” but within method review sections, explicit limitation analysis (e.g., failure in structural edits, spatial reasoning constraints of current T2I backbones, identity leakage in attribute-guided inpainting) is more implicit than systematic.\n\nOverall judgment:\nThe survey makes multiple substantive, technically grounded connections among methods—especially around inversion fidelity, attention manipulation, mask-guided locality, embedding vs latent optimization, and inpainting as inverse problems—demonstrating thoughtful synthesis beyond mere summary. However, the analytical depth varies: some families receive strong causal treatment, while others stay descriptive. Hence, a 4/5 score reflects meaningful critical analysis with room for deeper, more uniformly applied reasoning across all method categories.\n\nResearch guidance value:\nHigh. The mechanism-oriented taxonomies (e.g., reconstruction information memory, attention-level operations, mask roles, posterior estimation framing) and the identification of common failure modes (reconstruction, cross-attention leakage, spatial consistency) provide actionable lenses for future research. Strengthening comparative trade-off analyses and clarifying optimization scopes (global weights vs per-image variables) would further enhance guidance.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe paper’s “Challenges and Future Directions” section systematically identifies multiple, substantive research gaps and links them to concrete limitations of current diffusion-based image editing. It covers methodological, data, and evaluation dimensions, and in most cases explains why these issues matter and what their impact is. However, some items are treated somewhat briefly and could benefit from deeper causal analysis and more explicit discussion of downstream impact and research agendas, which keeps the score from a full 5.\n\nEvidence supporting the score, with specific parts and sentences:\n\n1) Methodological efficiency and deployment impact\n- Section: “Challenges and Future Directions”\n- Subsection: “Fewer-Step Model Inference”\n- Quote: “Most diffusion-based models require a significant number of steps to obtain the final image during inference, which is both time-consuming and computationally costly, bringing challenges in model deployment and user experience.”\n- Assessment: The gap is clearly motivated (time and cost), tied to practical impact (deployment, UX), and potential directions are outlined (few-step/one-step generation, distillation, consistency models). The analysis is solid but concise; it does not deeply explore trade-offs (e.g., quality–speed, stability at few steps) or specific benchmarks to measure success.\n\n2) Training cost and data efficiency\n- Subsection: “Efficient Models”\n- Quote: “Training a diffusion model that can generate realistic results is computationally intensive and requires a large amount of high-quality data.”\n- Impact/context: The authors identify model efficiency as a core gap and suggest directions (architectural efficiency, partial-parameter training, LoRA), which links methods to data/compute constraints. This is important for broad adoption, but the discussion is relatively brief and could more fully analyze data curation bottlenecks, domain-specific scarcity, or trade-offs between freezing vs. fine-tuning.\n\n3) Structural fidelity and complex object editing\n- Subsection: “Complex Object Structure Editing”\n- Quote: “they still produce noticeable artifacts when dealing with complex structures, such as fingers, logos, and scene text.”\n- Impact/context: This gap is well-motivated (real-world artifact types), and the authors describe current mitigation attempts (negative prompting, structural guidance via layouts/edges/dense labels). This acknowledges both why it matters (visual correctness and trust) and existing remedies. The analysis is appropriate, though it could deepen by probing root causes (e.g., attention alignment limits, dataset labeling granularity) and evaluation criteria for structural correctness.\n\n4) Lighting and shadow editing\n- Subsection: “Complex Lighting and Shadow Editing”\n- Quotes: \n  - “Editing the lighting or illumination of an image remains a challenging task … aiming for realistic and consistent results.”\n  - “However, accurately editing the lighting or shadow of an object under different background conditions using diffusion models remains an unsolved problem.”\n- Impact/context: This section provides a comparatively deep analysis, surveying portrait-focused solutions, reliance on 3D priors, outdoor relighting constraints, and training-free alternatives (Retinex-based, degradation priors). It explicitly states the unsolved nature and practical importance (realism and physical plausibility). This is one of the strongest gap analyses in the section.\n\n5) Robustness and generalization\n- Subsection: “Unrobustness of Image Editing”\n- Quote: “Existing diffusion-based image editing models can synthesize realistic visual contents for a portion of given conditions. However, they still fail in many real-world scenarios.”\n- Impact/context: The authors identify a fundamental modeling gap (conditional distribution coverage), spelling out why it matters (real-world reliability) and suggesting directions (data scaling, richer conditions, iterative refinement). This connects method design to practical outcomes and is well-posed, though further discussion of failure typology, robustness to adversarial prompts, or standardized stress tests would strengthen it.\n\n6) High-resolution editing\n- Subsection: “High-Resolution Image Generation and Editing”\n- Quotes:\n  - “One of the key challenges in high-resolution image editing is ensuring precise modifications.”\n  - “Another major challenge is maintaining computational efficiency… As resolution increases, the demand for GPU memory and processing power grows substantially.”\n- Impact/context: The authors articulate why HR editing is challenging (precision, memory), and why it matters in applications. The discussion is clear but brief; it could further examine scaling strategies (tiling, patch-wise diffusion, hierarchical pipelines) and quality metrics that capture HR-specific issues.\n\n7) Evaluation metrics and benchmarks\n- Subsection: “Faithful Evaluation Metrics”\n- Quote: “most of existing works still heavily rely on user study… which is neither efficient nor scalable. Faithful quantitative evaluation metrics are still an open problem.”\n- Impact/context: This gap is well-justified and highly impactful (research progress depends on reliable metrics). The section situates current metrics (FID, KID, LPIPS, CLIP Score) and mentions newer ones (DreamSim, FFA), while the paper elsewhere introduces LMM Score and demonstrates its correlation with user studies (see “Benchmark and Evaluation” -> “LMM Score vs. Other Metrics” and “Correlation Between LMM Score and User Study”). This is a strong identification of an evaluation gap and partial remedy.\n\nAdditional support beyond the Challenges section:\n- In “Benchmark and Evaluation” -> “Benchmark Construction,” the paper explicitly identifies a gap in existing benchmarks:\n  - Quote: “existing benchmarks for image editing are limited and do not fully meet the needs identified in our survey.”\n  - They propose EditEval and LMM Score, and empirically compare it to other metrics, strengthening the evaluation gap analysis with concrete contributions.\n\nWhy not a full 5:\n- While the coverage is broad and touches data (training cost, data scarcity), methods (efficiency, structural control, lighting/shadow modeling), and evaluation (metrics, benchmarks), several subsections are somewhat brief and do not deeply unpack root causes, trade-offs, or concrete research agendas for each gap (e.g., standardized protocols for structural evaluation, domain-specific data governance, safety/ethics/misuse and editing provenance/watermarking considerations are not discussed). The analysis is strong overall but uneven in depth across items.\n\nOverall, the section identifies key gaps with clear relevance and provides useful directional guidance, earning a solid 4 out of 5.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe “Challenges and Future Directions” section identifies several forward-looking research directions grounded in clear gaps and real-world needs, but the analysis of their potential impact and innovation is relatively brief and lacks deeply articulated, actionable research roadmaps—hence a score of 4 rather than 5.\n\nEvidence from specific parts of the paper:\n- Efficiency and deployment needs are explicitly tied to real-world constraints:\n  - Fewer-Step Model Inference: “Most diffusion-based models require a significant number of steps to obtain the final image during inference, which is both time-consuming and computationally costly, bringing challenges in model deployment and user experience.” The authors propose concrete directions such as “few-step or one-step generation diffusion models,” knowledge distillation, and notably “develop few-step models directly without relying on the pretrained models, such as consistency models” (Challenges and Future Directions, Fewer-Step Model Inference). This is forward-looking and addresses deployment and UX, though the discussion stops short of a detailed, actionable research plan.\n  - Efficient Models: “Training a diffusion model that can generate realistic results is computationally intensive and requires a large amount of high-quality data… reduce the training cost… more efficient network architectures… train only a portion of the parameters or freeze the original parameters and add a few new layers… LoRA” (Efficient Models). These suggestions are practical and aligned with real-world development constraints.\n\n- Robustness and controllability gaps are directly addressed:\n  - Complex Object Structure Editing: The paper identifies persistent artifacts with “fingers, logos, and scene text,” and suggests “use layouts, edges, or dense labels as guidance for editing the global or local structures of images” (Complex Object Structure Editing). This aligns with real-world needs but remains high-level without detailed methodology or impact analysis.\n  - Unrobustness of Image Editing: The authors articulate the core gap (“they still fail in many real-world scenarios”) and provide three concrete mitigation strategies: “scale up the data,” “adapt the model to accept more conditions such as structural guidance, 3D-aware guidance,” and “adopt iterative refinement or multi-stage training” (Unrobustness of Image Editing). These are actionable directions, though somewhat traditional and lacking deeper innovation analysis.\n\n- Lighting and shadow editing is identified as an unmet practical need with a nuanced review of current approaches:\n  - Complex Lighting and Shadow Editing: The authors survey portrait relighting, synthetic datasets, and 3D priors, then highlight the gap—“accurately editing the lighting or shadow of an object under different background conditions… remains an unsolved problem.” They point to training-free avenues such as “Retinex-Diffusion… reformulating the energy function of diffusion models based on the Retinex theory” and “ShadowDiffusion… generating visually pleasing shadows… using degradation priors.” This section is forward-looking and well-motivated by real-world relevance, but it does not articulate specific new experimental frameworks or quantify potential impact.\n\n- High-resolution editing is tied to practical constraints and technical challenges:\n  - High-Resolution Image Generation and Editing: The paper pinpoints “precise modifications… pixel-level adjustments and edge refinement” and “maintaining computational efficiency” as twin challenges. The discussion is realistic and relevant to real-world applications, but it lacks a concrete proposal for overcoming these challenges beyond acknowledging the need to balance precision and speed.\n\n- Evaluation metrics and practical assessment are explicitly connected to real-world evaluation needs:\n  - Faithful Evaluation Metrics: The paper recognizes that “faithful quantitative evaluation metrics are still an open problem” and, importantly, proposes a concrete contribution in the same paper—“we also propose an effective image editing metric LMM Score with the help of an LMM.” This is a forward-looking and practical direction that improves evaluation and aligns with real-world needs.\n\nWhy not 5 points:\n- While the section systematically maps key gaps to prospective directions and cites relevant literature, most proposals are presented at a high level. They generally lack thorough discussion of their academic and practical impact, and do not provide a clear, actionable research path (e.g., specific experimental designs, benchmarks to be created, datasets to collect, or concrete algorithmic frameworks to validate the ideas).\n- Several directions (efficiency via LoRA, scaling data, structural guidance via layouts/edges) are important but relatively conventional, with limited novelty analysis in this section.\n\nIn sum, the Future Work section is well-aligned with real-world needs and identifies multiple forward-looking directions with some specific suggestions (especially on inference efficiency, robustness, lighting/shadow editing, and metrics). However, the analysis remains brief and does not fully elaborate on impact or provide detailed, actionable research plans, fitting the 4-point description."]}
