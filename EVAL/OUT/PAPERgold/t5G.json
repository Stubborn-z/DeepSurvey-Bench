{"name": "G", "paperour": [4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4], "reason": ["Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\n- Research Objective Clarity:\n  - The paper states a clear and specific objective in the Introduction: “This paper serves as the first comprehensive survey on the evaluation of large language models.” It further operationalizes the scope with a concrete three-part framework: “As depicted in fig-main, we explore existing work in three dimensions: 1) What to evaluate, 2) Where to evaluate, and 3) How to evaluate.” This framing is reiterated and made actionable in the contributions list: “We provide a comprehensive overview of LLMs evaluations from three aspects: what to evaluate, where to evaluate, and how to evaluate… We further discuss future challenges in evaluating LLMs.” These elements collectively make the research objective explicit and well-scoped.\n  - The Introduction provides a structured rationale for the chosen focus, contrasting LLMs’ breadth of capabilities with prior task-specific models and arguing that “existing evaluation protocols may not be enough to evaluate their capabilities and potential risks.” The inclusion of the figure outlining the paper’s structure also helps clarify the direction and coverage of the survey.\n\n- Background and Motivation:\n  - The Introduction offers extensive background and motivation. It situates evaluation in the historical arc of AI (Perceptron, SVMs, deep learning) and uses the Turing Test to underscore evaluation’s role in AI progress. It provides specific, current motivations tied to LLMs: \n    - Understanding strengths and weaknesses (e.g., “PromptBench… illustrates that current LLMs are sensitive to adversarial prompts…”),\n    - Guiding human–LLM interaction,\n    - Ensuring safety and reliability in sensitive domains,\n    - Addressing the insufficiency of existing protocols for increasingly capable models.\n  - The authors also justify the need for a comprehensive survey: “Despite these efforts, a comprehensive overview capturing the entire gamut of evaluations is still lacking,” and highlight the evolving nature of LLM evaluation, which “has also presented novel aspects for evaluation.”\n  - This background is closely aligned with the paper’s objectives and shows how the survey fills a recognized gap.\n\n- Practical Significance and Guidance Value:\n  - The practical importance is clearly articulated. The Introduction emphasizes safety-critical applications (“financial institutions and healthcare facilities”) and points to broad applicability requiring reliable evaluation. It commits to actionable outcomes (e.g., “We open-source and maintain the related materials of LLMs evaluation…”) and promises synthesized guidance via the three dimensions and future challenges. \n  - The contributions further underline practical guidance: summarizing tasks and success/failure cases, cataloging benchmarks and metrics, and discussing novel protocols and grand challenges (e.g., “Designing AGI benchmarks,” “Robustness evaluation,” “Dynamic and evolving evaluation”).\n  - These elements suggest high academic and practical value by organizing the field, identifying gaps, and pointing to future research directions.\n\n- Reason for not awarding 5:\n  - The provided text does not include an Abstract section. Since the evaluation explicitly covers both Abstract and Introduction, the absence of an Abstract weakens objective clarity at the front of the paper.\n  - While the Introduction is strong, the claim “first comprehensive survey” would benefit from brief substantiation (e.g., a short comparison to prior surveys) to bolster the motivation.\n  - The objective could be further sharpened by explicitly stating research questions or inclusion/exclusion criteria for the surveyed literature in the opening section to enhance reproducibility and scope clarity.\n\nOverall, the Introduction clearly states the objective, provides robust motivation, and conveys significant practical guidance for the field, but the lack of an Abstract and minor opportunities to sharpen the objective justify a score of 4 rather than 5.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\n- Method classification clarity (relatively clear and comprehensive):\n  - The paper defines a top-level, three-axis classification of evaluation work—“what to evaluate,” “where to evaluate,” and “how to evaluate”—explicitly in the Introduction (“we explore existing work in three dimensions: 1) What to evaluate, 2) Where to evaluate, and 3) How to evaluate. Specifically, ‘what to evaluate’ encapsulates existing evaluation tasks… ‘where to evaluate’ involves selecting appropriate datasets and benchmarks… ‘how to evaluate’ is concerned with the evaluation process…”). This framing is carried through the middle sections with dedicated chapters for each axis:\n    - What to Evaluate: Sections under “What to Evaluate” subdivide the space by capability/task and by application domain: NLP tasks (NLU, Reasoning, NLG, Multilingual, Factuality), Robustness/Ethics/Bias/Trustworthiness, Social Science, Natural Science & Engineering (with Mathematics, General science, Engineering), Medical applications, Agent applications, and Other applications. The authors acknowledge overlap (“our categorization is only one possible way”), but within each subarea they summarize representative studies and their conclusions, which makes the taxonomy operationally clear for readers.\n    - Where to Evaluate: The “Where to Evaluate: Datasets and Benchmarks” section first compiles 46 benchmarks in a large table, then organizes them into three categories—benchmarks for general tasks, specific downstream tasks, and multi-modal tasks. Each category is then described with concrete exemplars (e.g., Chatbot Arena, MT-Bench, HELM for general; APPS, MATH, TRUSTGPT, SafetyBench for specific; MME, MMBench, SEED-Bench for multimodal).\n    - How to Evaluate: The “How to Evaluate” section cleanly separates automatic vs human evaluation, summarizes key protocols (table of “new LLMs evaluation protocols”: human-in-the-loop, crowd-sourcing testing, more challenging tests), and enumerates core automatic metrics (accuracy, calibration, fairness, robustness) with formulas and examples. This is a clear, usable taxonomy of evaluation methods.\n  - Where the classification could be tighter: “What to Evaluate” mixes capability-centric categories (e.g., reasoning, factuality) with domain/application-centric categories (medical, social science), and the authors explicitly state the taxonomy is not unique. This lowers definitional neatness and makes connections across subcategories less rigorous. Nonetheless, the overall three-axis structure is coherent and consistently applied.\n\n- Evolution of methodology (partially but not fully systematic, yet shows clear trends):\n  - Historical grounding: “AI Model Evaluation” in Background reviews classical validation protocols (k-fold, holdout, LOOCV, bootstrap), then notes the shift in deep learning to static validation/test sets (e.g., ImageNet, GLUE/SuperGLUE) and argues that LLMs’ scale and opacity make “existing evaluation protocols…not enough to evaluate the true capabilities of LLMs.” This sets up a historical arc from traditional ML to DL to LLMs and motivates novel evaluation.\n  - Explicit articulation of methodological shifts: The “Summary: Benchmark and Evaluation Protocol” section synthesizes evolution explicitly as three shifts:\n    - “a shift from objective calculation to human-in-the-loop testing” (e.g., AdaVision, AdaTest);\n    - “a move from static to crowd-sourcing test sets” (DynaBench, DynaBoard, DynamicTempLAMA, DynaTask);\n    - “a shift from a unified to a challenging setting” (DeepTest, CheckList, AdaFilter; plus HELM and BIG-bench for holistic and hard-task design).\n    These statements directly address methodological evolution and link it to concrete tools and benchmarks.\n  - Forward-looking trajectory: “Grand Challenges and Opportunities” further outlines future evolution vectors—Designing AGI benchmarks, Complete behavioral evaluation, Robustness evaluation, Dynamic and evolving evaluation, Principled and trustworthy evaluation, Unified evaluation, and Beyond evaluation: LLMs enhancement. This provides a roadmap for where evaluation methodology is heading.\n  - Limitations in the evolution narrative:\n    - The evolution is presented as thematic “shifts” and future challenges rather than a detailed, chronological or phase-based progression. The paper does not deeply trace how specific evaluation practices evolved over time within each axis (e.g., from early LLM-era metrics/benchmarks to current practices) or map causal links (e.g., which model capabilities precipitated which evaluation changes).\n    - Within “What to Evaluate,” the evolution of focus (e.g., the community’s progression from core NLP benchmarks to robustness/factuality to safety) is largely implicit; the section is primarily a cross-sectional categorization with findings, not a temporal narrative.\n    - In “How to Evaluate,” while the automatic vs human taxonomy is clear and the shifts are summarized in the “Summary” section, there is limited systematic analysis of how new judging paradigms (e.g., LLM-as-a-judge) emerged, matured, and their known failure modes over time.\n\nOverall judgment:\n- The paper’s three-axis scheme is an effective and relatively clear classification that reflects the field’s breadth.\n- The evolution of methodology is explicitly acknowledged and illustrated with concrete examples and future directions, but the historical progression is not fully systematized across all axes and categories.\n- Given the clarity of the top-level framework and the useful synthesis of methodological trends, but with partial gaps in a systematic, chronological evolution and in tighter category boundaries, a score of 4 is warranted.", "Score: 4/5\n\nExplanation:\n- Diversity of datasets and metrics (strong):\n  - The survey provides broad and up-to-date coverage of benchmarks across three categories—general, specific downstream, and multi-modal—in the section “Where to Evaluate: Datasets and Benchmarks.” It explicitly states “we compile a selection of 46 popular benchmarks,” and Table “Summary of existing LLMs evaluation benchmarks” enumerates a wide set, including core general-purpose benchmarks (e.g., MMLU, BIG-bench, HELM, KoLA, Chatbot Arena, MT-Bench, OpenLLM leaderboard, AlpacaEval), robustness-oriented benchmarks (GLUE-X, BOSS, PromptBench), and extensive domain/specialized benchmarks (e.g., MATH, APPS for code, MultiMedQA, C-Eval, CMMLU, TRUSTGPT, SafetyBench, GAOKAO-Bench, M3Exam, SOCKET, API-Bank, ToolBench, FRESHQA, Dialogue CoT, CVALUES, CMB, UHGEval). For multi-modal evaluation, it covers MME, MMBench, SEED-Bench, MM-Vet, LVLM-eHub, LAMM, and notes distinctive evaluation methods (e.g., CircularEval in MMBench).\n  - The “How to Evaluate” section supplies a concise but well-structured taxonomy of metrics. The “Automatic Evaluation” subsection and the table “Key metrics of automatic evaluation” list and explain widely used metrics:\n    - Accuracy-oriented metrics: Exact Match, F1, ROUGE (with formulas for F1).\n    - Calibration: ECE and the AUC of selective accuracy vs. coverage (with definition and usage context).\n    - Fairness: Demographic Parity Difference and Equalized Odds Difference (with definitions and formulas).\n    - Robustness: Attack Success Rate and Performance Drop Rate (with formulas and clear definitions).\n  - Beyond standard metrics, the survey discusses specialized factuality and hallucination measures and frameworks in “Factuality,” including FActScore (min2023factscore), SelfCheckGPT (using BERTScore, MQAG, n-gram), and TrueTeacher; it also mentions TruthfulQA and its implications. In “Robustness,” it highlights PromptBench’s unified robustness metric (PDR) and new adversarial test suites (AdvGLUE++). In “Human Evaluation,” it provides clear rubrics (accuracy, relevance, fluency, transparency, safety, human alignment) and key design factors (number of evaluators, expertise), and references setting-specific judging methods (e.g., Chatbot Arena’s crowdsourcing and Elo, MT-Bench’s GPT-4 judgments).\n  - The survey connects metrics to use-cases: e.g., sacreBLEU is noted in the machine translation discussion; fairness metrics are tied to DecodingTrust; calibration is linked to RLHF-LMs; and robustness metrics are tied to adversarial prompt evaluations.\n\n- Rationality and applicability (generally strong, with room to improve):\n  - The paper gives a clear rationale for focusing on benchmarks rather than individual datasets: “This section will not discuss any single dataset for language models but benchmarks for LLMs,” aligning with its survey goal of covering evaluation venues and protocols across tasks.\n  - It ties metric choice to evaluation needs:\n    - It motivates human evaluation for open-ended generation where automatic metrics underperform (“Human Evaluation” explains why human assessments are preferable for open-ended and non-standard tasks).\n    - It motivates robustness and fairness metrics given deployment risks (“Robustness, Ethic, Bias, and Trustworthiness” and “Grand Challenges” underscore why these dimensions are essential).\n    - It motivates calibration metrics in the context of RLHF-LMs and reliability (“Automatic Evaluation”).\n  - It provides practical examples where metrics are applied (e.g., sacreBLEU in translation; factuality metrics and frameworks; attack-oriented metrics in robustness; Elo and win-rate in dialogue benchmarks).\n\n- Why not 5/5:\n  - While coverage breadth is excellent, per-benchmark details on dataset scale, annotation schemes, and labeling methodology are sparse. The benchmark table includes “Focus, Domain, Evaluation Criteria” but generally lacks consistent information on data sizes, splits, or labeling protocols. There are helpful exceptions (e.g., API-Bank’s “53 APIs, 264 dialogues, 568 API calls”; SEED-Bench’s “19,000 multiple-choice questions”; MINT’s SR_k definition), but most entries do not provide scale or annotation details.\n  - The “Key metrics” table omits several widely used generation metrics beyond ROUGE, such as BLEU and METEOR; BLEU appears in the narrative (sacreBLEU) but not in the metrics summary. Similarly, modern LLM judgment protocols (e.g., win rate vs. a judge LLM, Elo ratings) are discussed in context but not distilled into the metrics table. Human evaluation reliability measures (e.g., inter-annotator agreement like Krippendorff’s alpha) are not covered.\n  - Some canonical benchmarks used heavily in LLM evaluation are missing from the consolidated benchmark list (e.g., GSM8K for math reasoning, HumanEval for code, ARC/E for reasoning), though certain adjacent benchmarks (MATH, APPS, BIG-bench) are included.\n\nOverall judgment:\n- The survey offers broad, current, and well-reasoned coverage of benchmarks and metrics, articulates when and why to use particular evaluation approaches (automatic vs. human), and includes formal definitions for several key metrics. It falls short of a perfect score mainly because it does not consistently provide per-benchmark dataset scales/labeling methods and omits some standard metrics and benchmarks in the consolidated summaries.", "Score: 4/5\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey offers a clear, structured comparison of evaluation methods and benchmarks along several meaningful dimensions, but parts of the coverage remain high-level or list-like, and the paper does not consistently analyze differences in terms of architectures, objectives, or assumptions across all methods.\n\nWhat works well (evidence of systematic, comparative treatment):\n- Clear two-way comparison of evaluation paradigms (How to Evaluate):\n  - Automatic vs. human evaluation is explicitly contrasted in scope, suitability, and trade-offs. In “Automatic Evaluation,” the paper states that automated evaluation “saves time” and “reduces the impact of human subjective factors,” and then enumerates concrete metric families (accuracy, calibration, fairness, robustness) with formulas (ECE, AUC, DPD, EOD, ASR, PDR). In “Human Evaluation,” it argues automatic metrics are insufficient “in open-generation tasks… where embedded similarity metrics… are not enough,” and details when human judgment is more reliable, noting variance risks (“high variance and instability… due to cultural and individual differences”). It also provides structured rubrics (accuracy, relevance, fluency, transparency, safety, human alignment) and evaluator considerations (number of evaluators, expertise), which clearly defines distinctions and use-cases between the two methods.\n- Methodological shifts and their implications (Summary → Benchmark and Evaluation Protocol):\n  - The paper explicitly contrasts three evaluation “shifts”:\n    - From objective calculation to “human-in-the-loop” testing (AdaVision, AdaTest), emphasizing the benefit of interactive, error-surface discovery (“helps users identify and fix coherent failure modes”).\n    - From static to crowd-sourcing/dynamic test sets (DynaBench, DynaBoard, DynamicTempLAMA), highlighting advantages for distributional shift and robustness testing.\n    - From unified to challenging settings (DeepTest, CheckList, AdaFilter), noting limitations (e.g., “AdaFilter may not be entirely fair as it relies on adversarial examples”). This gives a pros/cons framing rather than mere listing.\n- Benchmark-level comparisons that articulate differing objectives and assumptions (Where to Evaluate):\n  - “Benchmarks for General Tasks” contrasts Chatbot Arena and MT-Bench by design philosophy: Arena’s user-facing pairwise preference and Elo-based ranking vs. MT-Bench’s curated multi-turn dialogue questions and more controlled multi-turn capability assessment. It explicitly notes MT-Bench’s ability to “simulate dialogue scenarios representative of real-world settings” and to “overcome limitations in traditional evaluation approaches,” while positioning HELM as a “holistic” multi-metric assessment framework, and KoLA as knowledge-oriented inference evaluation. It further contrasts OOD/adversarial robustness benchmarks (GLUE-X, BOSS, PromptBench) with fine-tuning/evaluator approaches (PandaLM), clarifying different evaluation goals and assumptions (robustness vs. prompt sensitivity vs. subjective qualities like “conciseness, clarity, adherence to instructions”).\n  - “Benchmarks for Specific Downstream Tasks” differentiates domain-specific objectives (e.g., SafetyBench for security, TRUSTGPT for ethics and value-alignment, CELLO for complex instruction following, MultiMedQA for medical QA, API-Bank/ToolBench for tool use) and identifies target capabilities and criteria, which helps readers see commonalities (all task-focused) and distinctions (safety vs. reasoning vs. tool-use).\n- Comparative framing of robustness/ethics/trustworthiness methods (Robustness, Ethics and Bias, Trustworthiness):\n  - The robustness section distinguishes OOD robustness, adversarial robustness, and domain-specific robustness (vision-language vulnerability), citing different datasets (AdvGLUE, ANLI, GLUE-X, PromptBench) and pointing out a general vulnerability to adversarial prompts (showing a clear cross-method takeaway). The ethics section contrasts toxic/bias measurement approaches (BOLD, RealToxicityPrompts, BBQ), and the trustworthiness section synthesizes multiple axes (toxicity, bias, robustness, privacy, machine ethics, fairness) from DecodingTrust, explicitly noting a nuanced finding: “GPT-4… more susceptible to attacks” despite improved scores—an example of advantage/disadvantage analysis across models and dimensions.\n\nWhere the comparison falls short (why not 5/5):\n- In “What to Evaluate,” much of the discussion reads as a sequence of results across tasks (NLU, Reasoning, NLG, Multilingual, Factuality) rather than a fully systematized comparison of methodological choices (e.g., prompt regimes, few-shot vs. zero-shot, evaluation setups, dataset assumptions) across works. For instance, the sentiment/NLI/semantics subsections mostly report model-level findings (e.g., “ChatGPT outperforms GPT-3.5 for NLI tasks” vs. “LLMs perform poorly in representing human disagreement”) without framing these differences along consistent methodological dimensions (training regimes, inference strategies like CoT vs. no-CoT, supervision levels), or explicitly articulating differing assumptions behind the studies.\n- The metric subsection (Automatic Evaluation) defines and exemplifies metrics but does not analyze trade-offs or selection criteria across metrics (e.g., when EM vs F1 vs ROUGE is appropriate, or calibration metric sensitivities), which would elevate the rigor of the comparison.\n- “Benchmarks for Specific Downstream Tasks” provides detailed descriptions but less cross-benchmark synthesis (e.g., a unifying matrix of evaluation dimensions such as supervision needs, dynamic vs static data, adversarial content, human-in-the-loop requirements, or reliance on external tools). The distinctions are present but not consistently mapped onto a multi-dimensional comparative framework.\n- The survey rarely analyzes differences in architectures or training objectives of the evaluated systems (e.g., how RLHF vs. purely pre-trained LMs change evaluation behavior, or how chain-of-thought prompting vs. standard prompting impacts benchmark alignment) beyond scattered references. The “How to Evaluate” section does better here, but it is not carried through across all sections.\n\nOverall, the paper systematically contrasts evaluation paradigms, benchmarks, and trustworthiness angles and identifies advantages, disadvantages, and differences in goals and assumptions in several key places (notably “How to Evaluate” and “Where to Evaluate” and the method-shift discussion). However, several sections (especially “What to Evaluate”) remain more descriptive and list-like, and cross-method comparisons could be more rigorously organized by explicit dimensions (e.g., data dependence, prompting strategy, supervision level, dynamic vs static settings, human involvement, and evaluation criteria). Hence, a 4/5 is warranted.", "Score: 3/5\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey provides a broad and well-organized synthesis of tasks, benchmarks, and evaluation protocols (“what/where/how”), but its critical analysis of methodological differences is relatively shallow and uneven. It offers occasional interpretive comments and high-level reflections, yet rarely explains the fundamental causes behind method/model differences, the design trade-offs and assumptions of competing approaches, or a tightly reasoned synthesis across research lines.\n\nEvidence supporting the score:\n\n1) Mostly descriptive summaries with limited causal analysis\n- In most subsections under “What to Evaluate,” the paper catalogs results by task (e.g., NLP understanding, reasoning, NLG, multilingual, factuality) and cites performance trends, but seldom probes underlying mechanisms. Example patterns:\n  - Sentiment analysis: “In conclusion, LLMs have demonstrated commendable performance… Future work should focus on enhancing their capability to understand emotions in under-resourced languages.” This identifies a gap but does not analyze why these gaps arise (e.g., training data distribution, tokenization effects, morphology) or trade-offs between zero-shot prompting vs fine-tuning.\n  - Translation: “ChatGPT performs X → Eng translation well, but it still lacks the ability to perform Eng → X translation.” No mechanistic discussion of data asymmetry, domain shift, tokenizer coverage, or decoding biases driving this directional discrepancy.\n  - Multilingual: “LLMs perform poorly when it came to non-Latin languages and languages with limited resources.” The observation is correct, but the paper does not unpack causes (e.g., corpus imbalance, script segmentation issues, pretraining objectives, RLHF focus on English) or contrast different mitigation designs (e.g., adapters, vocabulary augmentation, task-specific finetuning).\n\n2) Some interpretive comments exist, but they are brief or speculative\n- Reasoning section: “This is because ChatGPT is designed explicitly for chatting, so it does an excellent job of maintaining rationality.” This is a plausible but unsubstantiated attribution; it does not systematically relate RLHF objectives, decoding strategies, or prompt formats to logical reasoning performance. Similarly, remarks like “ChatGPT is prone to uncertain responses, leading to poor performance” (on symbolic reasoning) are speculative without a deeper analysis of alignment constraints, calibration, or refusal behavior.\n- Factuality: The survey notes methodological gaps reported by others (“highlighted the absence of a unified comparison framework… transformed existing fact consistency tasks into binary labels”), and lists various approaches (e.g., NLI-based, QG-based, SelfCheckGPT, FActScore). However, it stops short of comparing their assumptions (e.g., entailment transfer limits, sensitivity to paraphrase, dependency on external retrieval), failure modes, or the trade-offs between black-box vs white-box settings and evaluator reliability.\n\n3) Limited synthesis across research lines and methods\n- Robustness: The paper names OOD, adversarial robustness, and dataset bias, referencing an attempt by Li et al. to unify these lines. Yet, the survey itself does not provide a framework explaining how these robustness notions interrelate (e.g., distribution shift taxonomies, attacker knowledge levels, threat models), their conflicting evaluation setups, or how design choices (prompting templates, defense strategies) trade off task performance and safety.\n- Human vs automatic evaluation: The “How to Evaluate” section outlines metrics and provides a rubric for human assessment (accuracy, relevance, fluency, transparency, safety, human alignment) and briefly acknowledges variance (“even human evaluations can have high variance”). It lacks deeper treatment of method-level trade-offs—e.g., limitations and biases of LLM-as-judge vs human raters, reliability/validity discussions, contamination risks in automatic metrics, or calibration of LLM judges. Equations for metrics are provided, but critique of their suitability and failure cases across tasks is minimal.\n\n4) Strengths: some reflective insights and forward-looking commentary\n- The “Grand Challenges” section goes beyond listing to articulate meaningful, field-level needs: dynamic and evolving evaluation (addresses contamination and temporal drift), principled and trustworthy evaluation (questioning validity of evaluation itself), and “beyond evaluation” (closing the loop from diagnosis to enhancement). These are valuable interpretive positions that frame future work. However, they are high-level and do not deeply analyze method trade-offs (e.g., secrecy vs reproducibility in dynamic benchmarks, the statistical properties needed for principled evaluations, or concrete validation protocols for “trustworthy evaluation”).\n- Occasional mechanistic notes appear in domain sections (e.g., math: “The primary reasons behind GPT-4’s low performance in these tasks are errors in algebraic manipulation and difficulties in retrieving pertinent domain-specific concepts,” engineering/code: differences across algorithmic categories). These are useful but scattered and not developed into a broader synthesis about why certain architectural choices or training regimes produce systematic error profiles.\n\n5) Uneven depth across sections\n- “Where to Evaluate” is largely an enumerative catalog of benchmarks, occasionally noting distinctive design features (e.g., Chatbot Arena’s Elo, MT-Bench’s multi-turn design, HELM’s holistic multi-metric focus, GLUE-X/BOSS for OOD, PromptBench for adversarial prompts, PandaLM as a judge). It does not deeply examine trade-offs (e.g., model-judge circularity, robustness vs coverage, crowd-sourcing biases, leakage risks), nor does it integrate these into a cohesive evaluation framework.\n- “What to Evaluate” and “How to Evaluate” contain some interpretive statements (e.g., when human evaluation is necessary; safety and toxicity concerns; adversarial vulnerabilities), but most of the content remains descriptive.\n\nOverall judgment:\n- The paper excels at breadth and organization and includes high-level reflections and future directions. However, as a critical analysis of methods, it leans toward summarization rather than sustained, technically grounded causal reasoning about why methods differ, what assumptions and trade-offs they embody, and how disparate research lines connect. Hence, a score of 3/5 reflects that it provides basic analytical comments and some interpretive insight, but the depth and mechanistic reasoning expected for a top-tier critical review are limited.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe paper’s “Grand Challenges and Opportunities for Future Research” section identifies a broad and relevant set of research gaps and articulates why they matter, but most analyses remain high-level and stop short of deeper methodological, data, and operational detail that would merit a 5.\n\nWhere the section succeeds (breadth and clear importance/impact):\n- Comprehensive coverage of gaps across multiple dimensions:\n  - Methods/protocols and scope:\n    • Designing AGI Benchmarks: The authors explicitly flag the open problem of what truly measures AGI and pose foundational questions (e.g., “does it make sense to use human values as a starting point for test construction, or should alternative perspectives be considered?”). This frames a core methodological gap around construct validity for AGI evaluation.\n    • Complete Behavioral Evaluation: They argue for open-environment, behavioral testing (“construct evaluations on a robot manipulated by LLMs… multi-modal dimensions”), highlighting the limits of static, task-only benchmarks.\n    • Robustness Evaluation: They emphasize real-world brittleness and prompt sensitivity (“current LLMs are not robust to the inputs”) and call for richer, more diverse and efficient robustness evaluations, tying robustness to everyday deployment (“extensive integration into daily life”).\n    • Dynamic and Evolving Evaluation: They diagnose a key data-centric gap—static, public benchmarks enable memorization and “training data contamination”—and argue for dynamic/evolving benchmarks to ensure fair, up-to-date assessment (“developing dynamic and evolving evaluation systems is the key to providing a fair evaluation of LLMs”).\n    • Principled and Trustworthy Evaluation: They identify the meta-evaluation gap (“ascertain [evaluation system] integrity and trustworthiness… intertwines with measurement theory”), raising the crucial issue of validating that purported OOD tests are truly OOD (“how can we ensure that dynamic testing truly generates out-of-distribution examples?”).\n    • Unified Evaluation that Supports All LLM Tasks: They call for evaluation systems spanning value alignment, safety, verification, fine-tuning, etc., noting current fragmentation and citing PandaLM as a step toward this.\n    • Beyond Evaluation: LLMs Enhancement: They argue evaluation should produce diagnostic analyses that inform improvement, using PromptBench’s analyses (attention and word-frequency) as an example of how evaluation can guide robustness enhancement.\n\n- Clear articulation of why the gaps matter (impact):\n  - Dynamic benchmarks address fairness and contamination (“likely to be memorized… potential training data contamination”).\n  - Robustness evaluation is tied to user-facing reliability (“crucial… given their extensive integration into daily life”).\n  - Principled evaluation underscores risks of misleading conclusions without validated measurement.\n  - Behavioral testing highlights the mismatch between current benchmarks and embodied/multi-modal real-world use.\n  - Unified evaluations are needed to keep pace with the expanding task surface of LLMs (alignment, safety, tools).\n\nWhere the section falls short (depth and operational detail):\n- Analyses are brief and largely conceptual. Most subsections consist of one paragraph outlining the problem and a general direction, with limited guidance on concrete methods, data strategies, or metrics. For example:\n  - Designing AGI Benchmarks frames profound questions but does not propose operational criteria, psychometric constructs, or cross-disciplinary design patterns for AGI tests.\n  - Dynamic and Evolving Evaluation identifies contamination and staleness but does not discuss practical mechanisms (e.g., sequestered private test servers, time-split evaluations, streaming/continual benchmarks, evaluation secrecy, or anti-data-leak protocols).\n  - Robustness Evaluation highlights needs (more diverse sets, evolving definitions) but does not delve into attack taxonomies, coverage measurement, trade-offs between strength and feasibility, or standardized robustness scoring.\n  - Principled and Trustworthy Evaluation raises the meta-issue but lacks concrete approaches from measurement theory (e.g., validity/reliability frameworks, rater agreement protocols for human evals, formal OOD detection criteria, test construction validity checks).\n  - Unified Evaluation does not specify how to align heterogeneous task metrics or how to reconcile subjective and objective criteria across alignment, safety, code, multi-modal, and agentic tasks.\n- Data dimension coverage is present but not deeply analyzed. While the authors diagnose static/public benchmark limitations and memorization, they do not explore multilingual/low-resource data gaps, annotation quality controls, evaluator variance controls, or mechanisms for continual data refresh beyond high-level statements.\n- The section does not prioritize gaps, discuss feasibility, or assess expected impact quantitatively (e.g., how contamination biases scores, or robustness failures translate to downstream risk).\n\nCited locations supporting this assessment:\n- Dynamic and Evolving Evaluation: “Existing evaluation protocols… rely on static and public benchmarks… The capabilities of LLMs may enhance over time which cannot be consistently evaluated… [benchmarks] likely to be memorized… resulting in potential training data contamination. Therefore, developing dynamic and evolving evaluation systems is the key to providing a fair evaluation of LLMs.”\n- Robustness Evaluation: “it is crucial for LLMs to maintain robustness… the same prompts but with different grammars and expressions could lead… diverse results… there are much room for advancement, such as including more diverse evaluation sets… more evaluation aspects… developing more efficient evaluations… the concept and definition of robustness are constantly evolving.”\n- Principled and Trustworthy Evaluation: “it is crucial to ascertain [an evaluation system’s] integrity and trustworthiness… intertwines with measurement theory… how can we ensure that dynamic testing truly generates out-of-distribution examples? There is a scarcity of research in this domain…”\n- Designing AGI Benchmarks: “which [tasks] can truly measure AGI capabilities… utilize cross-disciplinary knowledge… unresolved issues… should [we] use human values as a starting point…?”\n- Complete Behavioral Evaluation: “An ideal AGI evaluation should contain… complete behavioral tests… construct evaluations on a robot… multi-modal dimensions.”\n- Unified Evaluation that Supports All LLM Tasks: “we need to develop evaluation systems that can support all kinds of tasks such as value alignment, safety, verification, interdisciplinary research, fine-tuning…”\n- Beyond Evaluation: LLMs Enhancement: “evaluation is not the end goal… should also deliver… analysis, recommendations, and guidance… PromptBench… provides… attention visualization… word frequency analysis… providing prompt engineering guidance…”\n\nOverall, the section identifies the major gaps across evaluation scope, protocol design, data staleness/contamination, meta-evaluation, and translation to improvement, and it explains their importance. However, the discussion remains largely programmatic and lacks deeper methodological detail and concrete pathways, aligning best with a score of 4.", "Score: 4/5\n\nExplanation:\nThe paper’s “Grand Challenges and Opportunities for Future Research” section clearly identifies multiple forward-looking research directions grounded in recognized gaps and real-world needs, but most directions are articulated at a high level with limited operational detail, which prevents it from reaching a top score.\n\nStrengths that justify 4/5:\n- Ties to real-world needs and concrete gaps:\n  - Dynamic and Evolving Evaluation: The paper explicitly problematizes static public benchmarks (“static and public benchmarks are likely to be memorized by LLMs, resulting in potential training data contamination”), and calls for “developing dynamic and evolving evaluation systems.” This directly addresses a pressing, real-world evaluation failure mode (data contamination and non-stationarity in deployed models).\n  - Robustness Evaluation: It connects a pervasive user-facing issue to research needs (“the same prompts but with different grammars and expressions could lead… diverse results”) and recommends “more diverse evaluation sets, examining more evaluation aspects, and developing more efficient evaluations… [and] updating the evaluation system to better align with emerging requirements related to ethics and bias.” This is both forward-looking and grounded in practical failures seen by end users.\n  - Principled and Trustworthy Evaluation: The section argues for “trustworthy evaluation systems,” linking evaluation integrity to “measurement theory” and raises concrete meta-evaluation questions (“how can we ensure that dynamic testing truly generates out-of-distribution examples?”), reflecting real concerns about evaluation validity and reproducibility.\n  - Unified Evaluation that Supports All LLMs Tasks: It identifies the need for evaluation that spans “value alignment, safety, verification, interdisciplinary research, fine-tuning,” noting a current fragmentation in practice. This responds to the real-world need to compare and validate systems consistently across operationally critical dimensions (e.g., safety).\n  - Beyond Evaluation: LLMs Enhancement: The paper proposes that evaluations should produce “insightful analysis, recommendations, and guidance,” and gives specific examples (e.g., in PromptBench, “attention visualization… word frequency analysis to identify robust and non-robust words” and subsequent enhancements to long-tailed LVLM tasks). This offers a concrete bridge from assessment to improvement with potential practical impact.\n\n- Introduces new or distinctive research topics:\n  - Evaluation as a new discipline: The paper frames evaluation itself as a primary research field (“evaluation should be treated as an essential discipline”), which is an insightful meta-level reframing that can influence how future work is organized.\n  - Designing AGI Benchmarks: It highlights difficult open questions (e.g., whether to base AGI tests on “human values” and the need to draw on “education, psychology, and social sciences”), carving out an interdisciplinary research agenda.\n  - Complete Behavioral Evaluation: It suggests “behavioral tests” in open environments (e.g., “LLMs as the central controller… construct evaluations on a robot”), which, while ambitious, is a concrete and forward-looking topic.\n\nWhy not 5/5:\n- Limited actionability and depth in several directions:\n  - Designing AGI Benchmarks: While it surfaces important questions, it does not provide a concrete blueprint (e.g., task taxonomies, psychometric design principles, measurement protocols, or validation plans) for constructing such benchmarks.\n  - Dynamic and Evolving Evaluation: It identifies the need but does not outline mechanisms (e.g., continual-benchmark refresh pipelines, blind evaluation servers, contamination detection protocols, dataset governance models).\n  - Principled and Trustworthy Evaluation: It raises meta-evaluation issues but lacks specific methodological proposals (e.g., statistical tests for OOD-ness, audit trails, calibration of judges, or formal validity frameworks).\n  - Unified Evaluation: It names focal areas (alignment, safety, verification) and cites PandaLM as an example, but does not present an architecture, shared schema, or integration protocol that would make the proposal immediately actionable.\n- Analysis of academic and practical impact is often brief:\n  - Most subsections articulate the “what” but only partially address the “so what” (e.g., expected gains for deployment, standardization pathways, or how proposed directions would change model selection and governance in high-stakes domains).\n\nSpecific parts supporting the score:\n- Section “Grand Challenges and Opportunities for Future Research”\n  - “Evaluation as a new discipline… evaluation should be treated as an essential discipline…” (forward-looking meta-framing).\n  - “Designing AGI Benchmarks… utilize cross-disciplinary knowledge… unresolved issues… does it make sense to use human values…” (identifies a gap; limited actionable detail).\n  - “Complete Behavioral Evaluation… construct evaluations on a robot manipulated by LLMs… multi-modal dimensions should also be considered” (concrete research topic aligned with real-world embodied applications).\n  - “Robustness Evaluation… same prompts but with different grammars… more diverse evaluation sets… updating the evaluation system to better align with emerging requirements related to ethics and bias” (clear gap-to-direction linkage with practical relevance).\n  - “Dynamic and Evolving Evaluation… static and public benchmarks… likely to be memorized… developing dynamic and evolving evaluation systems” (responds to contamination and capability drift).\n  - “Principled and Trustworthy Evaluation… ensure its integrity and trustworthiness… intertwines with measurement theory… how can we ensure that dynamic testing truly generates out-of-distribution examples?” (important, underexplored area).\n  - “Unified Evaluation that Supports All LLMs Tasks… value alignment, safety, verification… more general evaluation systems” (identifies fragmentation and proposes consolidation).\n  - “Beyond Evaluation: LLMs Enhancement… evaluation should… deliver… analysis, recommendations… PromptBench… attention visualization… word frequency analysis… enhancement after evaluation” (offers specific, impactful examples that translate evaluation insights into improvements).\n\nOverall, the section proposes several timely, pertinent, and in parts innovative directions that align well with observed gaps and practical needs. The primary shortfall is the lack of detailed, actionable roadmaps and deeper impact analyses for most directions."]}
