Therefore, the research objective is not stated in the Abstract and cannot be verified there, which prevents full credit under the stated requirement to assess the Abstract and Introduction.\n\n- Explicit objectives in the Introduction (Section 1.4: Motivation and Scope of the Survey)\n  - The paper states its objectives explicitly and precisely:\n    - “This survey has three primary objectives, each aligned with the structured progression outlined in the following subsection. First, it seeks to provide a systematic taxonomy of LLM-based agents, categorizing them by architecture, capabilities, and applications.” (Section 1.4)\n    - “Second, the survey critically analyzes the limitations and challenges of LLM-based agents.” (Section 1.4)\n    - “Third, the survey identifies emerging trends and future directions.” (Section 1.4)\n  - The objectives are clearly linked to core field problems and gaps:\n    - “This fragmentation underscores the necessity of a comprehensive survey that synthesizes disparate research threads into a cohesive narrative—a goal this survey aims to achieve by bridging foundational concepts, real-world applications, and future directions.” (Section 1.4, The Need for a Comprehensive Survey)\n    - “Moreover, the field lacks standardized evaluation methodologies and benchmarks… This survey addresses this gap by reviewing existing benchmarks and proposing a unified evaluation paradigm, as further elaborated in Section 8: Evaluation and Benchmarking.” (Section 1.4)\n  - The motivation is explicitly articulated:\n    - “This survey is motivated by the urgent need to consolidate the fragmented research landscape, address critical knowledge gaps, and provide a structured framework for future developments in LLM-based agents…” (Section 1.4)\n  - The scope is explicitly bounded:\n    - “This survey focuses on LLM-based agents as autonomous entities capable of reasoning, planning, and interacting with environments. It excludes non-LLM-based agents… and narrows its scope to post-2020 advancements…” (Section 1.4, Scope and Boundaries)\n\n- Supporting structure in the Introduction (Section 1.5: Structure of the Survey)\n  - The paper reinforces and operationalizes the objectives by outlining how the survey will address them across sections:\n    - “This survey is systematically organized to provide a comprehensive exploration of large language model (LLM)-based agents…” (Section 1.5)\n\nReason for not awarding 5\n- While the Introduction states the objectives with high precision and connects them to well-explained background and motivation, the Abstract is not present in the provided text; thus, the objective is not stated in the Abstract as required for full score under the evaluation brief.", "5\n\nClassification evidence:\n- Section 2.1: “Broadly, LLM-based agents can be categorized into modular, hierarchical, and hybrid architectures…”\n- Section 2.2: “Below, we analyze the prominent training techniques, including supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and self-supervised learning…”\n- Section 2.6: “This section examines key memory architectures—episodic, working, and hybrid systems…”\n- Section 6.1: “Three core issues—hallucination, inconsistency, and knowledge gaps—are particularly critical…”\n- Section 7.2 (Parameter-efficient FT): “LoRA… QLoRA… Adapter Layers and Prefix Tuning…”\n- Sections 3.x offer a systematic architectural taxonomy by type: 3.1 (Modular), 3.2 (Hierarchical and Self-Organizing), 3.3 (Multimodal and Context-Aware), 3.4 (Retrieval-Augmented and Memory-Enhanced), 3.5 (Multi-Agent Collaboration), 3.6 (Human-AI Interaction and Real-Time Execution).\n\nEvolution/development evidence:\n- Section 2.6 → 2.7 bridge: “Memory mechanisms serve as a critical bridge between the limitations of LLM-based agents (Section 2.5) and their potential… through cognitive architectures (Section 2.7).”\n- Section 2.7: “Building upon the memory mechanisms discussed in Section 2.6, … cognitive and hybrid architectures further enhance agent capabilities…”\n- Section 3.2: “Building upon the modular architectures discussed in Section 3.1, hierarchical and self-organizing frameworks represent advanced paradigms… setting the stage for the multimodal extensions covered in Section 3.3.”\n- Section 3.3: “Building on hierarchical and self-organizing architectures (Section 3.2)… laying the groundwork for the retrieval-augmented and memory-enhanced agents discussed in Section 3.4.”\n- Section 3.4: “Building on the multimodal and context-aware frameworks discussed in Section 3.3, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)… paving the way for the collaborative and communicative multi-agent systems discussed in Section 3.5.”\n- Section 3.5: “Building upon the retrieval-augmented and memory-enhanced architectures discussed in Section 3.4… further extended in real-time human-AI interaction systems (Section 3.6).”\n- Section 3.6: “Building upon the multi-agent collaboration frameworks discussed in Section 3.5, the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into real-time human-AI interaction systems…”\n- Section 7.2: “Building upon the knowledge-grounded approaches of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Section 7.1), fine-tuning strategies provide another critical pathway…”\n- Section 7.3: “Building upon the parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies discussed in Section 7.2, Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approaches…”\n- Section 7.4: “Building on the human-AI collaboration frameworks discussed in Section 7.3, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) extends these principles…”\n- Section 7.5: “Hybrid architectures… positioning them as a bridge between the multi-agent collaboration frameworks discussed in Section 7.4 and the self-improving systems explored in Section 7.6.”\n- Section 7.6: “Building on the hybrid architectures discussed in Section 7.5, self-improving and meta-cognitive systems represent the next evolutionary step…”", "Score: 4/5\n\nEvidence (with quotes):\n- Multiple datasets/benchmarks named with scenarios and some scale:\n  - Coding/software interaction: “The AndroidArena benchmark [95] tests agents in a dynamic operating system environment, requiring cross-application cooperation and adherence to user constraints (e.g., security, preferences).” \n  - Competitive programming: “Similarly, PPTC-R evaluates agents in competitive programming scenarios, measuring code correctness, efficiency, and edge-case handling.”\n  - Robotics/embodied AI (with scale): “LIBERO [199] evaluates lifelong learning across 130 manipulation tasks, emphasizing knowledge transfer in dynamic environments.”\n  - Robotics task grounding: “VoxPoser [45] tests agents’ capacity to translate natural language instructions into precise robotic actions via 3D value maps.”\n  - Healthcare simulations: “The AI-SCI framework [31] simulates high-fidelity patient interactions, revealing that static benchmarks fail to capture the unpredictability of real clinical workflows.”\n  - Finance/business: “Financial benchmarks like FinGPT [42] test agents on real-time market data analysis… FinMem [5] further highlights the gap between supervised and zero-shot performance in sentiment analysis.”\n  - Multi-agent/social: “benchmarks like AgentVerse [59] evaluate collaboration and competition… CompeteAI [86] reveals suboptimal economic decision-making compared to humans.”\n  - Dynamic/robustness: “NPHardEval rigorously tests agents on NP-hard problems, evaluating their capacity to handle computationally complex and dynamically changing scenarios [220].” and “AgentSims provides a simulated multi-agent environment where LLM agents collaborate or compete under time constraints.”\n\n- Broad coverage of evaluation methodologies with justification for use:\n  - Task-specific evaluation: “Task-specific evaluations measure LLM agents' performance in specialized domains using curated benchmarks designed to test accuracy, fluency, and task completion.” and “These benchmarks provide granular insights into domain proficiency.”\n  - Human-centric evaluation: “Human-centric methodologies prioritize qualitative assessments by human judges, focusing on coherence, interpretability, and alignment with human values.”\n  - Automated evaluation: “Automated techniques enable scalable assessments… analyzing response variance using metrics like BLEU and BERTScore.” and “Dynamic testing frameworks… simulate real-world interactions to evaluate adaptability.”\n\n- Metrics are explicitly categorized and linked to scenarios:\n  - Core metrics: “Accuracy remains a cornerstone metric… precision (correctness of selected actions) and recall (completeness…).”\n  - Task success/robustness: “Task success rate measures the proportion of tasks completed successfully, often paired with efficiency (time/steps) and robustness (performance under perturbations).”\n  - Human preference/alignment: “Human preference scores assess usability, likability, and trustworthiness… often rely on Likert-scale surveys or pairwise comparisons.”\n  - Domain-specific metrics: “Security: [26] introduces vulnerability exploitation rates to quantify risks… Economics: [48] measures decision realism and emergent macroeconomic phenomena… Multi-Agent Systems: [25] evaluates norm compliance and social adaptability.”\n\n- Multi-agent/collaborative evaluation adds purpose-built measures:\n  - “frameworks like [51] employ fine-grained metrics (e.g., progress rate) to track incremental advancements in multi-agent interactions.”\n  - “Competitive benchmarks, like those in [61], assess agents’ negotiation and goal-alignment abilities.”\n\n- Robustness/adversarial testing metrics and settings:\n  - “Adversarial testing probes LLM agents' resilience against intentional manipulations, such as prompt injection or jailbreaking attacks [103].”\n  - “metrics like adaptation speed (time to adjust to new tasks) and recovery rate (error correction success)… attack success rate and faithfulness (output consistency under manipulation).”\n\n- Ethical/fairness evaluation and fairness-aware metrics:\n  - “many benchmarks rely on datasets skewed toward specific demographics… leading to unfair performance disparities.”\n  - “fairness-aware metrics, including disparity ratios and counterfactual fairness tests, to quantify bias propagation across subgroups.”\n\nReasons for not awarding 5/5:\n- Labeling protocols, annotator workflows, and dataset construction details are generally not described. For example, while some scale/scenario details are given (“LIBERO… 130 manipulation tasks”), most datasets/benchmarks lack information on labeling schemes, annotation quality control, or inter-rater agreement.\n- Some benchmarks/tools are referenced with limited clarity and no provenance or scale details (e.g., “PPTC-R,” “NPHardEval,” “AgentSims”), making their applicability and maturity uncertain.\n- Although metrics are well-categorized and justified, formal metric definitions and concrete evaluation setups (e.g., exact splits, sampling, or statistical validation procedures) are not provided.\n\nOverall, the survey reports several datasets/benchmarks and a rich set of metrics with reasonable justification, but falls short of detailed dataset construction/labeling descriptions and sometimes cites benchmarks with minimal specificity.", "Score: 4\n\nJustification:\nThe survey offers multi-dimensional comparative analysis across several method families (e.g., modular vs. hierarchical vs. hybrid architectures; centralized vs. self-organizing coordination; RAG vs. fine-tuning; single-agent RL vs. MARL; large vs. small/edge models). It frequently discusses advantages/trade-offs (scalability, interpretability, robustness, latency, safety) and includes explicit contrastive phrasing in multiple sections. However, comparisons are distributed rather than consolidated, similarities are less explicitly articulated, and there is no dedicated side-by-side matrix or table. Some contrasts remain high-level rather than systematically enumerated across the same dimensions for each method.\n\nContrastive quotes (verbatim):\n- “Hybrid architectures combine the strengths of modular and hierarchical designs, often integrating symbolic or cognitive frameworks with LLMs to enhance robustness.” (Section 2.1)\n- “Modular architectures offer distinct advantages over monolithic alternatives:” (Section 3.1)\n- “In contrast to hierarchical control, self-organizing architectures leverage decentralized interactions to achieve global objectives, foreshadowing the context-aware adaptability of Section 3.3.” (Section 3.2)\n- “To address the latency limitations of traditional LLM-based agents, recent frameworks adopt modular designs that decouple deliberation from execution.” (Section 3.6)\n- “While larger models generally exhibit better reasoning and generalization capabilities, their inference latency and memory footprint make them impractical for real-time applications.” (Section 6.3)\n- “In healthcare, [131] addresses this challenge by employing a constellation of smaller, task-specific LLMs instead of a single monolithic model.” (Section 6.3)\n- “While RAG enhances agents through external knowledge integration, fine-tuning optimizes the internal model parameters themselves, enabling LLM-based agents to achieve higher task-specific performance with reduced computational overhead.” (Section 7.2)\n- “MARL addresses a critical gap in traditional reinforcement learning by modeling interactions between multiple LLM agents in shared environments.” (Section 7.4)\n\nWhy not a 5:\n- The paper lacks a single, structured side-by-side comparative framework that clearly enumerates similarities, differences, and pros/cons across common axes for each method.\n- Similarities between methods are less explicitly stated than differences/trade-offs.\n- Some comparative statements are generic or narrative rather than systematically

causes and real-world impacts while proposing mitigation avenues. The gaps are explicitly stated and revisited with deeper causal explanations (e.g., token-prediction training causing hallucinations; finite context windows and attention decay limiting long-horizon reasoning; high computational demands hindering real-time deployment; regulatory misfit with generative, autonomous behaviors). The paper also ties gaps to domain risks (healthcare, finance, robotics), and repeatedly connects them to consequences (trust, safety, scalability, equity), which satisfies the “causes and potential impact” requirement.\n\nRepresentative gap statements (direct quotes):\n\nMethodology and evaluation gaps\n- “the field lacks standardized evaluation methodologies and benchmarks. Current works like [51] and [52] highlight the challenges in assessing agent performance across diverse scenarios. Without consistent evaluation frameworks, it becomes difficult to gauge progress or identify areas needing improvement.” (Section 1.4)\n- “Key challenges persist in LLM agent evaluation: 1. Unified Frameworks… 2. Dynamic Robustness Testing… 3. Ethical Alignment Metrics…” (Section 8.1)\n\nUnderexplored multi-agent and human-agent collaboration\n- “Another gap lies in the under-exploration of multi-agent systems. Although [59] and [47] provide foundational insights, they do not fully address scalability or emergent behaviors in large-scale agent societies.” (Section 1.4)\n- “the underexplored area of human-agent collaboration… often overlook long-term adaptation or trust-building.” (Section 1.4)\n\nCore technical limitations and their causes/impacts\n- “A persistent challenge for LLM-based agents is their tendency to generate plausible but factually incorrect or nonsensical outputs, known as hallucination… This issue stems from their training paradigm, which optimizes for token prediction rather than factual grounding.” (Section 2.5)\n- “The finite context window of LLMs restricts their ability to process and retain long sequences of information… The computational cost of processing long sequences further exacerbates this limitation, making real-time applications impractical for many use cases.” (Section 2.5)\n- “LLM-based agents struggle to adapt dynamically to evolving environments or user needs due to their static training paradigm. Knowledge remains frozen post-training, requiring manual intervention or costly retraining for updates.” (Section 2.5)\n- “LLM-based agents often exhibit fragility when confronted with complex or ambiguous inputs… even simple logical relationships can trip up LLMs when faced with adversarial perturbations.” (Section 2.5)\n\nMemory mechanisms: scalability, consistency, privacy\n- “Scalability: Unbounded memory growth risks performance degradation.” (Section 2.6)\n- “Consistency: Coherence between memory updates and actions remains difficult.” (Section 2.6)\n- “Privacy: Sensitive data exposure during retrieval persists… albeit with latency trade-offs.” (Section 2.6)\n\nArchitectural gaps in modular, hierarchical, multimodal systems\n- “Coordination Overhead: Inter-module communication can introduce latency…” and “Interface Reliability: Poorly designed module interfaces may cause information degradation…” (Section 3.1)\n- “Key limitations include: Hierarchies: Central coordinator bottlenecks… Self-organization: Unpredictable emergent behaviors.” (Section 3.2)\n- “Modality Gaps… Real-Time Processing… Hallucinations in Multimodal Settings…” (Section 3.3)\n- “Combining RAG and memory systems introduces design complexities… synchronization overhead and privacy risks remain open issues…” (Section 3.4)\n\nScalability, performance, and energy/cost constraints\n- “One of the foremost challenges in scaling LLM-based agents is their immense computational demand.” (Section 6.3)\n- “Scaling LLM agents to handle millions of concurrent users introduces inefficiencies in memory usage, latency, and energy consumption.” (Section 6.3)\n- “The relationship between model size and performance is nonlinear… inference latency and memory footprint make them impractical for real-time applications.” (Section 6.3)\n\nBias, fairness, privacy, and security gaps\n- “Biases in LLM agents primarily emerge from… training data and the alignment processes… they inevitably inherit societal prejudices…” (Section 6.2)\n- “A foundational challenge lies in the opaque handling of training and operational data… models trained on scraped web data may internalize and later reproduce sensitive details…” (Section 6.4)\n- “Among the most prevalent threats to LLM agents are prompt injection attacks…” (Section 6.7)\n\nRegulatory misalignment and accountability\n- “Current regulatory frameworks… fail to accommodate the dynamic and generative nature of LLM agents.” (Section 6.6)\n- “The ‘black-box’ nature of LLM decision-making complicates accountability, especially in applications where actions have tangible consequences.” (Section 10.3)\n\nTheoretical/frontier gaps\n- “Meta-ethical uncertainty—how to align AGI systems with human values when ethical frameworks themselves are dynamic and culturally diverse.” (Section 9.6)\n- “‘Small-world’ vs. ‘large-world’ problem… [229] reports a mere 3% success rate in autonomous complex task planning, attributing this to LLMs’ lack of intrinsic world models.” (Section 9.6)\n\nWhy this merits 5/5:\n- Multiple major gaps are clearly articulated across evaluation, architecture, learning, deployment, ethics, security, and regulation.\n- Causes are explicitly analyzed (e.g., token-prediction objective; context window and attention decay; static post-training knowledge; inter-module communication overhead; data bias; opacity).\n- Potential impacts are consistently tied to real-world risk (e.g., clinical harm, market risk, safety in robotics, trust erosion, inequity, energy footprint) and include concrete consequences (latency, brittleness, regulatory non-compliance).\n- The work often proposes mitigation directions (RAG, memory/pruning, standardized interfaces, hybrid neuro-symbolic methods, HITL, privacy tech, auditing/sandboxes), indicating depth beyond mere listing.\n\nIf any downgrade were considered, it would be for occasional lack of quantitative impact estimates in certain domains and some repetition of known challenges; however, the breadth, specificity, and causal-impact linkage remain strong overall.", "5/5\n\nQuoted future-work sentences:\n- “Future directions include enhancing robustness, expanding multimodality, and ensuring ethical deployment [14].”\n- “Building on current capabilities and challenges, three frontiers stand out: 1.
