There is no explicit statement of the research objective in an Abstract. This omission requires a downgrade per the requirement to assess clarity in both Abstract and Introduction.\n- Introduction – explicit objective statements:\n  - Section 1.7 (“Scope and Structure of the Survey”): The paper explicitly states its survey objective and scope: “this survey systematically examines continual learning (CL) in large language models (LLMs) through three interconnected lenses: methodologies, applications, and future directions.”\n  - Section 1.7 further clarifies intent and organization: “The survey is structured to guide readers from foundational concepts to cutting-edge innovations,” and “By organizing the survey thematically, we bridge theoretical advancements with practical implementations while highlighting open challenges and research opportunities.”\n  These sentences provide a clear, but general, articulation of the survey’s aims.\n- Introduction – background and motivation linking to core problems:\n  - Section 1.1 (“Definition and Scope of Continual Learning in LLMs”) provides background and motivation tied to core issues: “catastrophic forgetting—the abrupt loss of prior knowledge when learning new tasks [2],” and the need to balance “plasticity (adapting to new tasks) and stability (preserving old knowledge) [5].”\n  - Section 1.2 (“Significance of Continual Learning for LLMs”) motivates the work with concrete drivers such as cost and timeliness: “CL provides a pragmatic solution by enabling targeted, incremental updates that dramatically reduce computational overhead while maintaining model performance.”\n  - Section 1.3 (“Key Challenges in Continual Learning for LLMs”) explicitly enumerates core problems: “Catastrophic forgetting,” “The Plasticity-Stability Dilemma,” and “Computational and Energy Bottlenecks.”\n  These sections supply strong background and motivation connected to recognized field challenges.\n- Reason for conservative scoring:\n  - The explicit objective appears only in Section 1.7 and is stated in general terms (e.g., “systematically examines… through three lenses”) rather than precise research questions or narrowly defined goals.\n  - There is no Abstract with an explicit objective, and earlier Introduction subsections (1.1–1.6) do not explicitly state the survey’s objective.\n  - Therefore, while the Introduction contains a clear (but general) objective and strong motivation, the absence of an Abstract and the broad phrasing merit a score of 3 under the stricter criteria.", "5\n\nExplicit classification evidence:\n- “3 Methodologies for Continual Learning in LLMs” is systematically organized into distinct method families:\n  - “3.1 Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) Methods”\n  - “3.2 Replay-Based and Memory-Augmented Approaches”\n  - “3.3 Knowledge Distillation for Continual Adaptation”\n  - “3.4 Dynamic Architecture Adaptation”\n  - “3.5 Hybrid and Multi-Task Adaptation Frameworks”\n  - “3.6 Token-Level and Layer-Wise Adaptation”\n- Within theoretical grounding, categories are further delineated:\n  - “2.2 Memory Replay and Experience Replay” (with subtypes)\n  - “2.3 Regularization Techniques” (Consistency Regularization; Weight Constraints; Hybrid and Advanced Regularization)\n  - “2.4 Architectural Adaptations” (Mixture-of-Experts (MoE); Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT); Dynamic Architecture Adaptation via Modular Design; Hybrid and Multi-Task Adaptation Frameworks)\n\nExplicit development/evolution evidence:\n- “Evolving LoRA Variants for Continual Learning” introduces concrete stages of PEFT evolution:\n  - “1. Rank-Stabilized LoRA (rsLoRA)…”\n  - “2. Sparse Low-Rank Adaptation (SoRA)…”\n  - “3. Dynamic Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA)…”\n- ER progression is made explicit: “Recent advancements have introduced specialized ER variants… 1. Gradient-Based Replay… 2. Dynamic Memory Replay… 3. Task-Aware Replay…”\n- Architectural evolution is explicitly framed: “Key Methodologies and Their Evolution,” including\n  - “1. Modular Architectures: From MoLA to Collaborative Systems”\n  - “2. Parameter-Efficient Dynamic Adaptation: The X-LoRA Paradigm”\n  - “3. Emerging Hybrid Architectures”\n- Trend-to-practice progression is consolidated in “3.8 Emerging Innovations and Scalable Systems,” with staged themes:\n  - “Scalable Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning… S-LoRA… MultiLoRA… Hybrid approaches like Hydra…”\n  - “Test-Time Adaptation and Real-Time Learning… PLUTO… Advantage Model…”\n  - “Scalable Systems for Production Environments…”\n  - “Innovations in Memory and Replay Mechanisms…”", "Score: 4/5\n\nEvidence:\n- “For vertical CL, benchmarks like [63] evaluate domain-specific task retention across eight diverse datasets, including mathematical reasoning and code generation. TRACE reveals that fine-tuned LLMs often suffer significant declines in both task-specific performance and general instruction-following capabilities.” (Section 1.5)\n- “Horizontal CL benchmarks, such as [64], focus on cross-domain adaptability in dynamic environments. LiveCodeBench leverages real-world programming scenarios (e.g., self-repair, test output prediction) sourced from platforms like LeetCode, ensuring evaluation free from data contamination.” (Section 1.5)\n- “Similarly, [65] assesses LLMs across the software development lifecycle, exposing limitations in managing hierarchical task dependencies—a critical requirement for horizontal CL in complex workflows.” (Section 1.5)\n- “Effective CL evaluation requires metrics that capture both task performance and broader model dynamics: 1. Task Retention… 2. Forward/Backward Transfer… 3. Computational Efficiency.” (Section 1.5)\n- “Average Accuracy (AA)… Forgetting Measure (FM)… Retention Rate (RR)… Forward Transfer (FWT)… Backward Transfer (BWT)… Domain Adaptation Gap (DAG)… Generalization Error (GE)… Training Time per Task… Parameter Efficiency… Memory Footprint.” (Section 5.1)\n- “LongICLBench… tests LLMs' ability to maintain coherence across extended sequences… dynamic task injection mechanism… aligns with horizontal CL scenarios.” (Section 5.2)\n- “EvolvingQA implements knowledge transfer metrics (FWT/BWT) through incrementally updated QA tasks that mirror real-world knowledge evolution… granular evaluation separates ‘old’ versus ‘new’ question accuracy.” (Section 5.2)\n- “TRACE operationalizes retention and computational efficiency metrics through controlled task-sequence experiments… studies using TRACE demonstrate that… DoRA reduce forgetting by 30% compared to full fine-tuning.” (Section 5.2)\n- “Dynamic benchmarks simulate real-world distribution shifts… Self-Evolving Tasks: Benchmarks like EvoEval progressively modify tasks… Adversarial Evaluation: Frameworks like RefuteBench generate counterfactual examples to test logical consistency.” (Section 5.4)\n- “Data contamination… TS-Guessing methods… proprietary LLMs can guess missing options… 57% exact match rate in MMLU for GPT-4… Benchmarks like [64] that continuously collect fresh problems… ensure temporal separation.” (Section 5.5)\n\nRationale for score:\n- Strengths:\n  - The survey covers multiple benchmarks and datasets across domains (e.g., TRACE, LongICLBench, EvolvingQA, LiveCodeBench, DevBench), and explicitly connects them to CL settings (vertical vs. horizontal) and challenges (e.g., contamination, dynamic shifts).\n  - Metrics are comprehensively presented with categories, names, and intended purposes (e.g., AA, FM, FWT/BWT, DAG, GE, efficiency metrics), along with gaps and emerging composite metrics (e.g., TSI, CE, LGS).\n  - The use of certain datasets/benchmarks is justified (e.g., LiveCodeBench’s contamination-free design and dynamic sourcing; EvolvingQA’s temporal updates to mirror real-world evolution).\n\n- Limitations (leading to downgrade from 5 to 4):\n  - Descriptions often lack concrete details of dataset scale and labeling protocols (e.g., dataset sizes, annotation schemes, task composition statistics are generally not provided).\n  - Several benchmarks are referenced without systematic reporting of scenarios beyond brief characterizations (e.g., multimodal benchmarks and dynamic frameworks are named but not described with detailed configurations or data splits).\n  - While the survey justifies benchmark selection conceptually, it does not consistently articulate why particular datasets are preferred for specific CL phenomena beyond high-level alignment (e.g., few explicit links between labeling strategies and the metrics used to measure forgetting or transfer).", "Score: 5/5\n\nJustification:\nThe survey provides a structured, multi-dimensional comparative analysis across methods, explicitly contrasting:\n- paradigms (replay, regularization, architectural/PEFT, hybrids),\n- performance dimensions (accuracy, forward/backward transfer, catastrophic forgetting),\n- efficiency (compute, memory, scalability),\n- robustness to domain shifts (multilingual, vertical domains, multimodal),\n- integration with pre-training, fine-tuning, and RAG.\n\nIt clearly states similarities, differences, and advantages/disadvantages with contrastive wording and, in several places, quantitative contrasts. Section 7 (7.2–7.5) is especially thorough, but earlier sections (1.4, 3.5, 3.6, 5.2) also give structured comparisons.\n\nRepresentative contrastive quotes:\n\n- Vertical vs. Horizontal CL\n  - “Depth vs. Breadth: VCL prioritizes domain expertise; HCL emphasizes cross-task generalization.”\n  - “Data Needs: VCL relies on domain-specific data; HCL requires diverse, multi-domain corpora.”\n  - “Evaluation: VCL benchmarks… assess specialization, while HCL benchmarks… measure generalization.”\n\n- Replay vs. Regularization vs. Architectural (and hybrids)\n  - “Replay-based methods… mitigate catastrophic forgetting… however, replay-based methods… strain memory and compute resources by storing and processing historical data.”\n  - “Regularization-based methods… penalize changes to important parameters… however, LLMs’ high-dimensional parameter spaces complicate identifying critical weights without overly restricting plasticity.”\n  - “Architectural methods… dynamically modify model structures to balance plasticity and stability… however, challenges persist in expert selection and load balancing.”\n\n- PEFT variants and efficiency trade-offs (7.2)\n  - “LoRA excels in single-task efficiency; MultiLoRA trades compute for flexibility; BBox-Adapter balances both but requires precise task-space alignment.”\n  - “Memory-constrained scenarios favor LoRA, while dynamic multitasking may justify MultiLoRA’s higher overhead.”\n\n- Accuracy/retention vs. efficiency (7.3)\n  - “Replay-based methods demonstrate strong backward transfer… However, their memory storage demands create scalability bottlenecks.”\n  - “PEFT methods like LoRA exhibit superior forward transfer… Yet, their backward transfer falters during significant distribution shifts.”\n  - “Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models reduce forgetting… however, their expert routing complexity parallels the scalability challenges noted for MultiLoRA.”\n\n- Token-level vs. Layer-wise adaptation (3.6)\n  - “Token-level methods excel in backward compatibility (semantic drift reduction)… Layer-wise approaches show superior forward transfer to novel tasks.”\n\n- Hybrid frameworks (3.5)\n  - “Hydra… combines the strengths of mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures with memory replay… reducing memory overhead by up to 40% compared to standalone replay or MoE implementations.”\n\n- Dynamic architectures vs. static (3.4)\n  - “Unlike static architectures, these methods provide explicit mechanisms to balance plasticity… X-LoRA… with 30% reduction in forgetting compared to static LoRA.”\n\n- Benchmarks comparison (5.2)\n  - “LongICLBench… However, synthetic data limitations reduce its applicability to real-world multilingual settings.”\n  - “EvolvingQA… While its text-centric design limits multimodal evaluation…”\n  - “TRACE… However, its assumption of discrete task boundaries contrasts with real-world gradual shifts.”\n\n- Integration with RAG and PRE (7.5)\n  - “RAG complements CL by offloading part of the knowledge retention burden… However, a key limitation… is the dependency on retrieval corpus quality.”\n  - “PRE alone is insufficient for lifelong learning… This underscores the need for hybrid approaches that marry PRE’s domain strength with CL’s adaptability.”\n\nThese contrasts are repeated across multiple sections and dimensions (efficiency, robustness, retention/transfer, scalability), meeting the “structured, multi-dimensional” requirement with explicit pros/cons and clear comparative wording.", "Score: 4/5\n\nEvidence of explicit analytical reasoning (why differences arise, trade-offs, limitations, implications):\n\n- “Traditional CL methods, such as replay-based techniques or regularization, often fail to scale efficiently due to the quadratic complexity of transformer attention mechanisms.” (Explains a concrete scaling cause tied to transformer design.)\n\n- “The massive parameter counts of LLMs… amplify computational costs and memory overhead during incremental updates.” (Connects model size to resource burdens and CL feasibility.)\n\n- “While pre-trained LLMs provide strong initial representations, their static nature conflicts with CL's dynamic requirements… PEFT methods… must balance sparsity (to reduce compute) with expressive power (to maintain performance).” (Identifies a core design trade-off in PEFT.)\n\n- “Catastrophic forgetting… is amplified in LLMs due to their reliance on gradient-based optimization, which inherently prioritizes new data over old.” (Causal mechanism for CF in LLMs.)\n\n- “Gradient alignment plays a key role: conflicting gradients between old and new tasks drive forgetting. Techniques like elastic weight consolidation (EWC) mitigate this by penalizing changes to important parameters.” (Explains why EWC helps and the underlying dynamics.)\n\n- “The information bottleneck principle suggests forgetting occurs when task-specific features are over-compressed, losing discriminative power.” (Theoretical explanation for representational drift/forgetting.)\n\n- “Experience replay… faces unique challenges due to the scale and diversity of textual data… underscoring the need for adaptive memory management to handle such nonstationary environments.” (Limitations and an implication for ER design.)\n\n- “Memory overhead… sample selection bias… temporal decay: Older memories may lose relevance as data distributions shift… LLMs regenerate and prune outdated samples, mimicking human memory consolidation.” (Enumerates trade-offs with implications for buffer curation and decay.)\n\n- “Dropout implicitly creates task-specific pathways, balancing plasticity and stability without explicit structural changes.” (Mechanistic rationale for a regularization method reducing interference.)\n\n- “By allocating new tasks to underutilized or newly instantiated experts, MoE frameworks minimize interference with existing knowledge while supporting incremental learning.” (Design principle and its implication.)\n\n- “Retrieval-augmented generation complements CL by offloading part of the knowledge retention burden to external retrieval systems… dependency on retrieval corpus quality.” (Clear trade-off of RAG-based CL.)\n\n- “Benchmarks like TRACE… assume discrete task boundaries, whereas dynamic frameworks… could better simulate real-world incremental learning.” (Limitation in evaluation design and its consequence.)\n\n- “Replay-based methods… strain memory and compute resources by storing and processing historical data,” whereas “Parameter-efficient fine-tuning… offers partial relief… However, scalability remains a challenge for long task sequences.” (Contrasts two families and surfaces a joint limitation.)\n\n- “LLMs exhibit sensitivity to domain shifts… Solutions combining domain-adaptive pre-training (DAPT) with replay buffers… anticipate the salience-based parameter updates… while noting energy and compute costs of replay.” (Links robustness gains to resource implications.)\n\n- “Inverse relationship between fine-tuning performance and forgetting in LoRA-based systems… underscores the need for architectures that inherently resist forgetting.” (Highlights an empirical trade-off with design implications.)\n\n- “Low-resource languages remain problematic due to tokenization biases and uneven pre-training representation… cross-lingual prompting mitigates but does not close the gap.” (Explains why multilingual gaps persist and assesses mitigation limits.)\n\n- “Federated learning preserves data locality but introduces communication overhead and fairness disparities… necessitating optimization and fairness-aware aggregation.” (FL-CL trade-offs and constraints.)\n\n- “Optimal CL solutions are proven NP-hard without perfect memory, necessitating approximations like rehearsal or distillation.” (Foundational limitation and its practical implication.)\n\nWhy not a 5: While the survey repeatedly identifies causes, trade-offs, and implications across methods and benchmarks, some analyses remain high-level (e.g., frequent generic statements like “future work should…” without concrete ablations or mechanistic depth), and several claims would benefit from tighter linkage to empirical evidence or quantitative regimes (e.g., when PEFT fails, layer sensitivity profiles, or replay budget vs. retention curves). Thus, the critical reasoning is solid but not uniformly deep.\n\nResearch guidance value: High. The analysis consistently surfaces design tensions (e.g., plasticity vs. stability, retention vs. efficiency, RAG externalization vs. corpus freshness), evaluation gaps (static vs. dynamic benchmarks), and deployment constraints (privacy, energy, federated communication), offering clear directions for method and benchmark development.", "Score: 5/5\n\nJustification:\nThe survey identifies multiple major research gaps across theory, methods, benchmarks, deployment, and ethics, and it repeatedly analyzes their causes and potential impacts. The authors not only enumerate gaps but also explain why they occur (e.g., scale, non-stationarity, compute/energy limits, benchmark contamination, task interference, privacy risks) and what they lead to in practice (e.g., catastrophic forgetting, degraded general capabilities, fairness erosion, infeasible deployment, environmental costs). They consistently pair gaps with concrete future directions, indicating a deep understanding rather than superficial listing.\n\nRepresentative gap statements (verbatim quotes with context):\n\nTheoretical and algorithmic gaps\n- “Key open questions include: 1. Dynamic Capacity Allocation: Can LLMs adjust their capacity for new tasks without retraining? [45] explores null-space learning, but scalability remains unproven. 2.

Ethical Intersections: How do biases propagate in CL, and how can they be mitigated?” (Section 1.3)\n- “Key open challenges include: 1. Scalability: CL methods are rarely tested on billion-parameter LLMs, leaving efficacy for models like GPT-4 uncertain [1]. 2. Pre-training vs. CL: The interplay between static pre-training and dynamic CL remains underexplored [11]. 3. Self-supervised learning: Objectives like masked language modeling blur old/new task boundaries, complicating forgetting quantification [111].” (Section 2.1)\n- “Despite progress, key gaps remain.
