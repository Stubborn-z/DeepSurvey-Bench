The Introduction explicitly delineates the survey’s organizing pillars: “The core principles of LLMs in telecommunications revolve around three key aspects: architecture, pre-training, and fine-tuning,” and it sets expectations for coverage of deployment, ethical issues, and future directions (“Emerging trends highlight the convergence of LLMs with next-generation networks, such as 6G and semantic communication… Federated learning and edge-compatible models… Yet, ethical considerations…”). It also closes with a clear statement of intent and scope: “The synthesis of historical advancements, technical innovations, and emerging applications presented here lays the groundwork for subsequent discussions on foundational architectures and key techniques in this survey.” These passages collectively make the objective sufficiently specific for a survey article and aligned with core field issues (real-time processing, scalability, domain-specific language understanding).\n- Background and Motivation: The Introduction provides a strong contextual grounding. It traces the historical evolution from transformer-based general-purpose LLMs (e.g., GPT/BERT) to telecom-centric adaptations (“Historically, LLMs emerged from advancements in transformer architectures… adapted to telecom-specific applications, such as network diagnostics and customer service automation”), and articulates clear domain demands driving this evolution (“unique demands of telecommunications, including real-time processing, scalability, and the need for domain-specific language understanding”). It further motivates the work by identifying pressing challenges (“real-time processing constraints and the need for robust domain-specific language understanding”) and specifying telecom-specific data characteristics (network logs, 3GPP standards, customer transcripts).\n- Practical Significance and Guidance Value: The Introduction demonstrates strong practical relevance. It highlights key application areas (“Automation of network management… multilingual customer support and sentiment analysis”) and ties them to enabling techniques (MoE, LoRA, RLHF, RAG, federated learning), while also foregrounding constraints and trade-offs (“trade-offs between model performance and resource efficiency… ethical considerations, including bias mitigation and regulatory compliance”). The forward-looking orientation (“Future research must bridge gaps in scalability, real-time processing, and interdisciplinary collaboration”) provides actionable guidance for researchers and practitioners, indicating where further work is needed.\n\nReasons for not awarding 5/5:\n- The Abstract is missing from the provided text. For a survey, a concise Abstract that lays out the objective, scope, taxonomy, and main contributions is important to maximize clarity.\n- The Introduction, while comprehensive, does not explicitly enumerate research questions, contributions, or a formal taxonomy statement (e.g., “This survey contributes: (1)… (2)… (3)…”). Such an explicit contributions paragraph would strengthen objective clarity and guidance value.\n- Scope boundaries (what is out of scope) and methodological stance (e.g., how studies were selected, evaluation criteria for inclusion) are not described in the Introduction, which slightly reduces the precision of the research direction.\n\nOverall, the Introduction clearly states the survey’s purpose, provides substantial background and motivation, and articulates strong practical significance, but the absence of an Abstract and a formalized contributions/objectives paragraph keeps the score at 4 rather than 5.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey presents a relatively clear and coherent classification of methods and a reasonable depiction of their evolution, though some connections and stages could be more explicitly unified.\n\n- Method Classification Clarity\n  - The paper establishes a clear foundational taxonomy early on: “The core principles of LLMs in telecommunications revolve around three key aspects: architecture, pre-training, and fine-tuning” (Section 1 Introduction). This anchors the methodological structure.\n  - Section 2 (“Foundational Architectures and Training Paradigms”) systematically elaborates these pillars:\n    - 2.1 (Transformer-Based Architectures) classifies architectural methods (sparse/MoE designs, dynamic attention, lightweight variants, retrieval-augmented and neuro-symbolic hybrids).\n    - 2.2 (Telecom-Specific Pre-Training) covers tokenization/embedding, multimodal pre-training, self-supervised objectives—clearly scoped to telecom data characteristics.\n    - 2.3 (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) differentiates LoRA, RLHF, prompt tuning/adapters, and their trade-offs for telecom tasks.\n    - 2.4 (Scalability and Deployment) distinguishes distributed inference, energy efficiency, orchestration, multi-adapter serving—mapping to real-world telecom constraints.\n    - 2.5 (Emerging Architectures and Hybrid Approaches) frames RAG, MM-LLMs, neuro-symbolic systems, federated and edge-compatible designs as hybrid solutions.\n  - The “Key Techniques for Telecom-Specific Applications” in Section 3 further classifies method families by application: NLP automation (3.1), configuration and optimization (3.2), security (3.3), multimodal integration (3.4), performance optimization and scalability (3.5), and hybrid approaches (3.6). Each subsection is scoped and names concrete techniques (e.g., in 3.1: RAG, multilingual adapters; in 3.2: intent-based configuration; in 3.3: adversarial robustness, federated security; in 3.4: cross-modal fusion, QA-LoRA; in 3.5: speculative decoding, model parallelism).\n  - The classification is reinforced in Sections 4–5 by mapping methods to applications and evaluation/benchmarking, showing how techniques are deployed and assessed in telecom scenarios.\n\n- Evolution of Methodology\n  - The narrative explicitly signals progression between method stages:\n    - From general LLMs to telecom-centric adaptations (Introduction: “transition from general NLP to telecom-centric LLMs involves specialized pre-training…”).\n    - From architectures to efficiency and deployment (2.4: “a natural progression from the parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods discussed earlier” and “foreshadowing the multimodal and retrieval-augmented techniques…”).\n    - From foundational methods to hybrids (2.5: “Three key approaches—retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), multimodal LLMs (MM-LLMs), and neuro-symbolic integration—are reshaping LLM deployment…”).\n    - From NLP to optimization and security (3.2: “building upon their demonstrated capabilities in telecom-specific NLP tasks”; 3.3 references multimodal and self-supervised objectives discussed earlier).\n    - Across sections, connective phrases (“seamlessly transitioning,” “natural progression,” “foreshadowing,” “building upon”) consistently guide the reader through the methodological evolution.\n  - Future-oriented evolution is laid out in Section 7 (Future Directions): integration with next-generation networks and semantic communication (7.1), privacy-preserving and federated paradigms (7.2), multimodal/cross-domain LLMs (7.3), scalability and efficiency (7.4), regulatory/ethical frameworks (7.5), and emerging research directions (7.6). These subsections tie back to earlier methods and explicitly identify trends and open problems.\n  - The survey also embeds trade-offs and transitions (e.g., 2.1 on sparse/MoE vs. load balancing; 2.3 on LoRA vs. nonlinear patterns; 3.5 on speculative decoding and distributed inference; 4.5 on energy-latency trade-offs), indicating how method choices evolved to meet telecom constraints.\n\n- Areas for Improvement (why not 5)\n  - Taxonomy overlap and fragmentation: Hybrid architectures/methods appear repeatedly across 2.5 and 3.6; performance optimization spans both 2.4 and 3.5; security methods are covered in 3.3 and revisited in 4.3. While context differs, a consolidated taxonomy or figure mapping layers (architecture → training → adaptation → deployment → hybrid → application) would strengthen coherence.\n  - Evolution staging is implicit rather than explicitly chronological. The paper signals transitions but does not provide a clear timeline or phased development (e.g., early dense transformers → sparse/MoE → PEFT → hybrid RAG/neuro-symbolic → multimodal/federated) with milestones tied to telecom adoption.\n  - Some cross-references are rhetorical (“foreshadowing,” “bridging”) rather than analytical, and certain evolutionary connections (e.g., how benchmarks in 5 catalyze method shifts in 2–3) could be more thoroughly synthesized.\n\nOverall, the paper reflects the technological development of LLMs in telecom with a structured and connected classification and a reasonably systematic evolution narrative, but it falls short of a fully unified taxonomy and explicit evolution stages. Hence, 4 points.", "Score: 3/5\n\nExplanation:\n- Diversity of datasets: The survey mentions a few telecom-specific benchmarks but provides limited breadth and detail. In Section 5.1, it references “datasets like [90]” (TSpec-LLM) and highlights “TeleQnA” [26] as enabling reproducible evaluation of 3GPP understanding and telecom knowledge. These appear repeatedly (e.g., Section 3.3 references “TelecomQnA benchmark datasets [26]”; Section 5.3 notes “<2% drop in TeleQnA benchmarks [26]”). Beyond these, most data sources are described generically (e.g., “3GPP standards, network logs, customer service transcripts” in Sections 1 and 2.2) rather than as curated datasets with stated properties. Frameworks such as LMMs-Eval [146], RouterBench [128], and Vidur [126] are cited as evaluation or simulation tools (Section 5.5), but the survey does not provide a wider catalog of telecom datasets (e.g., public intrusion detection corpora, labeled trouble-ticket sets, annotated multimodal logs) with scope or composition details.\n- Detail and rationale on datasets are minimal: The paper does not describe dataset scale, labeling protocols, splits, or languages. For example, in Section 4.4 the claim that “[90] provides a benchmark dataset that enables LLMs to answer technical queries with 71–75% accuracy when augmented with RAG” does not include dataset size, annotation method, or task breakdown. Similarly, while [104] and [26] are cited for document categorization and telecom QA, there is no discussion of how these datasets were constructed or balanced (Section 4.4; Section 5.1).\n- Diversity and rationality of metrics: The survey does a better job here, covering metrics that are both academically common and operationally meaningful for telecom:\n  - Latency and throughput for real-time systems (Section 3.5: “time-to-first-token (TTFT) and tokens-per-second (TPS)”; Section 4.5 discusses latency reduction; Section 5.1 integrates latency constraints into fault detection evaluation).\n  - Energy efficiency (Section 3.5: “joules per token”; Section 5.2 roofline analysis and memory-bound inference; Section 5.5 sustainability-aware metrics; Section 6.1 quantifies carbon footprint concerns).\n  - Task-specific accuracy metrics (Section 5.1: precision-recall for diagnostics; Section 4.2: BLEU-4 for speech-to-text translation; Section 4.2: sentiment F1-scores; Section 4.3: precision in intrusion detection).\n  - Robustness and security metrics (Section 5.1: “False Positive Rate Under Attack (FPRA)” for adversarial robustness; Section 5.3: stress testing under load and adversarial settings).\n  - Time-series evaluation (Section 5.1: “Mean Absolute Scaled Error” for forecasting).\n  - RAG evaluation (Section 5.1 and 5.5 discuss retrieval-augmented protocols and hallucination rates).\n  These choices are largely appropriate and tied to telecom constraints (e.g., URLLC-like latency, QoS compliance in Section 4.5).\n- Missing metric definitions and depth: While many metrics are named, the survey rarely defines them or explains how they are applied per task. For example, FPRA (Section 5.1) is introduced without formal definition or examples; QoS compliance (Section 4.5) is cited as “15–25% better” without specifying which QoS indicators (latency, jitter, packet loss) or how measured; energy metrics are mentioned but not standardized across scenarios. Section 5.1 acknowledges gaps explicitly: “lack of unified metrics for cross-modal tasks,” “insufficient attention to energy efficiency during inference,” and “limited benchmarks for continual learning scenarios,” which supports the assessment that metric coverage is acknowledged but not fully systematized.\n- Practical linkage between metrics and tasks: There is clear effort to tie metrics to real-world telecom requirements (e.g., TTFT/TPS for diagnostics in Section 3.5; latency constraints in Sections 4.5 and 5.1; adversarial robustness for security in Sections 4.3 and 5.3). This strengthens rationality, even if execution detail is thin.\n- Overall judgment: The survey’s metric coverage is broad and largely reasonable for telecom contexts, but dataset coverage is narrow and lacks critical detail (scale, labeling, splits, multilingual aspects). The paper often cites benchmarks (TeleQnA [26], TSpec-LLM [90]) and evaluation frameworks but does not comprehensively catalog datasets nor provide detailed descriptions that would meet the 5-point standard. The acknowledgment of benchmarking gaps (Section 5.1; Section 5.5) further indicates that the dataset/metric landscape is only partially covered. Therefore, a 3/5 reflects limited dataset diversity and detail, with stronger—though still not exhaustive—metric coverage and reasonable alignment to telecom tasks.", "Score: 4/5\n\nExplanation:\nThe review provides a clear and largely systematic comparison of methods across the core dimensions relevant to telecom LLMs—architecture, pre-training, fine-tuning, deployment, and hybridization—while identifying advantages, disadvantages, and trade-offs with good technical grounding. However, it falls short of a fully systematic cross-method synthesis (e.g., no unifying taxonomy or side-by-side criteria applied consistently to all methods), and some subsections remain narrative rather than comparative.\n\nStrengths in clarity, rigor, and depth:\n- Explains architectural distinctions and trade-offs with concrete metrics and constraints:\n  - Section 2.1 contrasts dense transformers with sparse/MoE designs (“activate only subsets of model parameters per input”), quantifying benefits (“reducing inference latency by 30–50%”) and acknowledging drawbacks (“challenges in load balancing across experts”), and names mitigation strategies (“gradient-guided gating or WDMoE-based distributed inference”).\n  - It further distinguishes dynamic attention mechanisms (“prune 60–80% of computations without accuracy loss”) and formalizes temporal/spatial locality biases with an attention equation—indicating rigor in articulating how architectural assumptions differ.\n  - It evaluates lightweight variants and compression (“4-bit precision with <1% accuracy drop,” “aggressive pruning … harms compositional reasoning”), explicitly articulating trade-offs between latency/efficiency and reasoning capacity.\n  - Hybrid models are differentiated by function (“RAG … grounds LLM outputs in 3GPP standards, reducing hallucination rates by 40%,” vs. “neuro-symbolic … rule-based validators for interpretable network diagnostics”), clearly stating advantages and intended use cases.\n- Contrasts pre-training strategies along data and objective axes:\n  - Section 2.2 separates tokenization/embedding (“hybrid approaches combining rule-based segmentation with learned embeddings”) from multimodal pre-training (“15–20% accuracy” improvement) and specialized self-supervised objectives (“masked network event prediction,” “contrastive learning for protocol alignment”), highlighting their domain fit and data efficiency (“reducing fine-tuning data requirements by 40%”).\n  - Challenges are identified and specific (“synthetic data generation … risks bias,” “6-bit quantization preserves performance”), mapping techniques to limitations.\n- Compares PEFT techniques by mechanism, assumptions, and resource/performance trade-offs:\n  - Section 2.3 contrasts LoRA (“only 0.1% of the parameters updated,” but “may limit … nonlinear patterns”), RLHF (“reducing manual validation efforts by 40%,” but “resource-intensive”), and prompt/adapters (“90% of full fine-tuning performance with just 2% additional parameters,” but “prompt sensitivity”), explicitly naming pros/cons and operational implications.\n  - It also notes compositional hybrids (LoRA + RLHF; PEFT + RAG), clarifying when combinations mitigate single-method limitations.\n- Deployment/scalability comparisons are practical and multi-dimensional:\n  - Section 2.4 contrasts distributed inference approaches (“WDMoE … partitions workloads across edge and cloud,” “InfMoE … sparse activation on single GPUs”) with energy-oriented methods (“dynamic batching and gradient checkpointing reduce power consumption by up to 40%,” “QA-LoRA … INT4 with <1% accuracy loss”).\n  - It flags system-level trade-offs (“adapter switching latency … mitigated through predictive loading”) and compares sparse fine-tuning vs. full-tuning performance regimes (“SpIEL … slower in low-data scenarios but outperform[s] LoRA by 12% when data exceeds 10k samples”), demonstrating nuanced, data-dependent evaluation.\n- Hybrid approaches are contrasted by capability and cost:\n  - Section 2.5 distinguishes RAG (“latency overheads from retrieval operations”), multimodal LLMs (“alignment challenges across heterogeneous data modalities”), and neuro-symbolic integration (“reduces manual configuration errors by 30%”), explaining how these methods differ in architecture, objectives (grounding vs. fusion vs. rule compliance), and assumptions about knowledge access and interpretability.\n\nWhere the comparison falls short of a perfect score:\n- While each subsection offers clear contrasts and trade-offs, there is no overarching comparative framework or taxonomy applied uniformly across methods (e.g., a consistent set of axes such as latency, accuracy, interpretability, data dependence, energy, and deployment footprint). The comparisons are thorough within subsections but not synthesized into a single, structured set of dimensions spanning all techniques.\n- Some areas remain more descriptive than comparative. For example:\n  - Section 2.2 lists multiple pre-training techniques and benefits but provides less direct, method-vs-method contrast on when to prefer masked event prediction vs. contrastive alignment beyond general statements (e.g., “These objectives enable few-shot adaptation, reducing fine-tuning data requirements by 40%,” and “risks bias” in synthetic data).\n  - Section 2.5 mentions “hybrid RAG architectures … combining dense and sparse retrievers” and “modality-specific experts” but does not deeply analyze selection criteria or boundary conditions (e.g., retrieval latency vs. accuracy curves, or when neuro-symbolic validation measurably outperforms pure RAG).\n- Cross-cutting comparisons (e.g., LoRA vs. adapters vs. pruning vs. quantization vs. MoE under identical telecom tasks and constraints) are implied across sections but not consolidated, which would elevate the analysis from strong narrative comparison to a systematic evaluation.\n\nOverall, the review demonstrates strong, technically grounded comparisons with explicit advantages, disadvantages, assumptions, and use-case alignment, especially in Sections 2.1, 2.3, and 2.4. It would reach a 5/5 with a unifying comparative schema applied across all methods and deeper, side-by-side analysis in areas like pre-training objectives and hybrid architectures beyond narrative contrasts.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\n\nOverall, the survey delivers meaningful, technically grounded critical analysis across core method families (architectures, pre-training, PEFT, deployment) and maps those choices to telecom-specific constraints (latency, edge resources, compliance). It goes beyond description by articulating trade-offs, limitations, and cross-cutting synergies. However, the depth is uneven: in several places, claims are insightful but not unpacked to the level of underlying mechanisms or explicit assumptions, and some comparative statements lack causal analysis. Below are specific strengths and gaps tied to concrete sections and sentences.\n\nWhere the paper provides strong, well-reasoned analysis\n\n- Section 2.1 (Transformer-Based Architectures)\n  - Explains efficiency-performance mechanisms and design trade-offs: “MoE architectures achieve linear computational cost reduction… However, these designs introduce challenges in load balancing across experts… necessitating techniques like gradient-guided gating” and “Dynamic attention mechanisms… prune 60–80% of computations without accuracy loss… temporal-spatial attention… align[s] with the time-sensitive nature of tasks.” This ties method behavior (sparse routing, locality biases) to telecom constraints (real-time, geo-temporal patterns) and provides a grounded equation for biased attention (A_ij … with φ and ψ).\n  - Notes harmful side-effects with a plausible causal hypothesis: “aggressive pruning of ‘redundant’ layers harms compositional reasoning in network configuration generation” (a nontrivial failure mode often overlooked in purely descriptive surveys).\n  - Synthesizes hybrid approaches to mitigate limitations: “Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)… grounds LLM outputs in 3GPP standards, reducing hallucination rates by 40% in technical documentation tasks,” and “Neuro-symbolic integration… with rule-based validators for interpretable network diagnostics.”\n\n- Section 2.2 (Telecom-Specific Pre-Training)\n  - Links tokenization/embeddings to domain structure: “Hybrid approaches… for protocol headers and signal measurements… hierarchical embeddings… capture temporal and spatial dependencies,” a technical rationale for why generic tokenizers underperform on telecom corpora.\n  - Analyzes objective selection in terms of telecom data properties: “Masked network event prediction… balances accuracy and computational efficiency,” and “Contrastive learning for protocol alignment… enables few-shot adaptation,” tying objectives to downstream data efficiency and alignment.\n  - Explicitly discusses risks and trade-offs: “Synthetic data generation… risks bias,” “quantization-aware pre-training… addresses memory overhead.”\n\n- Section 2.3 (PEFT)\n  - Offers mechanistic commentary: presents LoRA’s low-rank update formula and argues “LoRA’s reliance on linear projections may limit its ability to capture nonlinear telecom-specific patterns,” then contrasts with “LoRA-FA… freezing one of the low-rank matrices,” which is a concrete, technically grounded limitation/remedy pair.\n  - Evaluates RLHF beyond description: “requires carefully curated preference datasets and iterative reward modeling… resource-intensive,” and suggests “combining LoRA with RLHF… fine-tuning only the reward head’s low-rank layers,” an insightful synthesis under telecom compute constraints.\n  - Identifies sensitivity/failure modes: “suboptimal prompts can degrade performance,” pointing to initialization/meta-learning needs.\n\n- Section 2.4 (Scalability and Deployment)\n  - Connects system design to telecom SLAs: “WDMoE… partitions LLM workloads across edge and cloud… aligning with low-latency requirements”; “QA-LoRA… INT4 precision with <1% accuracy loss… on edge devices,” and “adapter switching latency… mitigated through predictive loading,” showing thoughtful reasoning across model, system, and traffic patterns.\n  - Compares sparse fine-tuning behavior under different data regimes: “SpIEL… converge[s] slower… in low-data scenarios but outperform[s] LoRA… when data exceeds 10k samples,” a useful, nuanced observation about data-dependent method selection.\n\n- Section 2.5 (Emerging/Hybrid)\n  - Balances benefit-cost analysis: “RAG… mitigates hallucination… [but] introduces latency… necessitating optimized indexing,” and in MM-LLMs: “alignment challenges across heterogeneous data modalities… leveraging cross-modal attention masks,” both pointing to cause-and-effect and design countermeasures.\n  - Addresses interpretability-design trade-offs: “Neuro-symbolic integration… validated by symbolic reasoners for compliance,” positioning hybrid systems as a principled response to black-box risks.\n\n- Section 3.1 (Telecom NLP)\n  - Identifies core ambiguities and how methods address them: “user queries often contain ambiguities… multi-task RL… optimizing for correctness and coherence,” and “RAG introduces latency… necessitating optimized vector databases and hierarchical indexing,” again connecting method limits to telecom responsiveness requirements.\n  - Notes edge deployment trade-offs: “pruning redundant transformer layers can accelerate inference… [but] over-aggressive pruning harms few-shot learning.”\n\n- Section 3.2 (Network Optimization)\n  - Links temporal reasoning and streaming to algorithm choice: “temporal reasoning challenges… attention mechanisms—enabling stable performance even in infinite sequence lengths,” and articulates MoE routing latency vs. hardware-aware optimizations.\n\n- Section 3.3 (Security)\n  - Moves beyond summary to attack surface and defenses: “prompt injection and data poisoning… mitigation strategies… differential privacy… [but] trade-off… detection sensitivity vs false positives… encrypted traffic,” and quantifies costs: “homomorphic encryption… 3–5× latency overhead.”\n\n- Sections 3.4–3.5 (Multimodality; Optimization)\n  - Provides fusion mechanics and compute constraints: gating-based fusion equation; “dynamic token pruning to reduce redundancy,” “4-bit quantized MM-LLMs… <100ms latency… ~5% drop,” and roofline analysis (“70% of inference latency attributed to memory access”), which is a strong, mechanistic explanation of bottlenecks.\n\n- Strengths in synthesis across research lines\n  - Recurring, well-connected themes: PEFT ↔ RAG ↔ neuro-symbolic integration ↔ federated/edge deployment appear across Sections 2–4, showing the authors recognize that no single method suffices under telecom constraints and offering composite solutions (e.g., LoRA + RLHF; RAG + 3GPP grounding; neuro-symbolic validation for compliance).\n\nWhere the analysis is uneven or underdeveloped\n\n- Limited articulation of underlying causes in places:\n  - Section 2.3: “LoRA’s reliance on linear projections may limit… nonlinear patterns” is plausible but not unpacked (e.g., where nonlinearity matters most in telecom tasks, or empirical signatures of failure in configuration synthesis).\n  - Section 2.5: “MM-LLMs… face alignment challenges” and “Hybrid retrievers… 2–3× faster” state outcomes but do not delve into failure mechanisms (e.g., modality gap, co-training instability, optimizer-induced collapse, or routing conflicts in MoE for mixed modalities).\n  - Section 3.2: “SpIEL… outperform[s] LoRA by 12%… when data exceeds 10k samples” is insightful but lacks explanation (e.g., sparsity structure aligning with richer supervision, or reduced interference vs. dense updates).\n\n- Assumptions and boundary conditions are often implicit:\n  - Real-time claims (URLLC, sub-100ms targets) appear in 3.4, 3.5, 4.5, but the survey rarely quantifies how specific algorithmic choices push latency below critical thresholds (e.g., mapping KV-cache savings, speculative decoding depth, or expert parallelism to end-to-end TTFT/TPS under telecom traffic bursts).\n  - Federated/non-IID effects are mentioned (2.5, 3.5, 6.2, 7.2) but not deeply analyzed (e.g., drift, personalization vs. global optimality, fairness impacts in cross-operator models).\n\n- Some cross-method contrasts stop short of mechanistic commentary:\n  - Semantic communication savings (e.g., 4.6 and 7.1): asserted benefits (“30–50% bandwidth reduction”) but limited causal analysis on where semantic compression holds under noisy channels, misalignment risks, or how RAG/neuro-symbolic components constrain hallucination in control loops.\n  - Robustness in multi-modal security (3.3, 4.3): good identification of attack vectors, but less discussion of root causes inside LLMs (e.g., attention hijacking patterns, instruction-following priors, or gradient alignment that amplifies injections).\n\nWhy this merits a 4 and not a 5\n\n- The paper consistently identifies design trade-offs and ties them to telecom constraints, offering multi-method syntheses and occasionally formalizations (2.1, 3.4). This is substantively beyond descriptive summary.\n- However, in several high-impact areas (federated non-IID learning, MM-LLM alignment mechanics, detailed latency budgets, failure modes in sparse routing and speculative decoding), the analysis remains at a high level. Explanations of fundamental causes are present but uneven, with several claims that would benefit from deeper mechanistic or empirical rationale.\n\nSuggestions to strengthen the critical analysis (research guidance value)\n\n- Make assumptions explicit and tie them to telecom KPIs:\n  - For each method family (MoE, quantization, speculative decoding, RAG), specify latency/throughput/energy budgets and show how design choices map to TTFT/TPS and URLLC targets under realistic load.\n- Deepen causal analysis of known failure modes:\n  - MM-LLM alignment: discuss modality gap, optimization instability, and strategies (e.g., contrastive pretraining schedules, temperature scaling, router regularization) that address them.\n  - Sparse/PEFT vs full tuning: explain when sparse updates underperform (e.g., highly entangled tasks like protocol synthesis) and why data scale or structure reverses the advantage.\n- Analyze federated non-IID effects:\n  - Detail convergence issues, personalization-vs-generalization tensions, and fairness drift across operators; relate to adapter specialization vs. shared base dynamics.\n- Contrast retrieval and closed-book modes with error taxonomies:\n  - Provide a decision framework for when RAG reduces hallucination without violating latency, including cache policies, index refresh strategies, and fallback behaviors under retrieval failure.\n- Connect architectural choices to hardware constraints:\n  - Map KV-cache, attention variants (linear/KV-sinks), and MoE routing to specific accelerator memory hierarchies (HBM/flash), quantifying expected gains and contention under telecom burstiness.\n\nIn summary, the survey demonstrates notable analytical depth and cross-method synthesis in many places (especially Sections 2.1–2.5 and 3.1–3.5), but the depth is inconsistent, with some claims lacking mechanistic underpinnings or explicit boundary conditions. This supports a score of 4 for critical analysis quality.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe review identifies research gaps comprehensively across data, methods, deployment, evaluation, and ethics, and frequently connects them to telecom-specific constraints (latency, energy, privacy, compliance). However, while the coverage is broad, the analysis is often brief and fragmented, with many gaps listed without sustained, deep exploration of their root causes or quantified impact. This aligns with a score of 4: thorough identification but only moderate depth of analysis.\n\nEvidence supporting the score:\n\n- Data and pre-training gaps:\n  - Section 2.2 (Telecom-Specific Pre-Training Strategies), “Challenges and Future Directions”: Identifies “data scarcity and energy efficiency,” risks of synthetic data bias, and calls for “federated pre-training… and neuro-symbolic integration,” tying them to privacy and memory constraints. This shows awareness of data-related gaps, though impact analysis is succinct.\n  - Section 3.4 (Multimodal Data Integration), “Future directions must address… unified evaluation benchmarks,” notes the deficiency of standardized multimodal evaluation in telecom.\n\n- Methodological gaps (architectures, efficiency, PEFT):\n  - Section 2.3 (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning), conclusion: Lists future directions such as “dynamic rank allocation for LoRA, federated RLHF,” but offers limited analysis of why these matter or their potential systemic impact in telecom beyond efficiency.\n  - Section 2.4 (Scalability and Deployment Considerations): “Challenges persist in balancing specialization and generalization… Future directions include adaptive compute-offloading… telecom-specific scaling laws.” This ties methods to deployment constraints and articulates their importance for latency and scaling, though still at a high level.\n  - Section 2.5 (Emerging Architectures and Hybrid Approaches): Notes “challenges in balancing model sparsity and accuracy,” and suggests “adaptive architectures… semantic communication,” connecting method choices to efficiency and accuracy trade-offs.\n\n- Security and robustness gaps:\n  - Section 3.3 (Security and Anomaly Detection): Explicitly states “three critical gaps” including “dynamic adversarial training pipelines,” “lightweight, quantized LLMs… for edge,” and “neuro-symbolic reasoning,” with rationale tied to evolving threats and resource constraints. Impact is mentioned (false positives, latency), but deeper causal or quantitative analysis is limited.\n  - Section 5.3 (Robustness and Scalability Testing): Highlights vulnerabilities such as “prompt injection,” MoE training issues (“multi-epoch degradation”), and the open challenge of “sub-100ms latency,” then proposes directions like neuro-symbolic reasoning and federated collaboration. Good identification; impact discussion is present but brief.\n\n- Evaluation and benchmarking gaps:\n  - Section 5.1 (Standardized Evaluation Frameworks): Clearly articulates gaps: “lack of unified metrics for cross-modal tasks,” “insufficient attention to energy efficiency,” and “limited benchmarks for continual learning.” It explains why these matter (e.g., dynamic network conditions, energy costs), demonstrating telecom-specific evaluation needs.\n  - Section 5.2 (Comparative Analysis): Contrasts LLMs with traditional algorithms, pointing to robustness and energy-efficiency deficits (e.g., “1.58-bit quantized LLMs… trail optimized C++ implementations… in TOPS/Watt”), and highlighting practical deployment implications.\n\n- Ethical, fairness, regulatory gaps:\n  - Section 5.4 (Ethical and Fairness Considerations): Identifies “dynamic fairness adaptation,” “energy-efficient auditing,” and “cross-border harmonization,” and explains impacts (e.g., multilingual disparities, auditability constraints). The analysis is more thematic than deeply diagnostic.\n  - Section 6.2 (Data Privacy and Security Risks): Frames trade-offs in federated learning and differential privacy and connects them to telecom’s latency and accuracy needs; proposes hybrid solutions (federated fine-tuning with LoRA), yet does not deeply quantify impacts.\n  - Section 6.4 (Regulatory and Interoperability Challenges): Enumerates future directions (standardized APIs/benchmarks, privacy-preserving training, dynamic compliance engines), linking them to real-time constraints and multi-stakeholder needs.\n\n- Future directions synthesizing gaps:\n  - Section 7.1 (Integration with Next-Generation Networks): Ties gaps to 6G needs (“quadratic complexity of transformer attention,” “ethical risks, including bias”), with impacts on URLLC and semantic communication; analysis is clear but high level.\n  - Section 7.2 (Privacy-Preserving and Federated Learning): Lists “three key challenges” (non-IID distributions, secure aggregation latency, continual updates) and proposes method-level solutions; reasons are sound, impact is suggested but not deeply explored.\n  - Section 7.3 (Multimodal and Cross-Domain LLM Applications): Identifies “scalability and modality imbalance” and bias in multimodal datasets; connects to telecom tasks (QoS, anomaly detection); impact discussion is concise.\n  - Section 7.4 (Scalability and Efficiency Challenges): Addresses trade-offs (model size, energy, latency), references QA-LoRA, WDMoE, and LoRAX; articulates importance for edge deployments and sustainable operations.\n\nWhy this is not a 5:\n- Fragmentation and brevity: Many “Challenges/Future directions” subsections list gaps but do not consistently provide deep causal analysis or quantify impacts (e.g., how specific gaps affect KPIs like TTFT, TPS, QoS, or regulatory non-compliance rates).\n- Limited synthesis: While gaps are covered across sections, there is limited integrative framing that prioritizes gaps or maps them to a coherent research agenda with clear impact pathways.\n- Occasional generality: Some future work items (e.g., “neuro-symbolic integration,” “adaptive architectures”) recur without detailed justification tailored to telecom subdomains.\n\nOverall, the review excels at identifying a wide range of relevant gaps and connecting them to telecom constraints, but the analysis tends to remain at a broad level rather than offering deep, prioritized, and impact-focused exploration. Hence, a score of 4 is appropriate.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe paper proposes numerous forward-looking research directions that are well grounded in identified gaps and real-world telecom needs, and it offers several specific, innovative topics and suggestions. However, while the directions are relevant and often actionable, the analysis of academic and practical impact is generally brief and dispersed, without consistently deep exploration of the causes or implications of the gaps. This aligns best with the 4-point criterion.\n\nEvidence from specific sections and sentences:\n\nStrengths: Clear identification of gaps tied to real-world constraints and actionable future directions\n- 2.4 Scalability and Deployment Considerations explicitly connects deployment constraints to telecom realities and proposes concrete solutions: “Future directions include adaptive compute-offloading, where LLM submodules are dynamically partitioned between edge and cloud based on network congestion, and the development of telecom-specific scaling laws to optimize model size for downstream tasks [50].” This is both forward-looking and directly responsive to low-latency, resource-constrained environments.\n- 3.4 Multimodal Data Integration identifies domain-specific gaps and offers targeted directions: “Future directions must address three unresolved challenges… (1) Dynamic modality weighting… (2) Federated multimodal learning… (3) Unified evaluation benchmarks [26].” These address multimodal alignment and privacy needs in real telecom operations.\n- 5.5 Emerging Trends and Future Directions in Benchmarking frames evaluation needs around federated and efficiency-centric benchmarking for telecom workloads: “Future directions must address three key challenges: (1) Standardization… (2) Dynamic adaptation… (3) Generalization.” This is closely aligned with operational needs and reproducibility.\n- 6.4 Regulatory and Interoperability Challenges proposes actionable priorities that map directly to real-world compliance barriers: “Three research priorities stand out: 1) Standardized APIs and Benchmarks… 2) Privacy-Preserving Training… 3) Dynamic Compliance Engines…”\n- 7.2 Privacy-Preserving and Federated Learning Paradigms outlines specific, technically novel directions: “Future directions should explore: (1) lightweight homomorphic encryption for transformer attention layers… (2) cross-silo FL architectures… (3) federated reinforcement learning…,” which directly serve GDPR and data sovereignty constraints in telecom.\n- 7.4 Scalability and Efficiency Challenges shows clear actionability for deployment: “Future research must address unresolved challenges, including the scalability of federated learning… development of lightweight, multimodal LLMs for edge deployment… innovations in adaptive resource allocation, such as LLM-driven dynamic batching…”\n- 7.5 Regulatory and Ethical Frameworks identifies operationally relevant future research: “Future research must address three critical gaps: (1) developing lightweight, real-time bias detection tools… (2) standardizing cross-border regulatory sandboxes… (3) advancing energy-efficient adversarial robustness techniques…” These are practical, measurable, and aligned with telecom policy and compliance needs.\n- 7.6 Emerging Research Directions articulates higher-level strategic tensions and pathways: “Future research must reconcile three tensions: autonomy versus determinism, evaluation breadth versus practicality, and multimodal richness versus efficiency,” and suggests concrete next steps like “neuro-symbolic integration… federated benchmarking initiatives… advances in sparsity-aware training.”\n\nInnovation and specificity:\n- The survey consistently proposes advanced, specific directions such as “telecom-specific scaling laws” (2.4), “dynamic modality weighting” (3.4), “federated RLHF” (2.3, implied by “federated RLHF for privacy-preserving alignment”), “MatMul-free models” for real-time constraints (3.2: “innovations like [68] propose eliminating matrix multiplications entirely”), and “semantic communication” leveraging LLMs to transmit meaning, reducing bandwidth (3.6; 7.1).\n- It offers implementable ideas like standardized telecom benchmarks (TeleQnA [26], TSpec-LLM [90]), “Dynamic compliance engines” (6.4), “adaptive compute-offloading” (2.4), “lightweight homomorphic encryption for attention” (7.2), and “LLM-driven dynamic batching” (7.4).\n\nLinkage to real-world needs:\n- Multiple sections explicitly anchor directions to telecom constraints: URLLC latency and mMTC in 6G (7.1), GDPR/data sovereignty (6.2; 7.2), edge resource constraints (2.1; 2.4; 7.4), and standard-compliant outputs via RAG with 3GPP (2.5; 3.6; 4.4; 5.1; 7.5).\n- Examples of quantified impacts that show practical relevance, though not always in future directions, appear in earlier sections and inform the proposed directions (e.g., “30% bandwidth savings” via semantic communication [3.6], “sub-100ms decision cycles” for 6G [4.5], and “<100ms latency” for multimodal models at edge [3.4]).\n\nLimitations preventing a 5-point score:\n- The analysis of academic vs practical impact is often concise and not deeply elaborated. For example, while 7.2 proposes “lightweight homomorphic encryption for transformer attention layers,” it does not discuss feasibility trade-offs (compute overhead vs privacy guarantees) in depth.\n- Several future directions are presented as lists of promising avenues without full exploration of the underlying causes of the gaps or step-by-step pathways to resolution. For instance, 7.3’s “dynamic adaptation and federated learning” recommendations and 7.6’s tensions could benefit from more detailed methodological blueprints or evaluation protocols.\n- Some directions remain broad or high-level (e.g., 7.1’s “address scalability bottlenecks… ethical risks…”; 7.6’s “interdisciplinary collaboration”) and lack the “clear and actionable path” detail required for a 5-point rating across the entire future work scope.\n\nOverall, the survey excels in identifying and proposing forward-looking, innovative directions that address genuine telecom needs and constraints across privacy, latency, scalability, multimodality, and compliance. It falls short of a perfect score primarily due to the relative brevity of impact analyses and limited depth on implementation pathways for some proposed directions."]}
