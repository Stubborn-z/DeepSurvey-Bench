{"name": "x2", "paperour": [4, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4], "reason": ["Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\n\nOverall assessment\n- The paper’s Abstract and Introduction articulate a clear, survey-style objective focused on LLMs in telecommunications, with an explicit scope (5G/6G, wireless networks, edge deployment) and a stated intent to cover principles, techniques, challenges, and opportunities. The background and motivation are largely sufficient and multi-faceted, and the practical significance is evident. However, the objectives are broad and sometimes diffuse, with some undefined terms (e.g., “wBAIMs”) and missing figure references (“as shown in .”), and the claimed “knowledge gaps” (especially in instruction tuning for telecom) are not concretely specified. These issues prevent a top score.\n\nEvidence supporting Research Objective Clarity\n- Abstract: “This survey paper systematically analyzes the transformative impact of LLMs, focusing on foundational principles, key techniques, and future opportunities for integrating artificial intelligence into telecommunications.” This sentence clearly states the survey’s analytical focus and breadth.\n- Abstract: “It explores the adaptation of LLMs to meet the unique challenges of wireless communication networks, particularly in 5G and emerging 6G technologies, addressing knowledge gaps in instruction tuning crucial for optimizing LLM applications.” This specifies a central angle (wireless/5G–6G) and emphasizes instruction tuning as a focal gap.\n- Objectives of the Survey: “This survey aims to systematically analyze the transformative impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) on the telecommunications industry, focusing on key techniques for effective implementation and future research opportunities.” Clear statement of purpose for a survey.\n- Objectives of the Survey: “It reviews the adaptation of LLMs to address the unique challenges of wireless communication networks… seeks to fill knowledge gaps in instruction tuning… provides insights into the design, deployment, and evaluation of wireless BAIMs (wBAIMs) within 6G networks, intentionally excluding unrelated AI models…” These sentences establish explicit sub-goals and scope boundaries (wireless domain, 6G, exclusion of non-wireless models), which aid clarity.\n- Structure of the Survey: Lays out a logical roadmap—principles (pre-training, adaptation, evaluation), methodologies/datasets (instruction tuning), techniques (data processing, training, integration), opportunities, challenges, and future directions. This supports directional clarity.\n\nGaps/ambiguities affecting Objective Clarity\n- “wBAIMs” is introduced without prior definition (“…design, deployment, and evaluation of wireless BAIMs (wBAIMs) within 6G networks…”), reducing precision.\n- The claim to address “knowledge gaps in instruction tuning” is not made concrete—no explicit sub-questions, taxonomies, or gap inventory are articulated in the Abstract/Introduction.\n- Missing figure references (“as shown in .” in Structure of the Survey and later sections) suggest incomplete presentation of the organizational logic that the text relies on.\n\nEvidence supporting Background and Motivation\n- Introduction—Significance of LLMs in Telecommunications: The text articulates several motivating factors:\n  - “The shift from statistical to neural language models has significantly improved performance… facilitating the integration of LLMs into cloud-native applications… essential for generating cloud configurations” (ties LLM capability evolution to telecom workflows).\n  - “The push for open and efficient foundation language models…” (motivates accessibility and research relevance).\n  - “In the context of 5G… LLMs are poised to support… remote healthcare and smart cities” (connects to telecom service contexts).\n  - “Instruction tuning (IT) is vital… Furthermore, the necessity of offloading complex tasks to edge servers is emphasized…” (highlights controllability and deployment constraints relevant to telecom).\n- Objectives of the Survey: Motivation for telecom-specific focus is bolstered by mentioning edge LLM deployment, multi-modal sensing, resource management, network slicing, and domain specificity (e.g., “technical specification comprehension,” “anomaly resolution”).\n\nWeaknesses in Background and Motivation\n- Some motivations are generic to AI/LLMs (e.g., “automate the design of reward functions… in robotics”) and only loosely tied back to telecom, which dilutes focus.\n- The gap analysis around instruction tuning, telecom-specific datasets/benchmarks, and concrete limitations of current LLMs for telecom tasks is not deeply articulated in the Abstract/Introduction (e.g., which instruction-tuning aspects—data schemas, alignment techniques, safety constraints—are missing for telecom?).\n\nEvidence supporting Practical Significance and Guidance Value\n- Abstract: “It also examines opportunities for AI in network optimization, customer service enhancement, predictive maintenance, and automation, while addressing challenges such as technical and operational barriers, ethical implications, and limitations in model performance.” This highlights clear practical domains and balanced coverage of opportunities and risks.\n- Objectives of the Survey: “provides insights into the design, deployment, and evaluation of [wBAIMs] within 6G networks… emphasizes democratizing access… tackles… multi-modal sensing data… provides… overview of resource management and network slicing… By focusing on edge LLM deployment… underscores the potential for LLMs to revolutionize telecommunications infrastructure and operations.” These statements convey tangible guidance targets (design/deployment insights, edge training/inference, resource management).\n- Structure of the Survey: Explicit plan to discuss implementation techniques (data processing, model training, system integration), challenges/limitations, and future directions—this is practical and useful for stakeholders.\n\nLimitations diminishing Guidance Value\n- The lack of a concise contributions list (e.g., “This survey contributes: 1) taxonomy…, 2) dataset/benchmark summary…, 3) gap analysis…, 4) open problems…”) hampers the reader’s ability to pinpoint actionable takeaways.\n- Undefined terms (e.g., “wBAIMs”) and missing figure references reduce the immediate guidance quality for practitioners.\n\nSummary rationale for the score\n- Strengths: Clear survey intent and scope (telecom/5G–6G focus, instruction tuning angle, edge deployment); adequate background linking LLM capabilities to telecom needs; practical significance delineated across multiple operational domains; a structured roadmap signaling guidance value.\n- Weaknesses: Objectives remain broad; some diffusion into general AI claims; lack of concrete gap definition; undefined acronyms and missing figure references; no crisp contributions list.\n\nGiven these factors, the section merits 4 points: the objectives are clear and valuable, with solid background and meaningful guidance potential, but the presentation lacks the precision and completeness required for a top score.", "Score: 3\n\nExplanation:\n- Method classification clarity: The paper presents several classification axes that are useful but not fully coherent as a unified taxonomy for telecom-specific methods.\n  - The clearest taxonomy appears in “Key Techniques for Implementing LLMs in Telecommunications,” which is organized along the model lifecycle: “Data Processing and Multi-modal Integration,” “Model Training and Optimization Strategies,” “System Integration and Deployment,” “Memory Optimization Techniques,” and “Self-Attention Mechanisms and Overfitting.” This division is reasonably clear and helps readers situate techniques by where they act in the pipeline. The subsections explicitly enumerate techniques (e.g., split learning for edge collaboration [8], QLoRA [59], ZeRO [60], intra-layer model parallelism [61]) and deployment frameworks (e.g., TeraPipe [56], NETBUDDY [55]).\n  - Earlier, “Principles of Large Language Models in Telecommunications” introduces two thematic categories: “Unified Text-to-Text Framework for NLP Tasks” and “Integration of Logical Reasoning and Mathematical Capabilities.” These collect prompting and reasoning techniques (e.g., prompt tuning [50], grammar prompting [19], chain-of-thought [46], AttendOut [48], multi-query attention/GQA [49]). While clear as technique groups, they are not tied to a telecom task taxonomy (e.g., RAN optimization, core network ops, OSS/BSS automation), making the classification feel more general-purpose than telecom-specific.\n  - The “Opportunities for AI in Telecommunications” section offers an application-oriented partition (“Network Optimization,” “Customer Service and User Interaction,” “Predictive Maintenance and Reliability,” “Automation and Efficiency”). This complements the lifecycle taxonomy but is not explicitly cross-referenced to it, so the mapping from techniques to application areas is left implicit.\n\n- Evolution of methodology: The paper mentions some historical and directional trends but does not systematically present an evolutionary path.\n  - The “Introduction Significance…” notes the “shift from statistical to neural language models” and the transition from 5G to 6G, as well as the move to open foundation models and edge offloading. However, these mentions are brief and not expanded into a stepwise evolution of methods or stages.\n  - Across sections, newer developments are named (e.g., instruction tuning/controllability, Chain-of-Thought [46], DRLHF [17]/DPO [75], parameter-efficient fine-tuning like QLoRA [59], edge/ split learning [8], RAG/prompt engineering in WirelessLLM [12,14]), but they are presented as a catalogue rather than a progression. There is no explicit chronology or staging (e.g., pretraining → fine-tuning → instruction tuning/RLHF → tool-use/RAG → multi-agent/agentic workflows → edge/efficient inference for telecom).\n  - The “Structure of the Survey” promises a flow “from foundational principles… to methodologies and dataset construction… to techniques… to opportunities… to challenges… to future directions,” which is a logical narrative, but within the core methodological sections the inheritance and connections between methods are not explicitly shown. For example, the paper does not explain how prompt tuning/grammar prompting evolved to address telecom-specific DSLs, or how edge split learning emerged in response to mobile constraints and how it changes the training/fine-tuning paradigm over time.\n  - Several places reference figures/tables that are not present (“As illustrated in ,” “Table …”), undermining the clarity of both classification and any intended evolutionary diagrams.\n\n- Specific points supporting the score:\n  - Clear classification examples:\n    - “Key Techniques for Implementing LLMs…” and its five subsections define a lifecycle-oriented taxonomy that is fairly clear and practical for deployment thinking.\n    - “Opportunities for AI in Telecommunications” organizes by application verticals (network optimization, customer service, predictive maintenance, automation), which reflects industry-facing groupings.\n  - Gaps in classification:\n    - “Unified Text-to-Text Framework for NLP Tasks” and “Integration of Logical Reasoning…” list many general LLM techniques (e.g., Zerocap [18], Meta-Transformer [41], AttendOut [48]) without consistently mapping them to telecom tasks or distinguishing telecom-unique adaptations, diluting the method taxonomy’s telecom specificity.\n    - Cross-domain methods (e.g., Zerocap image captioning; DF for website fingerprinting) are included alongside telecom items without an explicit taxonomy showing why they are relevant to telecom pipelines, which blurs categorization.\n  - Gaps in methodological evolution:\n    - The paper notes trends (“shift from statistical to neural…,” “edge offloading…,” “5G → 6G”) in the “Introduction” and “Future Directions,” but there is no systematic timeline or staged evolution explaining why and how methods changed, what bottlenecks prompted new techniques, or how telecom constraints shaped successive methodological innovations.\n    - The “Future Directions and Research Opportunities” section proposes refinements (e.g., automating grammar extraction [19], parameter-efficient tuning, expanding benchmarks like SPEC5G [5]) but does not tie them back to past stages and their limitations to show an evolutionary chain.\n\nOverall judgment:\n- The paper provides a partially clear set of method categories (especially the implementation lifecycle and application-oriented sections), but it mixes general LLM techniques with telecom applications without a unifying telecom-specific taxonomy and lacks an explicit, systematic evolution narrative. The result reflects some development trends but does not fully reveal the field’s progression or the inheritance between method families. Hence, a 3 is appropriate.", "2\n\nExplanation:\n- Diversity of datasets and metrics: The survey references datasets and metrics only at a very high level, with minimal specifics and few telecom-domain details. For example, in “Natural Language Processing (NLP)” it mentions “Comprehensive datasets, often comprising trillions of tokens, train large language models to perform complex tasks with high accuracy [23]” and “Metrics beyond mere accuracy ensure holistic evaluation of model capabilities and trade-offs [24],” but it does not name datasets, describe their scales, sources, modalities, or labeling methods. It similarly states “benchmarks specifically designed for the telecommunications domain” in “Interrelation of LLMs, NLP, and Telecommunications [40],” yet provides no concrete benchmark names, task definitions, or dataset characteristics. The one concrete benchmark described with any specificity is “benchmarks for Verilog code generation… emphasizing syntactic and functional testing” in “Unified Text-to-Text Framework for NLP Tasks [45],” which is peripheral to telecom and lacks details on dataset composition. Mentions of GLM-130B as a benchmark with “bilingual performance metrics” in “Opportunities for AI in Telecommunications [68]” and BERTScore in “Limitations in Model Performance and Evaluation” are brief and do not detail metric application or domain fit. Statements such as “Table provides a detailed examination of representative benchmarks…” and “Table offers a comparative overview…” appear multiple times (e.g., “Key Techniques for Implementing LLMs in Telecommunications” and “Limitations in Model Performance and Evaluation”), but the tables themselves are not present here and the narrative does not summarize their contents (no dataset names, sizes, splits, labels, or task definitions).\n- Rationality of datasets and metrics: The survey does include some reasonable metric considerations relevant to LLMs—e.g., “Metrics like Energy Cost and Inference Time clarify resource utilization during model inference [16]” in “Model Training and Optimization Strategies,” and mentions of alignment metrics such as “truthfulness and toxicity” in “Customer Service and User Interaction [54].” It also alludes to telecom performance outcomes (e.g., “lower delays and higher throughput for eMBB and URLLC slices” in “Predictive Maintenance and Reliability [35]”), but these are not framed as evaluation metrics for LLM experiments nor tied to specific datasets or experimental protocols. Crucially, the survey does not lay out telecom-appropriate datasets (e.g., RAN KPIs, NetFlow/PCAP traces, O-RAN xAPP logs, 3GPP protocol traces, UE mobility traces, beam management datasets) or describe their scales, labeling, and scenarios. Likewise, it does not systematically cover telecom-relevant metrics such as latency, throughput, packet loss, spectral efficiency, handover failure rate, slice SLA adherence, QoE measures, forecasting metrics (MSE/MAE/SMAPE), classification metrics (precision/recall/F1/AUC), or code generation evaluation (exact match, pass@k, functional correctness) in a way that links them to specific datasets and tasks. The few metric mentions (Energy/Inference time, cost efficiency in FrugalGPT [66], BERTScore, bilingual metrics in GLM-130B) are generic and not integrated into a consistent evaluation framework for telecom applications.\n- Supporting passages:\n  - “Comprehensive datasets, often comprising trillions of tokens, train large language models…” (NLP section) – generic scale reference without dataset names or telecom relevance.\n  - “Metrics beyond mere accuracy ensure holistic evaluation…” (NLP section) – vague, no metric list or application.\n  - “benchmarks specifically designed for the telecommunications domain” (Interrelation section [40]) – asserted but not detailed.\n  - “benchmarks for Verilog code generation… syntactic and functional testing…” (Unified Text-to-Text Framework [45]) – one concrete benchmark, but outside core telecom datasets; lacks dataset details.\n  - “Metrics like Energy Cost and Inference Time…” (Model Training and Optimization Strategies [16]) – useful but insufficient coverage.\n  - “GLM-130B… scalability and bilingual performance metrics” (Opportunities [68]) – brief, not telecom-specific.\n  - “Existing benchmarks like BERTScore may not encompass all aspects…” (Limitations) – metric named, but no broader metric framework provided.\n  - Multiple references to missing tables/figures: “Table provides a comparative overview…”, “Table provides a detailed examination…” – indicates intent but no accessible content in the provided text.\n\nGiven the absence of concrete dataset names, scales, labels, and application scenarios, and the limited, largely generic mention of metrics without telecom-specific coverage or rationalized selection, the section does not meet the criteria for comprehensive or even moderate coverage. Hence, a score of 2 is appropriate.", "Score: 2\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey compiles many methods and techniques relevant to LLMs in telecommunications, but it largely presents them as isolated items rather than as a systematic, multi-dimensional comparison. Across the sections after the Introduction (e.g., “Background and Definitions,” “Principles of Large Language Models in Telecommunications,” and “Key Techniques for Implementing LLMs in Telecommunications”), most discussions list methods with brief benefits, with limited explicit contrasting of architectures, objectives, assumptions, or trade-offs. Advantages and disadvantages are seldom juxtaposed across methods, and commonalities/distinctions are not synthesized into a coherent comparative framework.\n\nEvidence supporting this assessment:\n\n- Unified Text-to-Text Framework for NLP Tasks:\n  - The paper lists techniques without contrasting them across clear dimensions. For example: “Techniques such as prompt tuning adapt LLMs to telecom-specific language nuances, while grammar prompting improves text quality and relevance…”; “The FPT method supports versatile LLM deployment across modalities…”; “Collaborative frameworks, such as split learning systems (SLS-LLM)…,” “The Zerocap method…,” etc. These are descriptive mentions rather than a structured comparison of, for instance, prompt tuning vs. full fine-tuning vs. parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) in terms of data requirements, latency, robustness, or deployment constraints in telecom.\n\n- Integration of Logical Reasoning and Mathematical Capabilities:\n  - Several reasoning techniques are enumerated—“chain of thought prompting…,” “LM-Tutor…,” “GSM8K…,” “AttendOut…,” “Multi-query attention combined with multi-head attention…”—but there is no analysis of how these methods differ in assumptions (e.g., training-time vs. inference-time techniques), resource overhead, or suitability for telecom tasks with latency constraints. One partial comparative statement appears—“Prompt tuning emerges as a scalable approach that matches full model tuning performance as model size increases…”—but the survey does not expand this into a broader trade-off analysis (e.g., prompt tuning vs. adapters vs. LoRA vs. full fine-tuning across stability, catastrophic forgetting, or domain adaptation in telecom settings).\n\n- Data Processing and Multi-modal Integration:\n  - Again, methods are listed (Meta-Transformer, DF method, Zerocap, split learning, grammar prompting), but the survey does not contrast, for example, Meta-Transformer’s shared token space mapping vs. retrieval-augmented approaches or early/late fusion strategies, nor does it unpack their assumptions, data pairing requirements, or performance trade-offs in telecom-specific multimodal use cases.\n\n- Model Training and Optimization Strategies:\n  - The text notes “fine-tuning models using human feedback,” “interactive prompting,” “Chain of Thought prompting,” and mentions “metrics like Energy Cost and Inference Time,” but it does not systematically compare optimization paradigms (SFT, RLHF, DPO) across alignment stability, data demands, operational risk, or deployment cost in telecom. Claims such as “Chain of Thought prompting offers a structured approach…” are not contrasted with alternatives (e.g., self-consistency, Tree of Thought, program-of-thought) in a structured way.\n\n- System Integration and Deployment:\n  - The section mentions “NETBUDDY,” “TeraPipe,” and “UKM-DRL,” but there is no side-by-side comparison of deployment frameworks (e.g., pipeline-parallel training like TeraPipe vs. optimizer approaches like ZeRO vs. tensor/pipeline parallelism) concerning throughput, memory footprint, or communication overhead in telecom deployment contexts. Similarly, split learning is introduced elsewhere without comparing it to federated learning, on-device quantization/distillation, or edge offloading approaches under telecom latency and connectivity constraints.\n\n- Memory Optimization Techniques:\n  - Several techniques are noted—“ALBERT,” “QLoRA,” “ZeRO,” “Intra-layer model parallelism (ILMP)”—but their trade-offs are not compared (e.g., quantization accuracy vs. latency; ZeRO’s communication overhead vs. memory savings; parameter sharing vs. distillation; per-token latency impacts). The section summarizes individual benefits rather than contrasting them across consistent dimensions (memory savings, compute, accuracy impact, ease of integration, telecom deployment constraints).\n\n- Self-Attention Mechanisms and Overfitting:\n  - The section cites “AttendOut,” “Plan-and-Solve,” and high-level issues like “exponential degeneration of output rank,” but does not contrast attention variants (e.g., MQA vs. GQA vs. MHA) in terms of throughput, KV cache memory, or latency trade-offs—particularly important for telecom edge settings.\n\n- Challenges and Limitations; Limitations in Model Performance and Evaluation:\n  - These sections identify generic challenges (e.g., dependency on edge connectivity; specialized grammar creation; domain-specific pretraining needs) but do not tie them back to comparative evaluations of methods that address these challenges differently, nor do they provide a cross-method synthesis of pros/cons.\n\nOverall, while the survey is expansive and cites many methods, it falls short of a structured, technically grounded comparison across multiple meaningful dimensions (e.g., learning strategy, data dependency, scalability, latency/compute trade-offs, privacy, robustness) tailored to telecom applications. It mainly lists methods and attributes benefits in isolation, with minimal direct comparisons, limited treatment of disadvantages, and scarce discussion of underlying assumptions or architectural differences. Hence, a score of 2 is appropriate.", "Score: 3\n\nDetailed explanation:\nOverall, the section between the Introduction and later parts (notably “Background and Definitions,” “Interrelation of LLMs, NLP, and Telecommunications,” “Principles of Large Language Models in Telecommunications,” and “Key Techniques for Implementing LLMs in Telecommunications”) demonstrates basic analytical comments and some technically grounded observations, but the treatment is largely descriptive and lacks sustained reasoning about underlying mechanisms, design trade-offs, and assumptions across methods. There are occasional insightful statements (e.g., about self-attention biases and edge constraints), yet they are not developed into deeper comparative analyses. Below are concrete examples:\n\n1) Mostly descriptive listing without causal explanations or trade-offs\n- In “Unified Text-to-Text Framework for NLP Tasks,” methods are enumerated (prompt tuning, grammar prompting, FPT, Meta-Transformer, split learning), but the paper does not explain why one would prefer prompt tuning over full fine-tuning in telecom settings beyond a high-level resource rationale. For example: “Prompt tuning emerges as a scalable approach that matches full model tuning performance as model size increases, reducing resource requirements…” (Integration of Logical Reasoning and Mathematical Capabilities). There is no discussion of when/why this holds (e.g., sensitivity to task complexity, stability, or domain shift), what is lost vs. gained (catastrophic forgetting avoidance vs. limited task transfer), or telecom-specific constraints that might alter this trade-off.\n- Similarly, in “System Integration and Deployment,” TeraPipe is cited for “a 5.0x speedup” but without explaining the underlying mechanism (pipeline parallelism and schedule design), the bubble/throughput trade-offs, communication overheads, or how such techniques compare to tensor/sequence parallelism in telecom deployments.\n\n2) Limited technical causality despite naming mechanisms\n- “Self-Attention Mechanisms and Overfitting” briefly notes “self-attention networks… exhibit uniformity bias across tokens” and “exponential degeneration of output rank.” While these are technical insights, the paper stops short of explaining the mechanisms that cause rank degeneration, or how mitigation methods (e.g., AttendOut) change the learning dynamics, at what computational cost, and with what downstream impact on telecom workloads (e.g., long-context logs, streaming telemetry).\n- The attention-efficiency discussion (“Multi-query attention… GQA… improving efficiency”) is not accompanied by analysis of accuracy-latency-memory trade-offs (e.g., cache sharing benefits vs. potential quality regressions in long-context or multilingual settings), which are critical for telecom inference at the edge.\n\n3) Memory and efficiency techniques: listed but not compared systematically\n- “Memory Optimization Techniques” names ALBERT (“parameter sharing and factorized embedding”), QLoRA (“4-bit quantization plus LoRA”), ZeRO, and intra-layer model parallelism. While mechanisms are stated, the section does not probe the assumptions and limitations:\n  - ALBERT: no discussion of representation bottlenecks or when parameter sharing degrades performance on domain-specific tasks.\n  - QLoRA: no analysis of quantization-induced regressions in long-context or code-heavy tasks, calibration/outlier handling, or trade-offs between bit-width and QoS in telecom tasks.\n  - ZeRO: described as enabling larger training “without complex parallelism,” which glosses over the fact that ZeRO is itself a nuanced parallelism/memory-partitioning technique with communication and implementation complexity; no contrast to FSDP/DeepSpeed variants or their suitability under telecom infrastructure constraints.\n  - Absent is a decision framework (e.g., when to prefer quantization vs. parameter sharing vs. optimizer state partitioning for specific telecom workloads and latency budgets).\n\n4) Edge/telecom integration: high-level points without analytical depth\n- “Split learning systems enhance LLM performance in 6G networks by facilitating collaboration between mobile devices and edge servers” (Data Processing and Multi-modal Integration) and “dependency on edge server connectivity” (Technical Challenges) highlight relevant constraints, but do not analyze privacy-utility-latency trade-offs, communication overheads, failure modes under poor connectivity, or scheduler design for fluctuating radio conditions—key telecom-specific assumptions and trade-offs.\n- “Interrelation of LLMs, NLP, and Telecommunications” asserts synergy and categorization frameworks but does not synthesize how different adaptation strategies (e.g., RAG vs. instruction tuning vs. domain-specific pretraining vs. code-generation tool-use) compare under telecom data assumptions (proprietary standards, long-tail terminology, strict latency/availability SLAs).\n\n5) Limited cross-method synthesis and causal interpretation\n- Across sections (e.g., “Principles of LLMs in Telecommunications,” “Key Techniques…,” “Telecommunications Technology”), the narrative frequently uses bridging phrases (“These methodologies represent…,” “This integration highlights…”) but does not connect underlying mechanisms across research lines. For example, there is no explicit comparison of instruction tuning vs. retrieval-augmented generation for telecom knowledge grounding, nor a discussion of when fine-tuning is preferable to tool-mediated approaches (e.g., NETBUDDY-like config validation) given risk, auditability, and drift.\n- The survey cites “metrics like Energy Cost and Inference Time clarify resource utilization” (Model Training and Optimization Strategies) but does not interpret trade-offs quantitatively or explain how these metrics govern architecture/method choice in real telecom deployments.\n\n6) Challenges/limitations and ethics: generic rather than diagnostic\n- “Technical Challenges” and “Operational Challenges” list obstacles (edge connectivity, grammar prompting complexity, data heterogeneity) without exploring fundamental causes (e.g., domain shift, DSL ambiguity, idiosyncratic standards) or assessing the effectiveness/limits of proposed mitigations (e.g., domain-specific grammars vs. program synthesis, validation pipelines, secure retrieval).\n- “Ethical and Social Implications” names frameworks like Constitutional AI and DPO, but stops short of analyzing how feedback quality/bias propagates in telecom-specific tasks (e.g., provisioning policies, prioritization decisions), or how standardization should reflect sectoral regulation and audit needs.\n\nWhere the paper provides some analytical value:\n- The mention of “uniformity bias” and “exponential degeneration of output rank” (Self-Attention Mechanisms and Overfitting) reflects awareness of deeper model behavior.\n- The consistent thread around memory/compute constraints at the edge and the role of techniques like quantization, adapters, and split learning shows a useful (if high-level) alignment of method families to telecom constraints.\n- The paper points to domain adaptation needs (e.g., grammar prompting for DSLs, domain-specific fine-tuning like WirelessLLM) and recognizes challenges in instruction tuning and evaluation, albeit without a deeper comparative framework.\n\nGiven the balance of strengths and shortcomings, the review’s critical analysis rises above purely descriptive reporting but remains relatively shallow and uneven across methods. It does not consistently explain fundamental causes, trade-offs, or assumptions, and lacks integrative comparisons that interpret relationships across research lines. Therefore, a score of 3 is appropriate.", "4\n\nExplanation:\n\nOverall assessment:\n- The paper identifies a broad set of research gaps and future work across data, methods, systems, evaluation, and ethics, and it often connects those gaps to telecom-specific contexts (5G/6G, O-RAN, ISATNs, network slicing, edge deployment). However, many items are presented as lists with limited depth on root causes, prioritization, and concrete downstream impact on telecom KPIs (e.g., latency, reliability, OPEX/CAPEX). Hence, while the coverage is comprehensive, the depth of analysis is uneven, which is why this section merits 4 rather than 5.\n\nWhere the paper clearly identifies gaps and discusses their importance/impact:\n\n- Data and benchmarks\n  - “Limitations in Model Performance and Evaluation” explicitly notes the need for high‑quality, domain‑tailored datasets and more adaptable evaluation frameworks: “A significant challenge is the specificity of training data… High-quality datasets tailored to telecommunications applications’ unique requirements are needed.” It also highlights multilingual generalization issues: “Reliance on specific languages and language pairs… may restrict LLMs’ generalizability across diverse linguistic contexts,” and calls for domain‑specific pretraining akin to biomedical NLP to improve performance. Impact: without proper data/benchmarks, models won’t generalize to telecom languages and standards, undermining deployment.\n  - “Future Directions and Research Opportunities → Refinement and Optimization Techniques” calls for developing broader benchmarks, incorporating SPEC5G for protocol analysis to “reduce manual efforts,” and reducing inference energy costs—tying the gap to sustainability and practical toolability.\n\n- Methods and training\n  - “Future Directions and Research Opportunities → Refinement and Optimization Techniques” identifies method-level gaps: automating grammar extraction for complex DSLs, improving preference collection efficiency (DRLHP), stronger verifiers, parameter‑efficient fine‑tuning, prompt engineering, and optimized model parallelism. The rationale is provided (e.g., DSL grammars improve code robustness in network scenarios; efficient preference learning improves alignment).\n  - “Memory Optimization Techniques” details quantization (QLoRA), ZeRO, ILMP, and energy measurement/reduction during training/inference as necessary to make large models feasible for telecom workloads at the edge. The implied impact is operational viability in resource‑constrained environments.\n  - “Self‑Attention Mechanisms and Overfitting” points to overfitting/degeneration issues in attention and proposes AttendOut and structured reasoning (Plan‑and‑Solve) to improve robustness—important for reliability in safety‑critical network operations.\n\n- Systems/integration and edge deployment\n  - “Challenges and Limitations → Technical Challenges” names the dependency on edge server connectivity: “dependency on edge server connectivity… limits performance in areas with poor network coverage,” directly tying a system constraint to user‑visible performance impact.\n  - “Future Directions and Research Opportunities → Scalability and Adaptability” and “Integration and Application Expansion” emphasize scalable architectures, model/inference parallelism, and edge offloading, connecting these to dynamic traffic and heterogeneous service demands (e.g., network slicing). Impact: better responsiveness and resilience under varying loads.\n  - “System Integration and Deployment” and references to TeraPipe/NETBUDDY identify gaps in validating LLM‑generated configurations and accelerating large‑scale training—critical for safe and timely deployment.\n\n- Evaluation and safety\n  - “Limitations in Model Performance and Evaluation” argues current metrics (e.g., BERTScore) and methods (FPT) may miss task‑specific performance aspects, advocating comprehensive evaluation across telecom tasks (terminology, taxonomy, continuity, robustness).\n  - “Ethical and Social Implications” and “Ethical Implications and Standardization” highlight transparency, bias, and the quality of human feedback (Constitutional AI, DPO), linking these to trustworthiness and fairness—key for telecom service delivery and regulatory compliance.\n\n- Domain‑specific application gaps\n  - “Objectives of the Survey” and “Future Directions…” stress instruction‑tuning gaps for telecom tasks, and the need to adapt LLMs to telecom languages (e.g., identifying 3GPP working groups) and to automate 5G protocol analysis (SPEC5G). The impact—reduced manual effort and improved operator efficiency—is stated.\n  - “Integration and Application Expansion” and “Emerging Trends and Collaborative Efforts” point to integrating LLMs into ISATNs and WirelessLLM for wireless domain knowledge alignment/fusion/evolution, with the goal of intent‑driven, self‑evolving networks—articulating strategic industry impact.\n\nWhere the section falls short in depth:\n\n- Many future‑work items are presented as catalogs (e.g., parameter‑efficient fine‑tuning, prompt engineering, model parallelism, edge collaboration) without deeper causal analysis of why current techniques fail in telecom, how to measure progress, or how these gaps map to concrete telecom KPIs (e.g., URLLC reliability, beam management latency, slice isolation).\n- Limited prioritization or risk analysis. For instance, the operational risks of hallucinations in configuration/code generation, and mitigation strategies (e.g., constrained decoding, formal verification, RAG over vetted KBs) are not deeply examined despite being alluded to (e.g., grammar prompting, NETBUDDY).\n- Data governance and regulatory constraints (privacy, lawful intercept, cross‑border data flows) are not analyzed beyond general bias/transparency themes, even though they critically impact dataset creation, training, and deployment in telecom environments.\n- The multilingual/terminology gap is mentioned, but there’s little detail on concrete dataset creation strategies (e.g., mining 3GPP specs/GSMA/ETSI corpora, handling version drift), or on robustness to noisy operational logs and multimodal telemetry.\n- While evaluation limitations are recognized, the paper stops short of proposing detailed telecom‑specific benchmark task suites with metrics tied to operational outcomes (e.g., mean time to resolution, configuration error rate, energy per inference at RAN/edge).\n\nSpecific supporting parts:\n\n- “Challenges and Limitations → Technical Challenges”: identifies edge connectivity dependency; pre‑trained model caption inaccuracies; DSL grammar burden; need for domain adaptation (WirelessLLM).

However, analyses are often high‑level, with limited depth on causal mechanisms, concrete metrics, and prioritization of impact, preventing a top score.", "Score: 4\n\nExplanation:\nThe paper clearly identifies concrete research gaps and real-world constraints and proposes multiple forward-looking directions that respond to these gaps. However, while the directions are generally well aligned with telecom needs and contain some specific, innovative topics, the analysis of their academic/practical impact and the implementation path is often brief and high-level, which keeps this from a top score.\n\nEvidence that gaps/real-world issues are identified:\n- Challenges and Limitations – Technical Challenges: “A critical issue is the dependency on edge server connectivity, which limits performance in areas with poor network coverage [8].” and “Developing specialized grammars for grammar prompting methods presents a significant hurdle, especially for complex domain-specific languages (DSLs) [19]…” These pinpoint deployment bottlenecks at the edge and domain adaptation burdens.\n- Challenges and Limitations – Operational Challenges: “Integrating LLMs with existing network architectures is complex, requiring substantial modifications to meet computational demands [2].” and “Real-time processing and rapid adaptation to dynamic network conditions further complicate operations… [10].” These map directly to real-world RAN/core constraints and latency requirements.\n- Challenges and Limitations – Ethical and Social Implications: “A key ethical issue is the transparency of AI decision-making processes… [74]” and “Reliance on human feedback… may introduce limitations due to feedback quality [75].” These frame responsible AI deployment needs in telecom.\n- Limitations in Model Performance and Evaluation: “A significant challenge is the specificity of training data… [52]” and “Reliance on specific languages… may restrict LLMs’ generalizability… [68].” These highlight domain transfer and multilingual needs typical in global operators.\n\nEvidence that forward-looking directions address these gaps and real-world needs:\n- Future Directions and Research Opportunities – Refinement and Optimization Techniques:\n  - “Automating grammar extraction and expanding methods to support diverse domain-specific languages (DSLs) can significantly improve LLM adaptability in networking contexts [19].” This is a concrete, novel direction aimed at reducing the DSL authoring burden for telecom command/config languages.\n  - “Incorporating diverse datasets, like SPEC5G, enhances LLM applicability in 5G protocol analysis, automating analysis and security… [5].” This ties LLM refinement to a real telecom task (protocol analysis) and suggests dataset-driven automation.\n  - “Fine-tuning LLMs for telecom-specific language improves identification of 3GPP standard working groups…” This is a specific application-level direction aligned with operator standards workflows.\n  - “Optimizing model parallelism and alternative architectures for training large models…” and “Developing benchmarks covering more models and tasks, and reducing energy costs in inference…” address resource and evaluation gaps (edge constraints, energy efficiency) identified earlier.\n- Scalability and Adaptability:\n  - “Implementing scalable architectures… Techniques like model parallelism and efficient inference strategies enable effective operation across distributed infrastructures… [78].” This directly responds to operational constraints and edge/cloud distribution.\n  - “Integrating LLMs with advanced network management frameworks… enabling task-specific code generation from natural language queries and addressing challenges like explainability, scalability, and privacy.” This maps to intent-based operations and practical operator needs (explainability, privacy).\n- Integration and Application Expansion:\n  - “Deploying LLMs in Intelligent Satellite Network Systems (ISATNs)… [41],” “LLM application expansion in network slicing… [10],” and “Integrating LLMs into edge computing environments… [8].” These are concrete domains with clear real-world value (global coverage, heterogeneous slices, edge inference).\n  - “Deploying LLMs in predictive maintenance applications… leveraging frameworks like Tree of Thought (ToT)… [79].” This ties a research technique to an operational KPI (uptime/downtime reduction).\n- Emerging Trends and Collaborative Efforts:\n  - “Developing open and efficient foundation models… [3]” and “Integrating LLMs into cloud-native applications, where they generate cloud configurations [2].” These directions support democratization and DevOps alignment in telecom.\n  - “Efficient Parallel Split Learning (EPSL)… integrating edge computing with parallel split learning [8].” Direct response to the earlier edge-connectivity and resource constraints.\n- Ethical Implications and Standardization:\n  - “Establishing ethical standards mitigates biases… Ensuring transparency… Frameworks like Constitutional AI… [74],” and “addressing the quality and bias of human feedback… [75].” These propose standardization and governance aligned with telecom compliance needs.\n\nInnovation and specificity:\n- The paper proposes specific, novel topics such as automating grammar extraction for telecom DSLs, SPEC5G-driven LLMs for 5G protocol analysis, natural-language-to-code for network management, and ISATN integrations. These are more actionable than generic calls for “more research.”\n- It also recommends concrete efficiency avenues (e.g., parameter-efficient fine-tuning, model parallelism, energy-aware inference), directly tied to edge/operational constraints.\n\nWhy not a 5:\n- The discussion of impact and feasibility is often brief. For example, while “automating grammar extraction” and “task-specific code generation” are promising, the paper does not delineate concrete methodologies, validation protocols, or risk mitigation (e.g., safety guardrails for auto-generated network changes, human-in-the-loop workflows).\n- Prioritization and quantitative KPIs are missing; directions are numerous but not ranked by operator value or difficulty. Ethical standardization suggestions are general (transparency, bias mitigation) without telecom-specific standards mapping (e.g., 3GPP/ETSI/O-RAN processes).\n- Several directions (prompt engineering, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, benchmark expansion) are well-known in generic LLM literature; the paper could better articulate telecom-specific novelty and pathways to deployment.\n\nOverall, the section convincingly links gaps to forward-looking, real-world-relevant research directions, with several specific and innovative topics. The limited depth in impact analysis and implementation detail prevents a perfect score."]}
