{"name": "x1", "paperour": [4, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4], "reason": ["Score: 4/5\n\nExplanation:\n- Research Objective Clarity\n  - Strengths: The Abstract clearly states the paper’s purpose as a comprehensive survey of how LLMs can transform telecommunications, including “principles, key techniques, and opportunities.” It specifies the technical scope (“transfer learning, prompt engineering, model architectures, reinforcement learning, and energy efficiency”) and the application scope (“network optimization, customer service automation, predictive maintenance, and enhanced communication services”). This establishes a coherent, field-relevant objective aligned with contemporary telecom challenges and 6G integration.\n  - Supporting text: Abstract: “This survey paper … explores the transformative role of LLMs in the telecommunications sector… delves into fundamental principles, advanced techniques… Key applications include network optimization, customer service automation, predictive maintenance… Emerging use cases and challenges such as privacy… computational demands… model scalability are addressed, alongside future research directions…”\n  - Weaknesses: The section “Objectives of the Paper” dilutes clarity by presenting an overly long, heterogeneous list that mixes the survey’s aims with contributions and findings from disparate prior works, some only tangentially related to LLMs for telecom (e.g., “code smells and refactoring,” “[APR] MMAPR,” “tutoring mechanism,” PAC analysis of in-context learning, HDL code generation). Several sentences imply the survey itself introduces or proposes methods developed elsewhere (e.g., “The primary innovation of MMAPR…,” “The survey proposes a PAC-based framework…,” “The survey proposes a new method, InstructGPT…”), which confuses the survey’s objective with literature it reviews. This ambiguity weakens objective specificity.\n  - Supporting text: Objectives of the Paper: “The primary innovation of MMAPR…,” “The survey proposes a PAC-based framework…,” “The survey proposes a new method, InstructGPT…,” “it identifies known aspects of code smells and refactoring…” These read as contributions of individual prior works rather than the survey’s own objectives, making the objective statement diffuse.\n\n- Background and Motivation\n  - Strengths: The “Introduction – Growing Importance of LLMs in Telecommunications” and “Motivation for the Survey” provide rich context: the shift toward connected intelligence and 6G (“seamless interconnectivity…”), practical telecom tasks (network design analysis, anomaly resolution), constraints (energy costs of inference, model deployment on mobile devices, edge collaboration), and privacy/security issues. Together, they substantiate why a telecom-focused LLM survey is timely and necessary.\n  - Supporting text: Introduction: “The evolution of wireless networks is gravitating toward connected intelligence…,” “LLMs optimize data transmission for real-time applications…,” “The growing popularity of LLMs also presents computational challenges… energy costs of inference…,” “deployment in 6G networks enhances AI assistant services…” Motivation for the Survey: “Traditional methods have not effectively leveraged LLMs…,” “limitations of mobile devices in running local LLMs and the necessity for collaboration with edge servers…,” “the urgent need for improved protective measures… privacy protection…”\n  - Weaknesses: Some motivation elements are peripheral or insufficiently tied back to the core survey focus on LLMs for telecom (e.g., Tor website fingerprinting), and the breadth of examples occasionally feels scattershot. While they underscore relevance, tighter linkage of each motivation point to concrete LLM-for-telecom needs would improve coherence.\n\n- Practical Significance and Guidance Value\n  - Strengths: The Abstract and Introduction repeatedly emphasize practical telecom impact: integration into 6G, optimization of network operations, automation of customer support, predictive maintenance, edge deployment strategies, ISATNs, and intent-driven/self-evolving networks. The “Structure of the Survey” section promises coverage of methods directly actionable for telecom practitioners (transfer/fine-tuning, prompt engineering, energy/computation optimization), plus domain adaptation and standard-related tasks (e.g., 3GPP working group identification, SPEC5G).\n  - Supporting text: Abstract: “The survey highlights the potential of LLMs to revolutionize telecommunications… particularly with the anticipated integration into 6G networks.” Introduction/Structure: “Fine-tuning models … to understand telecom-specific language… paves the way for intent-driven, self-evolving wireless networks…,” “LLM deployment at the 6G edge… end-edge cooperation… improve response times and privacy…,” “SPEC5G… facilitating the automation of 5G protocol analysis…”\n  - Weaknesses: The practical value is strong, but the Objectives section’s conflation of reviewed contributions with survey contributions makes it harder to discern what concrete guidance or unique synthesis this survey itself provides beyond broad coverage. A crisper statement of the survey’s unique value (e.g., a taxonomy specific to telecom LLM techniques, a deployment reference architecture for 6G edge, a curated evaluation framework/dataset mapping) would strengthen guidance.\n\nWhy not 5/5:\n- While the Abstract and the introductory background/motivation are comprehensive and field-relevant, the “Objectives of the Paper” section undermines objective clarity by listing numerous, sometimes tangential items and by wording that blurs literature coverage with the survey’s own aims/contributions. This reduces specificity and coherence of the stated objectives.\n\nSuggestions to reach 5/5:\n- Consolidate the objectives into 3–5 precise bullets that are strictly the survey’s own goals, for example:\n  - Provide a telecom-specific taxonomy of LLM techniques (pre-training, adaptation, prompting, RL, efficiency) mapped to 5G/6G use cases.\n  - Systematically evaluate deployment patterns (device/edge/cloud), energy/latency trade-offs, and privacy risks for telecom scenarios.\n  - Synthesize domain adaptation strategies for telecom corpora (e.g., 3GPP, logs), including benchmarks and evaluation protocols (e.g., SPEC5G).\n  - Identify gaps and prioritized research directions for multimodal and agentic LLMs in RAN/core/OSS/BSS contexts and ISATNs.\n- Rephrase references to prior works’ contributions as covered literature rather than survey objectives (e.g., “We review InstructGPT…” instead of “The survey proposes InstructGPT…”).\n- Tighten motivation to telecom-specific pain points (OPEX, SLA assurance, spectrum efficiency, RAN automation, fault management) and explicitly tie each to LLM capabilities, deployment constraints, and required techniques.\n- In the Abstract, add one sentence stating this survey’s unique contributions (e.g., a new taxonomy, a deployment framework, a comparative mapping of models to tasks, or a consolidated checklist for practitioners).", "3\n\nExplanation:\n- Method Classification Clarity: The paper presents an explicit taxonomy under “Key Techniques in LLMs for Telecommunications,” dividing methods into five categories: (1) Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning Techniques, (2) Prompt Engineering and Optimization, (3) Innovative Model Architectures and Adaptations, (4) Reinforcement Learning and Optimization Strategies, and (5) Energy Efficiency and Computational Optimization. This is a reasonable and commonly used way to structure LLM techniques for an application domain, and it appears clearly in the text with dedicated subsections. For example, the “Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning Techniques” subsection enumerates BERT/RoBERTa/GPT-2 fine-tuning, InstructGPT, LoRA-like ideas (e.g., symbol tuning), and time-series repurposing (Time-LLM, LLM-TSF), situating them as adaptation tools for telecom tasks. Similarly, “Prompt Engineering and Optimization” covers DetPro, least-to-most prompting, OPRO, self-refinement, instruction tuning, and domain frameworks like WirelessLLM, indicating how prompts can be optimized for telecom contexts.\n  - However, boundaries between categories sometimes blur and include techniques not tightly tied to telecom or even to the named category. For instance:\n    - “Reinforcement Learning and Optimization Strategies” mixes chain-of-thought prompting (a prompting technique, not RL) with DRLHP (actual preference-based RL) and ReAct (reasoning-acting framework), diluting category purity.\n    - “Innovative Model Architectures” pulls in Meta-Transformer and Zerocap (general multimodal advances) and ViT references, which are only loosely connected to telecom-specific LLM architectures.\n    - “Energy Efficiency and Computational Optimization” includes GPU-parallel training (TeraPipe, Megatron-LM ILMP) and Vision Transformer comparisons; while relevant to efficiency, these are not coherently justified as telecom-specific computational strategies.\n  - The paper earlier states “Four major aspects of LLMs are covered: pre-training, adaptation tuning, utilization, and capacity evaluation [15]” (Objectives of the Paper), but this four-part lens is not actually used to organize the “Key Techniques” section, creating a mismatch between the stated organizational principle and the realized taxonomy.\n\n- Evolution of Methodology: The survey has a dedicated “Evolution of Large Language Models” subsection, briefly noting scaling from early models to GPT-4, GLM-130B’s positioning, and efficiency improvements via ZeRO. It also mentions movement toward multimodal models and 6G integration in other parts (“Integration with Telecommunications,” “Emerging Opportunities and Challenges,” and “Innovations in Multimodal and Adaptive Models”), which together hint at trends such as edge deployment, cooperative split learning (SLS-LLM), instruction tuning/human alignment (InstructGPT), and tool-augmented agents (ReAct).\n  - Nonetheless, the evolution is not systematically presented as a coherent timeline or staged progression specific to telecom. The “Evolution of Large Language Models” section is high-level and does not articulate clear phases (e.g., pretraining era → task-specific fine-tuning → instruction tuning/RLHF → tool use/multi-agent systems → multimodal LMMs → edge/split inference in 6G) with telecom exemplars. Instead, the subsequent “Key Techniques” subsections function as a catalog without explicit inheritance or developmental links between techniques.\n  - Connections between categories and trends are not consistently drawn. For example, while edge deployment and split learning appear in “Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning Techniques” (SLS-LLM) and later in “Emerging Opportunities,” the paper does not explicitly connect how advances in efficiency (e.g., ZeRO, TeraPipe, LoRA) enable the telecom trend of on-device/edge collaboration for 6G. Similarly, the path from prompting advances (least-to-most, CoT) to more agentic frameworks (ReAct) is not narrated as an evolutionary arc.\n  - Several editorial issues suggest incomplete synthesis of the evolution narrative: “The following sections are organized as shown in .” (missing figure), “Tree of Thoughts framework ... achieving a 74” (truncated), “FrugalGPT demonstrates significant cost reductions, achieving up to a 98\\” (truncated). These undermine the systematic portrayal of methodological progression.\n\nOverall, while the taxonomy is visible and broadly reasonable, it is more a topical catalog than a development roadmap; and the evolution narrative is only partially articulated and not tightly tied to telecom milestones. This aligns with a score of 3 per the rubric: somewhat vague classification in places, and a partially clear but insufficiently systematic evolution with limited analysis of inheritance and unclear evolutionary directions.", "2\n\nExplanation:\n\n- Limited diversity and detail of datasets:\n  - The survey names only a few datasets/benchmarks explicitly and provides minimal detail about them. The clearest telecom-specific dataset is SPEC5G: “The SPEC5G dataset, encompassing textual data related to 5G protocol specifications, highlights LLMs' relevance in telecommunications by enabling tasks such as text classification and summarization [41].” While this identifies the domain and task types, it lacks basic dataset descriptors (scale, labeling protocol, splits, licensing, languages, class balance), which are required for high-quality dataset coverage.\n  - It mentions “a comparative analysis using Cradlepoint’s data” in the Structure of the Survey section and again in Applications in Telecommunications, but does not describe what this dataset contains (e.g., number of documents, modalities, annotation scheme), how it was collected, or how it is used for evaluation.\n  - “CloudEval-YAML experiments” are referenced under Network Optimization, but the paper does not explain what CloudEval-YAML is, what datasets and tasks it comprises, or how it maps to telecom LLM use cases.\n  - Outside telecom, it references broad or model-centric artifacts (e.g., “BloombergGPT” and “SciBERT”), but without dataset specifics relevant to telecom; these are not substitutes for domain datasets.\n  - General references to “a comprehensive analysis of datasets related to accuracy, calibration, robustness, fairness, bias, toxicity, and efficiency [36]” under Applications in Various Domains are high-level and do not enumerate datasets nor provide details.\n  - Other mentions (e.g., “SecurityBERT… structured representations of network traffic data [89]”) suggest possible datasets exist, but none are described substantively. Similarly, mentions of time-series forecasting work (Time-LLM, LLM-TSF) provide no dataset identifiers (e.g., M4/M5, ETT, electricity, traffic) or telecom-specific time-series corpora.\n\n- Sparse and non-systematic metrics coverage:\n  - Metrics are referenced only in general or anecdotal terms. For instance: “A comprehensive analysis of datasets related to accuracy, calibration, robustness, fairness, bias, toxicity, and efficiency [36]” lists families of evaluation dimensions but does not specify concrete metrics (e.g., Exact Match, F1, ROUGE/BLEU, ECE, toxicity scores) or how they are applied in telecom tasks.\n  - Under Energy Efficiency and Computational Optimization, the paper notes “Exploring energy consumption metrics provides insights into trade-offs…” and mentions “energy benchmarking for LLM inference [68]”, but does not specify which metrics (e.g., Joules/inference, Tokens/Joule, latency, throughput) or standard tools/benchmarks (e.g., MLPerf Inference, Carbon tracker methodologies).\n  - Some numerical claims are vague or truncated: “achieving a 74…” under Tree of Thoughts and “FrugalGPT… achieving up to a 98\\” (appears truncated) without clear definition of the metric or task context. Predictive maintenance claims “accuracy rates exceeding 90” are similarly non-specific (no task, dataset, or metric definition).\n  - For network-centered evaluation, the survey does not systematically state telecom KPI metrics (latency, reliability, jitter, throughput, spectral efficiency, SLA violations, ticket resolution time) or how LLM-driven systems would be assessed against them.\n  - For code generation and retrieval tasks mentioned, standard metrics (e.g., pass@k for code, Recall@k/MRR/NDCG for retrieval) are not specified.\n\n- Rationale and alignment:\n  - The survey’s objectives emphasize telecom integration, domain adaptation, and evaluation of LLM capabilities in telecom contexts (e.g., SPEC5G, WirelessLLM, ISATNs, customer service automation). However, the dataset and metric choices presented do not sufficiently support these goals. The lack of concrete, telecom-relevant datasets (e.g., annotated 3GPP corpora with labeled tasks, trouble ticket logs, network KPI time series with labeled anomalies, conversation datasets for telecom support) and well-defined evaluation protocols undermines the assessment of applicability.\n  - While some cross-domain benchmarks (GSM8K for reasoning, generic robustness/fairness datasets) are touched upon, their telecom relevance and how they map to telecom tasks are not clarified, nor are domain-appropriate metrics proposed.\n\n- Where the paper does slightly better:\n  - SPEC5G is a relevant telecom dataset and is correctly positioned for tasks like “text classification and summarization [41],” indicating an awareness of domain corpora.\n  - The survey acknowledges evaluation dimensions such as calibration, robustness, fairness, toxicity, and energy efficiency, which are important for real-world deployment. However, it stops short of naming metrics, datasets, or standardized protocols to operationalize these dimensions in telecom.\n\nGiven these observations, the review falls short of a comprehensive and detailed coverage of datasets and metrics. It mentions a few relevant items (e.g., SPEC5G) but does not provide the necessary depth (scale, labels, scenarios) or a systematic metric suite tailored to telecom LLM applications. Therefore, a score of 2 is warranted.", "2\n\nDetailed explanation:\n- Overall assessment: The survey organizes the landscape into thematic buckets (e.g., “Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning Techniques,” “Prompt Engineering and Optimization,” “Innovative Model Architectures and Adaptations,” “Reinforcement Learning and Optimization Strategies,” “Energy Efficiency and Computational Optimization”), which is helpful for structure. However, within these sections the treatment largely catalogs methods with brief one-line characterizations and benefits, with minimal explicit, systematic comparison across dimensions such as assumptions, data needs, compute/latency trade-offs, architecture differences, robustness, or telecom-specific deployment constraints. Advantages and disadvantages are rarely contrasted head-to-head and relationships among methods are not analyzed in a structured way. This aligns with a score of 2: mostly listing rather than comparative evaluation.\n\n- Evidence of listing without systematic comparison:\n  - Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning Techniques: “Models like BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2 exemplify the effectiveness of fine-tuning for telecom-specific tasks [3]. Comparative analyses of open-source models such as CodeGen and commercial models like Codex highlight the transformative impact of fine-tuning in telecom applications [43].” The text cites that comparative analyses exist but does not articulate how CodeGen and Codex differ in architecture, licensing constraints, data dependence, or telecom task performance, nor does it enumerate pros/cons; it remains at a high level.\n  - Prompt Engineering and Optimization: The section lists a series of techniques—“detection prompt (DetPro)… least-to-most prompting… OPRO… Self-refinement… OptiChat… Fantastica… Instruction tuning… ChatNet”—each with a brief, favorable description. There is no comparison of assumptions (e.g., DetPro’s continuous prompts vs grammar prompting’s constraints), overhead, stability, sample efficiency, or suitability to specific telecom scenarios. Phrases like “This is beneficial in telecommunications” or “further illustrate prompt engineering’s transformative impact” do not constitute comparative analysis.\n  - Innovative Model Architectures and Adaptations: Again, this section enumerates methods—“DriveGPT4… Megatron-LM intra-layer model parallelism… Meta-Transformer… Zerocap”—but does not contrast architectural differences (e.g., token-space unification in Meta-Transformer vs paired vision-language alignment in Zerocap), training data requirements, or deployment trade-offs pertinent to telecom. Statements like “improve model performance” and “marks a significant advancement” lack grounded comparative metrics or head-to-head distinctions.\n  - Reinforcement Learning and Optimization Strategies: The text lists “chain of thought prompting… DRLHP… ReAct… AgentCF… grammar prompting” and offers positive, generic claims (“enhances task-solving capabilities,” “allows nuanced optimization”). It does not compare when one approach is preferable, their respective scalability, sample complexity, or alignment costs in telecom operations.\n  - Energy Efficiency and Computational Optimization: Multiple techniques are mentioned—“TeraPipe… EPSL… FrugalGPT… ViT… ILMP (Megatron-LM)… Fantastica… energy consumption metrics”—without contrasting their mechanisms (token-level pipeline parallelism vs intra-layer model parallelism), their effects on latency vs throughput, or constraints in edge vs cloud inference. Notably, “FrugalGPT demonstrates significant cost reductions, achieving up to a 98\\” is truncated, reducing clarity and rigor.\n\n- Lack of explicit advantages/disadvantages and commonalities/distinctions:\n  - Across sections, methods are presented with positive descriptors but without explicit disadvantages or limitations. For example, “Advanced techniques like symbol tuning… enhance adaptability to telecom applications [44]” provides no trade-offs compared to prompt tuning, fine-tuning, or LoRA.\n  - The “Structure of the Survey” claims “a comparative analysis using Cradlepoint’s data, showcasing how LLMs can adapt to domain-specific terminology…” but in this manuscript there is no detailed exposition of methods compared, criteria, or outcomes; thus, the claimed comparison is not substantiated with systematic analysis here.\n  - “Evolution of Large Language Models” notes “The GLM-130B model, surpassing GPT-3 175B on multiple benchmarks [4],” but does not dissect why (training data, tokenizer, bilingual objective), nor what that implies for telecom tasks versus other models.\n\n- Limited explanation of differences in terms of architecture, objectives, or assumptions:\n  - Examples: “Intra-layer model parallelism techniques, as proposed in Megatron-LM, improve model performance…” vs “TeraPipe… token-level pipeline parallelism” are mentioned in separate sections, but there is no contrast of architectural implications, communication overhead, or suitability for telecom training/inference regimes.\n  - “ReAct… interleaves reasoning with action generation” and “chain of thought prompting… reasoning exemplars” share a reasoning focus but their differing assumptions and operational contexts are not contrasted (e.g., tool use requirements, latency impact, controllability).\n\n- Fragmentation and clarity issues further weakening rigor:\n  - In “Network Optimization,” “The Tree of Thoughts framework enhances problem-solving, achieving a 74” is incomplete and uninformative for comparative purposes.\n  - In “Energy Efficiency…,” “FrugalGPT demonstrates significant cost reductions, achieving up to a 98\\” is truncated, undermining clarity and preventing quantitative comparison.\n\n- Where the paper does better:\n  - The categorical organization helps readers navigate method families, and the text occasionally links methods to telecom tasks (e.g., “SLS-LLM… across mobile devices and edge servers [7],” “Time-LLM… time series forecasting [46],” “WirelessLLM” across sections). However, these are task-to-method mappings rather than comparative evaluations across dimensions.\n\nGiven these observations, the section mainly lists techniques with limited explicit, structured comparison of advantages/disadvantages, commonalities/distinctions, and differences in architecture/objectives/assumptions. Therefore, a score of 2 is appropriate.", "Score: 3/5\n\nExplanation:\nThe survey offers broad coverage and includes some evaluative comments, but its critical analysis is relatively shallow and uneven. It mostly enumerates methods and applications with brief benefits, while providing limited technically grounded explanations of why methods differ, what assumptions and trade-offs they entail, and how research lines interrelate. Below are specific observations tied to sections and sentences in the text.\n\nWhere the paper provides some analytical interpretation:\n- Challenges and Limitations: This is the strongest locus of causal commentary, moving beyond description to identify some underlying reasons for method constraints.\n  - “Communication overhead in methods like Megatron-LM can hinder scalability as model sizes and GPU counts increase.” This gives a causal mechanism (communication overhead) linked to scalability limits, though it stops short of discussing concrete patterns (e.g., tensor/pipeline parallel communication, KV cache sharding) or mitigation trade-offs.\n  - “Performance inconsistencies based on tokenization strategies pose challenges for LLMs in forecasting tasks, affecting reliability in predictive maintenance applications [6].” This gestures at a root cause (tokenization effects) but does not unpack where/why tokenization hurts time-series modeling (e.g., quantization of numeric patterns, positional encoding interactions), nor compare against alternatives (e.g., continuous embeddings or adapters).\n  - “Reliance on edge servers and potential delays during long-horizon interactions highlight the need for efficient collaboration between mobile devices and edge infrastructure [7].” This identifies a clear deployment trade-off (latency/privacy vs. capability), although it does not analyze scheduling, batching, or offloading policies in depth.\n  - “The lack of paired training data can limit model performance across diverse modalities, impacting adaptability to specific tasks [31].” This is a reasonable causal statement for multimodal models, but lacks follow-through on how meta-learning or contrastive pretraining mitigate it.\n\n- Energy Efficiency and Computational Optimization:\n  - “The TeraPipe technique enhances training for large-scale language models through token-level pipeline parallelism… [65].” and “The ILMP technique, as proposed in Megatron-LM, allows efficient transformer model training by distributing layers across multiple GPUs… [60].” These sentences acknowledge architectural choices designed to address compute/memory bottlenecks, but there is little discussion of the design trade-offs (e.g., bubble overhead, micro-batch sizing, interconnect bandwidth constraints) or their operational implications in telecom workloads (long sequences, burstiness).\n\n- Background and Core Concepts:\n  - “Applying Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning principles offers insights into the finite sample complexity of in-context learning… [31].” This is an attempt to ground behavior in theory. However, the paper does not draw out what this implies for telecom deployments (e.g., data regime requirements, robustness to distributional shift) or compare with alternative views (Bayesian or mechanistic explanations).\n  - “Despite their potential, deploying LLMs is challenging due to high memory and computational demands… Innovations like the Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO) enhance memory efficiency during training [5].” This moves toward causal explanation (memory footprint → ZeRO) but remains a high-level assertion without discussing assumptions (optimizer states, offloading, activation checkpointing) or trade-offs (throughput penalty, fault tolerance).\n\nWhere the paper remains largely descriptive and misses deeper critical analysis:\n- Key Techniques in LLMs for Telecommunications (all subsections: Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning; Prompt Engineering and Optimization; Innovative Model Architectures and Adaptations; Reinforcement Learning and Optimization Strategies; Energy Efficiency and Computational Optimization):\n  - Across these subsections, the survey predominantly lists methods and claims benefits. For example:\n    - “InstructGPT… aligning language models with user intent through human feedback, improving task performance in telecom settings [5].”\n    - “The least-to-most prompting method addresses complex reasoning tasks… [51].”\n    - “The ReAct framework interleaves reasoning with action generation… [45].”\n    - “Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)… reducing memory requirements while enhancing training throughput… [86].”\n  - These statements do not explain fundamental causes of performance differences (e.g., why RLHF’s reward modeling and preference data characteristics matter for telco tasks; when CoT or least-to-most fail or introduce hallucinations; what LoRA’s rank choices trade off in adaptation capacity vs interference; how retrieval-augmented prompting interacts with domain drift in 3GPP specs).\n  - There is little cross-method synthesis. For example, the paper does not systematically connect:\n    - Fine-tuning vs prompt-tuning vs LoRA vs adapters under telecom constraints (data scarcity, privacy, on-device limits).\n    - RLHF/DRLHP vs supervised finetuning in terms of alignment stability, brittleness, and safety for network automation.\n    - Edge/offloading strategies vs energy/latency constraints and how model/parallelism choices exacerbate or mitigate these.\n  - Assumptions remain implicit. For instance, Time-LLM/LLM-TSF are cited for forecasting, but the survey does not analyze assumptions around stationarity, seasonality encoding, or numeric representation challenges for LLMs; nor does it contrast with specialized TS models in telecom telemetry.\n\n- Integration with Telecommunications and Applications of LLMs in Telecommunications:\n  - These sections list applications (e.g., NETBUDDY, VPP, OptiChat, CloudEval-YAML) with benefits (“reducing errors,” “improving satisfaction”), but provide little technical reasoning about why LLMs succeed or fail under telecom data and operational constraints (e.g., noisy logs, multilingual artifacts, strict SLAs, safety requirements).\n  - Claims like “These methods exhibit self-optimizing capabilities, improving coverage and reducing interference, surpassing traditional techniques [64]” are asserted without dissecting the mechanism (e.g., what the learned policy optimizes, exploration safety in live networks, sample efficiency, partial observability), or the trade-offs versus rule-based SON systems.\n\n- Innovative Model Architectures and Adaptations:\n  - Examples such as “Vision Transformer (ViT) … enhancing image processing tasks within telecom systems” and “Zerocap… image-to-text generation” are presented without analyzing why these choices fit telecom data distributions, latency budgets, or deployment constraints, nor comparing to alternatives (CNNs with distillation; lightweight encoders; edge vision models).\n\n- Future Research Directions:\n  - The section enumerates many topics but does not synthesize tensions (e.g., privacy vs performance; generality vs domain specificity; explainability vs autonomy), nor does it articulate hypothesized causal pathways or evaluation criteria that would resolve debates.\n\nAdditional issues that weaken the analytical depth:\n- Occasional incomplete or overgeneral claims without context:\n  - “FrugalGPT demonstrates significant cost reductions, achieving up to a 98…” (sentence appears truncated) and “Experimental results indicate advancements… with accuracy rates exceeding 90” are stated without datasets, baselines, or conditions, limiting evaluative credibility.\n- Limited discussion of failure modes and negative results (e.g., hallucination risks in network configuration generation; brittleness of CoT; safety/rollback mechanisms under RL-based automation).\n- Minimal quantitative or mechanistic comparisons (e.g., attention complexity with long telemetry sequences; KV-cache and memory bandwidth as bottlenecks; inference batching on edge).\n\nSummary judgment:\n- The paper moves beyond pure listing in places (especially the Challenges and Limitations subsection) and occasionally points to causal factors (communication overhead, tokenization effects, edge offloading latency). However, most sections emphasize descriptive coverage over technically grounded comparative analysis, with few explicit discussions of design trade-offs, assumptions, or synthesized relationships across methods and research lines.\n- Therefore, the critical analysis dimension merits a 3/5: it contains basic analytical comments and some evaluative statements, but depth and rigor are limited, and the interpretive insights are not consistently developed across the surveyed methods.", "Score: 4/5\n\nExplanation:\nThe paper identifies a broad and reasonably comprehensive set of research gaps and future work items, touching data, methods, model architectures, deployment, and evaluation. However, most items are presented as brief lists with limited depth on why each gap matters for telecommunications specifically, what the concrete impact would be if unaddressed, or how to prioritize and operationalize solutions. This breadth-with-limited-depth profile aligns with a 4/5 per the rubric.\n\nEvidence of comprehensive gap identification:\n- Challenges and Limitations section explicitly surfaces multiple, diverse gaps:\n  - Data gaps:\n    - “A primary concern is the dependency on training dataset quality and representativeness, affecting LLM generalizability across diverse telecom documents [48].”\n    - “The lack of paired training data can limit model performance across diverse modalities, impacting adaptability to specific tasks [31].”\n  - Privacy and security:\n    - “Privacy concerns are paramount, given LLMs’ requirement for extensive datasets, potentially exposing sensitive information [8].”\n  - Computation/efficiency/scalability:\n    - “Computational demands vary significantly across model sizes and hardware configurations, creating barriers to efficient deployment [4].”\n    - “Communication overhead in methods like Megatron-LM can hinder scalability as model sizes and GPU counts increase.”\n    - “Reliance on edge servers and potential delays during long-horizon interactions highlight the need for efficient collaboration between mobile devices and edge infrastructure [7].”\n  - Methods/accuracy/robustness:\n    - “Performance inconsistencies based on tokenization strategies pose challenges for LLMs in forecasting tasks, affecting reliability in predictive maintenance applications [6].”\n    - “Models like InstructGPT still exhibit inaccuracies, indicating ongoing challenges in aligning LLMs with user expectations [5].”\n    - “Limitations in capturing user behavior nuances due to reliance on existing interaction records hinder comprehensive user model development [29].”\n    - “Emphasis on model scale rather than architectural nuances may restrict understanding of LLM capabilities, necessitating tailored solutions [25].”\n  - Ambition/AGI trajectory:\n    - “Transitioning from traditional next-word prediction to achieving deeper artificial general intelligence (AGI) to tackle complex telecom issues is a significant challenge [1].”\n\n- Future Research Directions section spans many actionable directions, indicating breadth:\n  - Network/physical layer optimization:\n    - “Refining heuristic algorithms and integrating machine learning techniques to optimize Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-assisted networks [77].”\n    - “Investigating hybrid access techniques and AI integration in optimizing NOMA systems [21].”\n  - Evaluation and benchmarks:\n    - “Expanding benchmarks to encompass a broader array of hardware design scenarios and programming languages [43].”\n  - Methodological improvements for forecasting and reasoning:\n    - “Enhancing tokenization methods and improving uncertainty calibration techniques … for a wider range of forecasting tasks [47].”\n    - “Integrating reasoning and acting in complex scenarios, along with enhancements to model architecture [45].”\n    - “Refining retrieval techniques for NLP models to boost LLM adaptability in telecom tasks [30].”\n  - Multilingual/domain transfer and training optimization:\n    - “Optimizing training processes and applying GLM-130B in various languages or specialized domains [4].”\n  - Human-model interaction and behavior modeling:\n    - “Enhancing models’ adaptability to new user behaviors and incorporating non-verbal cues for improved interaction simulations [29].”\n  - Broader AI directions and ethics:\n    - “Explor[ing] new paradigms in AI development … and examining ethical and societal implications of AGI [1].”\n  - Documentation and process automation:\n    - “Applying existing methods to a wider range of documents and integrating generative AI techniques to streamline automation processes [3].”\n\n- Emerging Opportunities and Challenges section also indirectly points to gaps by framing opportunity areas that remain underdeveloped for telecom-scale deployment:\n  - Efficiency/scalability:\n    - “Opportunities in Model Efficiency and Scalability” citing ALBERT [84], TeraPipe [65], LoRA [86], and prompt tuning [88], indicating ongoing needs to reduce memory/latency/energy for telecom use cases.\n  - Edge deployment and privacy trade-offs:\n    - “Deploying LLMs at the edge improves response times and privacy… [26],” implying gaps in robust, privacy-preserving edge solutions at telecom scale.\n\nWhy it is not a 5:\n- Limited depth of causal analysis and impact:\n  - While many gaps are named, the paper rarely explains the telecom-specific ramifications in detail. For instance, “Privacy concerns are paramount…” [8] does not analyze how telecom regulatory obligations (e.g., lawful intercept, DPI, data residency) or operator data-sharing constraints shape feasible LLM training/deployment pipelines, nor the operational risks if mishandled.\n  - “Computational demands vary significantly…” [4] and “Communication overhead…” (Megatron-LM) are noted, but there is limited analysis of how these constraints manifest in real operator environments (e.g., OPEX/energy budgets, latency SLAs in RAN/Core/edge segments), or how they impact closed-loop automation safety.\n  - “Reliance on edge servers…” [7] identifies a performance issue but does not deeply analyze the impact on long-horizon control loops, service reliability, or mitigation trade-offs (e.g., partial on-device inference, model partitioning, caching).\n  - “Performance inconsistencies based on tokenization…” [6] and forecasting reliability are mentioned without exploring the downstream effects on maintenance scheduling, SLA breaches, or cost-of-failure in telecom operations.\n\n- Lack of systematic structuring and prioritization:\n  - The Future Research Directions list is extensive but not organized into a clear taxonomy (e.g., data, model/learning methods, system integration, evaluation/benchmarks, governance/safety) nor prioritized by urgency, maturity, or impact on 5G/6G roadmaps.\n  - Many items are generic to AI research (e.g., AGI ethics, better reasoning) and not always tied back with depth to telecom-specific constraints, KPIs, and standards.\n\n- Limited discussion on verification/validation and safety of autonomous control:\n  - Given the telecom context, there is little gap analysis on verification and validation of LLM-driven actions in network control loops, safety guarantees, rollback/guardrails, observability, and incident response—critical for carrier-grade reliability.\n\n- Evaluation and reproducibility gaps are only lightly treated:\n  - While “Expanding benchmarks…” [43] and SPEC5G [41] are mentioned, there is limited analysis of comprehensive evaluation protocols, cross-operator datasets, domain drift over 3GPP releases, or standardized metrics for LLM-in-the-loop network operations.\n\nOverall judgment:\n- The section identifies many of the right unknowns and needed directions across data, methods, deployment, and evaluation, supporting a high score on coverage.\n- The treatment is often brief and does not fully analyze why each gap matters for telecom operations, regulatory compliance, or 6G evolution, nor the potential impact if left unresolved—hence not at the “deeply analyzed” level required for 5/5.", "4\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe survey proposes several forward-looking research directions that are clearly grounded in identified gaps and real-world telecom needs, but the analysis of potential impact and the specificity of actionable pathways are somewhat shallow, preventing a top score.\n\nStrengths supporting the score:\n- Clear linkage to real-world telecom problems:\n  - Future Research Directions explicitly targets telecom-specific systems such as “Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-assisted networks” (“Future research on LLMs in telecommunications should prioritize refining heuristic algorithms and integrating machine learning techniques to optimize Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-assisted networks [77].”), and “NOMA systems” (“Investigating hybrid access techniques and AI integration in optimizing NOMA systems presents emerging trends worthy of exploration [21].”). These topics respond to practical challenges in next-generation wireless networks.\n  - The paper connects forecasting challenges to predictive maintenance and operations: “Enhancing tokenization methods and improving uncertainty calibration techniques will be crucial for applying LLMs to a wider range of forecasting tasks [47].” This is aligned with telecom time-series forecasting needs identified earlier in Applications and Challenges.\n  - It addresses protocol complexity and domain specificity with actionable suggestions: “Expanding benchmarks to encompass a broader array of hardware design scenarios and programming languages could yield insights into optimizing telecom applications [43].” and “Refining retrieval techniques for NLP models to boost LLM adaptability in telecom tasks is essential [30].” These map to real needs in handling 5G/6G specifications (see the SPEC5G mentions in Applications and Emerging Opportunities).\n  - User-centric system needs are acknowledged: “Enhancing models' adaptability to new user behaviors and incorporating non-verbal cues for improved interaction simulations represent critical future research areas [29].” This ties to customer service automation and agent behavior challenges discussed earlier.\n  - Multimodal and adaptive model directions are concrete and telecom-relevant: In Innovations in Multimodal and Adaptive Models, the paper suggests “focusing on enhancing these models' capabilities in niche domains and further architectural improvements to boost performance [90].” and highlights cross-modality approaches like the Meta-Transformer (“mapping raw input data from various modalities into a shared token space... without requiring paired data [31]”), which are highly pertinent to heterogeneous telecom data streams (e.g., logs, sensor data, configuration texts, vision for field operations).\n\n- Alignment to identified gaps and limitations:\n  - The Challenges and Limitations section surfaces specific issues—e.g., “lack of paired training data” [31], “performance inconsistencies based on tokenization strategies” [6], “dependency on training dataset quality” [48], and “reliance on edge servers and potential delays during long-horizon interactions” [7]. The Future Research Directions respond to these by proposing “enhancing tokenization methods,” “optimizing training processes and applying GLM-130B in various languages or specialized domains [4],” and improving interaction modeling (“incorporating non-verbal cues [29]”). This shows thoughtful continuity from gaps to proposed work.\n  - The need to improve reasoning and action integration is acknowledged: “Integrating reasoning and acting in complex scenarios, along with enhancements to model architecture, could significantly advance LLM capabilities [45].” This directly addresses documented reasoning deficits and operational constraints in telecom automation.\n\n- Novel and specific topics:\n  - The proposal to “expand benchmarks... hardware design scenarios and programming languages” [43] is concrete and innovative for bridging LLMs to HDL/code synthesis use cases noted earlier.\n  - The call to “refine retrieval techniques” [30] and “improve uncertainty calibration” [47] are practical, measurable research avenues that can be turned into clear experimental protocols and deployment criteria.\n\nLimitations preventing a score of 5:\n- The discussion is largely enumerative and lacks depth on academic and practical impact:\n  - Many directions are listed briefly without detailing why they are the most impactful for telecom, what metrics should be used, or how they would be operationalized in real deployments (e.g., RIS/NOMA suggestions do not specify concrete evaluation frameworks or integration layers for LLM-driven control).\n  - General statements like “explore new paradigms in AI development, addressing current model limitations and examining ethical and societal implications of AGI [1]” and “applying existing methods to a wider range of documents [3]” are broad and traditional for surveys; they do not present a clear, actionable path tailored to telecom constraints.\n- Limited analysis of cause-and-effect for gaps:\n  - While gaps are identified in Challenges, the Future Research Directions do not deeply analyze root causes (e.g., why tokenization hurts time-series forecasting in telecom data, or the specific architectural bottlenecks in edge-device cooperation) or the expected quantitative impact of proposed remedies.\n- Prioritization and roadmap are missing:\n  - The paper does not lay out a prioritized agenda (near-term vs. long-term), nor does it propose milestone-driven studies or standardized benchmarks for evaluating success across telecom subdomains (e.g., network optimization, customer care agents, predictive maintenance).\n\nSpecific parts that support the evaluation:\n- Future Research Directions:\n  - “Refining heuristic algorithms and integrating machine learning techniques to optimize Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-assisted networks [77].”\n  - “Investigating hybrid access techniques and AI integration in optimizing NOMA systems [21].”\n  - “Expanding benchmarks... hardware design scenarios and programming languages [43].”\n  - “Enhancing tokenization methods and improving uncertainty calibration techniques... forecasting tasks [47].”\n  - “Exploring new paradigms in AI... ethical and societal implications of AGI [1].”\n  - “Integrating reasoning and acting in complex scenarios... enhancements to model architecture [45].”\n  - “Refining retrieval techniques... boost LLM adaptability in telecom tasks [30].”\n  - “Optimizing training processes and applying GLM-130B... languages or specialized domains [4].”\n  - “Enhancing models' adaptability to new user behaviors and incorporating non-verbal cues [29].”\n  - “Applying existing methods to a wider range of documents and integrating generative AI techniques to streamline automation processes [3].”\n- Innovations in Multimodal and Adaptive Models:\n  - “DriveGPT4 exemplifies advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs)...”\n  - “Meta-Transformer... mapping raw input data... without requiring paired data [31].”\n  - “Future research could focus on enhancing these models' capabilities in niche domains and further architectural improvements [90].”\n- Challenges and Limitations (as the basis for gaps addressed):\n  - “lack of paired training data” [31]\n  - “performance inconsistencies based on tokenization strategies” [6]\n  - “dependency on training dataset quality and representativeness” [48]\n  - “reliance on edge servers and potential delays” [7]\n\nOverall, the survey does identify numerous forward-looking, telecom-grounded directions and ties them to known gaps, but it stops short of providing a thorough impact analysis and an actionable roadmap. Hence, it merits 4 points."]}
