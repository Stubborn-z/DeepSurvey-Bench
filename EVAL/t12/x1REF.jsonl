Various algorithms for image segmentation have been developed in the literature. Recently, due to the success of deep learning models in a wide range of vision applications, there has been a substantial amount of works aimed at developing image segmentation approaches using deep learning models. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the literature at the time of this writing, covering a broad spectrum of pioneering works for semantic and instance-level segmentation, including fully convolutional pixel-labeling networks, encoder-decoder architectures, multi-scale and pyramid based approaches, recurrent networks, visual attention models, and generative models in adversarial settings.

We explore variations of self-attention and assess their effectiveness for image recognition. We consider two forms of self-attention. One is pairwise self-attention, which generalizes standard dot-product attention and is fundamentally a set operator. The other is patchwise self-attention, which is strictly more powerful than convolution. Our pairwise self-attention networks match or outperform their convolutional counterparts, and the patchwise models substantially outperform the convolutional baselines. We also conduct experiments that probe the robustness of learned representations and conclude that self-attention networks may have significant benefits in terms of robustness and generalization."}

A common belief is their attention-based token mixer module contributes most to their competence. However, recent works show the attention-based module in Transformers can be replaced by spatial MLPs and the resulted models still perform quite well. Based on this observation, we hypothesize that the general architecture of the Transformers, instead of the specific token mixer module, is more essential to the model's performance. To verify this, we deliberately replace the attention module in Transformers with an embarrassingly simple spatial pooling operator to conduct only basic token mixing. Surprisingly, we observe that the derived model, termed as PoolFormer, achieves competitive performance on multiple computer vision tasks. For example, on ImageNet-1K, PoolFormer achieves 82.1% top-1 accuracy, surpassing well-tuned Vision Transformer/MLP-like baselines DeiT-B/ResMLP-B24 by 0.3%/1.1% accuracy with 35%/52% fewer parameters and 50%/62% fewer MACs. The effectiveness of PoolFormer verifies our hypothesis and urges us to initiate the concept of \"MetaFormer\", a general architecture abstracted from Transformers without specifying the token mixer. Based on the extensive experiments, we argue that MetaFormer is the key player in achieving superior results for recent Transformer and MLP-like models on vision tasks. This work calls for more future research dedicated to improving MetaFormer instead of focusing on the token mixer modules. Additionally, our proposed PoolFormer could serve as a starting baseline for future MetaFormer architecture design. Code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/poolformer."}
{"id": "4", "arxiv": "2007.09451v1", "title": "Feature Pyramid Transformer", "abstract": "Feature interactions across space and scales underpin modern visual recognition systems because they introduce beneficial visual contexts. Conventionally, spatial contexts are passively hidden in the CNN's increasing receptive fields or actively encoded by non-local convolution. Yet, the non-local spatial interactions are not across scales, and thus they fail to capture the non-local contexts of objects (or parts) residing in different scales. To this end, we propose a fully active feature interaction across both space and scales, called Feature Pyramid Transformer (FPT). It transforms any feature pyramid into another feature pyramid of the same size but with richer contexts, by using three specially designed transformers in self-level, top-down, and bottom-up interaction fashion. FPT serves as a generic visual backbone with fair computational overhead. We conduct extensive experiments in both instance-level (i.e., object detection and instance segmentation) and pixel-level segmentation tasks, using various backbones and head networks, and observe consistent improvement over all the baselines and the state-of-the-art methods."}

However, they lack inductive biases and scale quadratically with input length. These limitations are further exacerbated when dealing with the high dimensionality introduced by the temporal dimension. While there are surveys analyzing the advances of Transformers for vision, none focus on an in-depth analysis of video-specific designs. In this survey, we analyze the main contributions and trends of works leveraging Transformers to model video. Specifically, we delve into how videos are handled at the input level first. Then, we study the architectural changes made to deal with video more efficiently, reduce redundancy, re-introduce useful inductive biases, and capture long-term temporal dynamics. In addition, we provide an overview of different training regimes and explore effective self-supervised learning strategies for video. Finally, we conduct a performance comparison on the most common benchmark for Video Transformers (i.e., action classification), finding them to outperform 3D ConvNets even with less computational complexity."}

We present Panoptic SegFormer, a general framework for panoptic segmentation with transformers. It contains three innovative components: an efficient deeply-supervised mask decoder, a query decoupling strategy, and an improved post-processing method. We also use Deformable DETR to efficiently process multi-scale features, which is a fast and efficient version of DETR. Specifically, we supervise the attention modules in the mask decoder in a layer-wise manner. This deep supervision strategy lets the attention modules quickly focus on meaningful semantic regions. It improves performance and reduces the number of required training epochs by half compared to Deformable DETR. Our query decoupling strategy decouples the responsibilities of the query set and avoids mutual interference between things and stuff. In addition, our post-processing strategy improves performance without additional costs by jointly considering classification and segmentation qualities to resolve conflicting mask overlaps. Our approach increases the accuracy 6.2\\% PQ over the baseline DETR model. Panoptic SegFormer achieves state-of-the-art results on COCO test-dev with 56.2\\% PQ.

In contrast, one-stage alternatives cannot compete with Mask R-CNN in mask AP, mainly due to the difficulty of compactly representing masks, making the design of one-stage methods very challenging. In this work, we propose a simple singleshot instance segmentation framework, termed mask encoding based instance segmentation (MEInst). Instead of predicting the two-dimensional mask directly, MEInst distills it into a compact and fixed-dimensional representation vector, which allows the instance segmentation task to be incorporated into one-stage bounding-box detectors and results in a simple yet efficient instance segmentation framework. The proposed one-stage MEInst achieves 36.4% in mask AP with single-model (ResNeXt-101-FPN backbone) and single-scale testing on the MS-COCO benchmark. We show that the much simpler and flexible one-stage instance segmentation method, can also achieve competitive performance.

Masked auto-encoding for feature pretraining and multi-scale hybrid convolution-transformer architectures can further unleash the potentials of ViT, leading to state-of-the-art performances on image classification, detection and semantic segmentation. In this paper, our ConvMAE framework demonstrates that multi-scale hybrid convolution-transformer can learn more discriminative representations via the mask auto-encoding scheme. However, directly using the original masking strategy leads to the heavy computational cost and pretraining-finetuning discrepancy. To tackle the issue, we adopt the masked convolution to prevent information leakage in the convolution blocks. A simple block-wise masking strategy is proposed to ensure computational efficiency. We also propose to more directly supervise the multi-scale features of the encoder to boost multi-scale features. Based on our pretrained ConvMAE models, ConvMAE-Base improves ImageNet-1K finetuning accuracy by 1.4% compared with MAE-Base. On object detection, ConvMAE-Base finetuned for only 25 epochs surpasses MAE-Base fined-tuned for 100 epochs by 2.9% box AP and 2.2% mask AP respectively.

Recently one-stage methods have gained much attention over two-stage approaches due to their simpler design and competitive performance. Here we propose a fully convolutional one-stage object detector (FCOS) to solve object detection in a per-pixel prediction fashion, analogue to other dense prediction problems such as semantic segmentation. Almost all state-of-the-art object detectors such as RetinaNet, SSD, YOLOv3, and Faster R-CNN rely on pre-defined anchor boxes. In contrast, our proposed detector FCOS is anchor box free, as well as proposal free. By eliminating the pre-defined set of anchor boxes, FCOS completely avoids the complicated computation related to anchor boxes such as calculating the intersection over union (IoU) scores during training. More importantly, we also avoid all hyper-parameters related to anchor boxes, which are often sensitive to the final detection performance. With the only post-processing non-maximum suppression (NMS), we demonstrate a much simpler and flexible detection framework achieving improved detection accuracy. We hope that the proposed FCOS framework can serve as a simple and strong alternative for many other instance-level tasks. Code and pre-trained models are available at: https://git.io/AdelaiDet"}

Existing methods track by associating detections through motion-based and appearance-based similarity heuristics. The post-processing nature of association prevents end-to-end exploitation of temporal variations in video sequence.

Track query is transferred and updated frame-by-frame to perform iterative prediction over time. We propose tracklet-aware label assignment to train track queries and newborn object queries. We further propose temporal aggregation network and collective average loss to enhance temporal relation modeling. Experimental results on DanceTrack show that MOTR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art method, ByteTrack by 6.5% on HOTA metric.

However, this crucial module is typically used as a black box, trained independently of the downstream task and on a fixed vocabulary of objects and attributes. This makes it challenging for such systems to capture the long tail of visual concepts expressed in free form text. In this paper we propose MDETR, an end-to-end modulated detector that detects objects in an image conditioned on a raw text query, like a caption or a question. We use a transformer-based architecture to reason jointly over text and image by fusing the two modalities at an early stage of the model. We pre-train the network on 1.3M text-image pairs, mined from pre-existing multi-modal datasets having explicit alignment between phrases in text and objects in the image. We then fine-tune on several downstream tasks such as phrase grounding, referring expression comprehension and segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results on popular benchmarks. We also investigate the utility of our model as an object detector on a given label set when fine-tuned in a few-shot setting. We show that our pre-training approach provides a way to handle the long tail of object categories which have very few labelled instances. Our approach can be easily extended for visual question answering, achieving competitive performance on GQA and CLEVR. The code and models are available at https://github.com/ashkamath/mdetr."}

Previously, most instance segmentation methods heavily rely on object detection and perform mask prediction based on bounding boxes or dense centers. In contrast, we propose a sparse set of instance activation maps, as a new object representation, to highlight informative regions for each foreground object. Then instance-level features are obtained by aggregating features according to the highlighted regions for recognition and segmentation. Moreover, based on bipartite matching, the instance activation maps can predict objects in a one-to-one style, thus avoiding non-maximum suppression (NMS) in post-processing. Owing to the simple yet effective designs with instance activation maps, SparseInst has extremely fast inference speed and achieves 40 FPS and 37.9 AP on the COCO benchmark, which significantly outperforms the counterparts in terms of speed and accuracy.

In this paper we introduce Segmenter, a transformer model for semantic segmentation. In contrast to convolution-based methods, our approach allows to model global context already at the first layer and throughout the network. We build on the recent Vision Transformer (ViT) and extend it to semantic segmentation. To do so, we rely on the output embeddings corresponding to image patches and obtain class labels from these embeddings with a point-wise linear decoder or a mask transformer decoder. We leverage models pre-trained for image classification and show that we can fine-tune them on moderate sized datasets available for semantic segmentation. The linear decoder allows to obtain excellent results already, but the performance can be further improved by a mask transformer generating class masks. We conduct an extensive ablation study to show the impact of the different parameters, in particular the performance is better for large models and small patch sizes. Segmenter attains excellent results for semantic segmentation. It outperforms the state of the art on both ADE20K and Pascal Context datasets and is competitive on Cityscapes."}

Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with \\textbf{S}hifted \\textbf{win}dows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones. The hierarchical design and the shifted window approach also prove beneficial for all-MLP architectures.

Existing approaches use pretrained models to facilitate learning, yet separately transfer the language/vision knowledge from pretrained models, ignoring the multi-modal corresponding information. Inspired by the recent advance in Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), in this paper, we propose an end-to-end CLIP-Driven Referring Image Segmentation framework (CRIS). To transfer the multi-modal knowledge effectively, CRIS resorts to vision-language decoding and contrastive learning for achieving the text-to-pixel alignment. More specifically, we design a vision-language decoder to propagate fine-grained semantic information from textual representations to each pixel-level activation, which promotes consistency between the two modalities. In addition, we present text-to-pixel contrastive learning to explicitly enforce the text feature similar to the related pixel-level features and dissimilar to the irrelevances. The experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art performance without any post-processing.

Prior works address this problem by simply adding a dense depth regression head to panoptic segmentation (PS) networks, resulting in two independent task branches. This neglects the mutually-beneficial relations between these two tasks, thus failing to exploit handy instance-level semantic cues to boost depth accuracy while also producing sub-optimal depth maps. To overcome these limitations, we propose a unified framework for the DPS task by applying a dynamic convolution technique to both the PS and depth prediction tasks. Specifically, instead of predicting depth for all pixels at a time, we generate instance-specific kernels to predict depth and segmentation masks for each instance. Moreover, leveraging the instance-wise depth estimation scheme, we add additional instance-level depth cues to assist with supervising the depth learning via a new depth loss. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes-DPS and SemKITTI-DPS show the effectiveness and promise of our method. We hope our unified solution to DPS can lead a new paradigm in this area.

It is the hierarchical Transformers (e.g., Swin Transformers) that reintroduced several ConvNet priors, making Transformers practically viable as a generic vision backbone and demonstrating remarkable performance on a wide variety of vision tasks. However, the effectiveness of such hybrid approaches is still largely credited to the intrinsic superiority of Transformers, rather than the inherent inductive biases of convolutions. In this work, we reexamine the design spaces and test the limits of what a pure ConvNet can achieve. We gradually \"modernize\" a standard ResNet toward the design of a vision Transformer, and discover several key components that contribute to the performance difference along the way. The outcome of this exploration is a family of pure ConvNet models dubbed ConvNeXt. Constructed entirely from standard ConvNet modules, ConvNeXts compete favorably with Transformers in terms of accuracy and scalability, achieving 87.8% ImageNet top-1 accuracy and outperforming Swin Transformers on COCO detection and ADE20K segmentation, while maintaining the simplicity and efficiency of standard ConvNets."}

In this work, we devise a new training framework that boosts query-based models through discriminative query embedding learning. It explores two essential properties, namely dataset-level uniqueness and transformation equivariance, of the relation between queries and instances. First, our algorithm uses the queries to retrieve the corresponding instances from the whole training dataset, instead of only searching within individual scenes. As querying instances across scenes is more challenging, the segmenters are forced to learn more discriminative queries for effective instance separation. Second, our algorithm encourages both image (instance) representations and queries to be equivariant against geometric transformations, leading to more robust, instance-query matching. On top of four famous, query-based models ($i.e.,$ CondInst, SOLOv2, SOTR, and Mask2Former), our training algorithm provides significant performance gains ($e.g.,$ +1.6 - 3.2 AP) on COCO dataset.

The subsequent work, Deformable DETR, enhances the efficiency of DETR by replacing dense attention with deformable attention, which achieves 10x faster convergence and improved performance. Deformable DETR uses the multiscale feature to ameliorate performance, however, the number of encoder tokens increases by 20x compared to DETR, and the computation cost of the encoder attention remains a bottleneck. In our preliminary experiment, we observe that the detection performance hardly deteriorates even if only a part of the encoder token is updated. Inspired by this observation, we propose Sparse DETR that selectively updates only the tokens expected to be referenced by the decoder, thus help the model effectively detect objects. In addition, we show that applying an auxiliary detection loss on the selected tokens in the encoder improves the performance while minimizing computational overhead. We validate that Sparse DETR achieves better performance than Deformable DETR even with only 10% encoder tokens on the COCO dataset. Albeit only the encoder tokens are sparsified, the total computation cost decreases by 38% and the frames per second (FPS) increases by 42% compared to Deformable DETR.

In contrast to discrete tokens in natural languages, the input for image MAE is continuous and subject to additional specifications. We systematically study each input specification during the pre-training stage, and find sequence length is a key axis that further scales MAE. Our study leads to a long-sequence version of MAE with minimal changes to the original recipe, by just decoupling the mask size from the patch size. For object detection and semantic segmentation, our long-sequence MAE shows consistent gains across all the experimental setups without extra computation cost during the transfer. While long-sequence pre-training is discerned most beneficial for detection and segmentation, we also achieve strong results on ImageNet-1K classification by keeping a standard image size and only increasing the sequence length. We hope our findings can provide new insights and avenues for scaling in computer vision."}
{"id": "32", "arxiv": "2207.10661v1", "title": "In Defense of Online Models for Video Instance Segmentation", "abstract": "In recent years, video instance segmentation (VIS) has been largely advanced by offline models, while online models gradually attracted less attention possibly due to their inferior performance. However, online methods have their inherent advantage in handling long video sequences and ongoing videos while offline models fail due to the limit of computational resources. Therefore, it would be highly desirable if online models can achieve comparable or even better performance than offline models. By dissecting current online models and offline models, we demonstrate that the main cause of the performance gap is the error-prone association between frames caused by the similar appearance among different instances in the feature space. Observing this, we propose an online framework based on contrastive learning that is able to learn more discriminative instance embeddings for association and fully exploit history information for stability. Despite its simplicity, our method outperforms all online and offline methods on three benchmarks. Specifically, we achieve 49.5 AP on YouTube-VIS 2019, a significant improvement of 13.2 AP and 2.1 AP over the prior online and offline art, respectively. Moreover, we achieve 30.2 AP on OVIS, a more challenging dataset with significant crowding and occlusions, surpassing the prior art by 14.8 AP. The proposed method won first place in the video instance segmentation track of the 4th Large-scale Video Object Segmentation Challenge (CVPR2022). We hope the simplicity and effectiveness of our method, as well as our insight into current methods, could shed light on the exploration of VIS models."}

Our MAE approach is simple: we mask random patches of the input image and reconstruct the missing pixels. It is based on two core designs. First, we develop an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture, with an encoder that operates only on the visible subset of patches (without mask tokens), along with a lightweight decoder that reconstructs the original image from the latent representation and mask tokens. Second, we find that masking a high proportion of the input image, e.g., 75%, yields a nontrivial and meaningful self-supervisory task. Coupling these two designs enables us to train large models efficiently and effectively: we accelerate training (by 3x or more) and improve accuracy. Our scalable approach allows for learning high-capacity models that generalize well: e.g., a vanilla ViT-Huge model achieves the best accuracy (87.8%) among methods that use only ImageNet-1K data. Transfer performance in downstream tasks outperforms supervised pre-training and shows promising scaling behavior."}

The conventional training paradigm is to learn to make predictions on query images conditioned on the features from support images. Previous methods only utilized the semantic-level prototypes of support images as conditional information. These methods cannot utilize all pixel-wise support information for the query predictions, which is however critical for the segmentation task. In this paper, we focus on utilizing pixel-wise relationships between support and query images to facilitate the few-shot segmentation task. We design a novel Cycle-Consistent TRansformer (CyCTR) module to aggregate pixel-wise support features into query ones. CyCTR performs cross-attention between features from different images, i.e. support and query images. We observe that there may exist unexpected irrelevant pixel-level support features. Directly performing cross-attention may aggregate these features from support to query and bias the query features. Thus, we propose using a novel cycle-consistent attention mechanism to filter out possible harmful support features and encourage query features to attend to the most informative pixels from support images. Experiments on all few-shot segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed CyCTR leads to remarkable improvement compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, on Pascal-$5^i$ and COCO-$20^i$ datasets, we achieve 67.5% and 45.6% mIoU for 5-shot segmentation, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods by 5.6% and 7.1% respectively."}

Second, these features are also excellent k-NN classifiers, reaching 78.3% top-1 on ImageNet with a small ViT. Our study also underlines the importance of momentum encoder, multi-crop training, and the use of small patches with ViTs.

Using box coordinates not only helps using explicit positional priors to improve the query-to-feature similarity and eliminate the slow training convergence issue in DETR, but also allows us to modulate the positional attention map using the box width and height information. Such a design makes it clear that queries in DETR can be implemented as performing soft ROI pooling layer-by-layer in a cascade manner. As a result, it leads to the best performance on MS-COCO benchmark among the DETR-like detection models under the same setting, e.g., AP 45.7\\% using ResNet50-DC5 as backbone trained in 50 epochs.

Three main techniques are proposed: 1) a residual-post-norm method combined with cosine attention to improve training stability; 2) A log-spaced continuous position bias method to effectively transfer models pre-trained using low-resolution images to downstream tasks with high-resolution inputs; 3) A self-supervised pre-training method, SimMIM, to reduce the needs of vast labeled images.

Inspired by Conditional DETR, an improved DETR with fast training convergence, that presented box queries (originally called spatial queries) for internal decoder layers, we reformulate the object query into the format of the box query that is a composition of the embeddings of the reference point and the transformation of the box with respect to the reference point. This reformulation indicates the connection between the object query in DETR and the anchor box that is widely studied in Faster R-CNN. Furthermore, we learn the box queries from the image content, further improving the detection quality of Conditional DETR still with fast training convergence. In addition, we adopt the idea of axial self-attention to save the memory cost and accelerate the encoder. The resulting detector, called Conditional DETR V2, achieves better results than Conditional DETR, saves the memory cost and runs more efficiently. For example, for the DC$5$-ResNet-$50$ backbone, our approach achieves $44.8$ AP with $16.4$ FPS on the COCO $val$ set and compared to Conditional DETR, it runs $1.6\\times$ faster, saves $74$\\% of the overall memory cost, and improves $1.0$ AP score."}

First, we highlight convolution with upsampled filters, or 'atrous convolution', as a powerful tool in dense prediction tasks. Atrous convolution allows us to explicitly control the resolution at which feature responses are computed within Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. It also allows us to effectively enlarge the field of view of filters to incorporate larger context without increasing the number of parameters or the amount of computation. Second, we propose atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) to robustly segment objects at multiple scales. ASPP probes an incoming convolutional feature layer with filters at multiple sampling rates and effective fields-of-views, thus capturing objects as well as image context at multiple scales. Third, we improve the localization of object boundaries by combining methods from DCNNs and probabilistic graphical models. The commonly deployed combination of max-pooling and downsampling in DCNNs achieves invariance but has a toll on localization accuracy. We overcome this by combining the responses at the final DCNN layer with a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF), which is shown both qualitatively and quantitatively to improve localization performance. Our proposed \"DeepLab\" system sets the new state-of-art at the PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic image segmentation task, reaching 79.7% mIOU in the test set, and advances the results on three other datasets: PASCAL-Context, PASCAL-Person-Part, and Cityscapes.

Our approach is flexible with respect to how tasks define these targets, since it models the latter as abstract 'queries' which are then used to predict pixel-precise target masks. A single TarViS model can be trained jointly on a collection of datasets spanning different tasks, and can hot-swap between tasks during inference without any task-specific retraining. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we apply TarViS to four different tasks, namely Video Instance Segmentation (VIS), Video Panoptic Segmentation (VPS), Video Object Segmentation (VOS) and Point Exemplar-guided Tracking (PET).

The network is an encoder-regressor-decoder architecture: the encoder takes the visible patches as input; the regressor predicts the representations of the masked patches, which are expected to be aligned with the representations computed from the encoder, using the representations of visible patches and the positions of visible and masked patches; the decoder reconstructs the masked patches from the predicted encoded representations. The CAE design encourages the separation of learning the encoder (representation) from completing the pertaining tasks: masked representation prediction and masked patch reconstruction tasks, and making predictions in the encoded representation space empirically shows the benefit to representation learning.

To alleviate this issue, we propose Mask Matching Transformer (MM-Former), a new paradigm for the few-shot segmentation task. Specifically, MM-Former first uses a class-agnostic segmenter to decompose the query image into multiple segment proposals. Then, a simple matching mechanism is applied to merge the related segment proposals into the final mask guided by the support images. The advantages of our MM-Former are two-fold. First, the MM-Former follows the paradigm of decompose first and then blend, allowing our method to benefit from the advanced potential objects segmenter to produce high-quality mask proposals for query images. Second, the mission of prototypical features is relaxed to learn coefficients to fuse correct ones within a proposal pool, making the MM-Former be well generalized to complex scenarios or cases.

This simple design makes video reconstruction a more challenging self-supervision task, thus encouraging extracting more effective video representations during this pre-training process. We obtain three important findings on SSVP: (1) An extremely high proportion of masking ratio (i.e., 90% to 95%) still yields favorable performance of VideoMAE. The temporally redundant video content enables a higher masking ratio than that of images.

However, modern approaches usually compromise spatial resolution to achieve real-time inference speed, which leads to poor performance. In this paper, we address this dilemma with a novel Bilateral Segmentation Network (BiSeNet). We first design a Spatial Path with a small stride to preserve the spatial information and generate high-resolution features. Meanwhile, a Context Path with a fast downsampling strategy is employed to obtain sufficient receptive field. On top of the two paths, we introduce a new Feature Fusion Module to combine features efficiently. The proposed architecture makes a right balance between the speed and segmentation performance on Cityscapes, CamVid, and COCO-Stuff datasets. Specifically, for a 2048x1024 input, we achieve 68.4% Mean IOU on the Cityscapes test dataset with speed of 105 FPS on one NVIDIA Titan XP card, which is significantly faster than the existing methods with comparable performance."}

In this paper, we propose 4D panoptic LiDAR segmentation to assign a semantic class and a temporally-consistent instance ID to a sequence of 3D points. To this end, we present an approach and a point-centric evaluation metric. Our approach determines a semantic class for every point while modeling object instances as probability distributions in the 4D spatio-temporal domain. We process multiple point clouds in parallel and resolve point-to-instance associations, effectively alleviating the need for explicit temporal data association. Inspired by recent advances in benchmarking of multi-object tracking, we propose to adopt a new evaluation metric that separates the semantic and point-to-instance association aspects of the task. With this work, we aim at paving the road for future developments of temporal LiDAR panoptic perception."}

However, existing video segmentation methods predominantly rely on static image segmentation techniques, and methods capturing temporal dependency for segmentation have to depend on pretrained optical flow models, leading to suboptimal solutions for the problem. End-to-end sequential learning to explore spatialtemporal features for video segmentation is largely limited by the scale of available video segmentation datasets, i.e., even the largest video segmentation dataset only contains 90 short video clips. To solve this problem, we build a new large-scale video object segmentation dataset called YouTube Video Object Segmentation dataset (YouTube-VOS). Our dataset contains 4,453 YouTube video clips and 94 object categories. This is by far the largest video object segmentation dataset to our knowledge and has been released at http://youtube-vos.org. We further evaluate several existing state-of-the-art video object segmentation algorithms on this dataset which aims to establish baselines for the development of new algorithms in the future."}

Our new method introduces a new tracking branch to Mask R-CNN to jointly perform the detection, segmentation and tracking tasks simultaneously. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method and several strong baselines on our new dataset. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm and reveal insight for future improvement. We believe the video instance segmentation task will motivate the community along the line of research for video understanding."}

However, we show most of them suffer from significant performance drops on small-size datasets, like Cityscapes. In other words, the detection transformers are generally data-hungry. To tackle this problem, we empirically analyze the factors that affect data efficiency, through a step-by-step transition from a data-efficient RCNN variant to the representative DETR. The empirical results suggest that sparse feature sampling from local image areas holds the key. Based on this observation, we alleviate the data-hungry issue of existing detection transformers by simply alternating how key and value sequences are constructed in the cross-attention layer, with minimum modifications to the original models. Besides, we introduce a simple yet effective label augmentation method to provide richer supervision and improve data efficiency. Experiments show that our method can be readily applied to different detection transformers and improve their performance on both small-size and sample-rich datasets.

The method is built upon K-Net, a method that unifies image segmentation via a group of learnable kernels. We observe that these learnable kernels from K-Net, which encode object appearances and contexts, can naturally associate identical instances across video frames. Motivated by this observation, Video K-Net learns to simultaneously segment and track \"things\" and \"stuff\" in a video with simple kernel-based appearance modeling and cross-temporal kernel interaction. Despite the simplicity, it achieves state-of-the-art video panoptic segmentation results on Citscapes-VPS, KITTI-STEP, and VIPSeg without bells and whistles. In particular, on KITTI-STEP, the simple method can boost almost 12\\% relative improvements over previous methods. On VIPSeg, Video K-Net boosts almost 15\\% relative improvements and results in 39.8 % VPQ. We also validate its generalization on video semantic segmentation, where we boost various baselines by 2\\% on the VSPW dataset. Moreover, we extend K-Net into clip-level video framework for video instance segmentation, where we obtain 40.5% mAP for ResNet50 backbone and 54.1% mAP for Swin-base on YouTube-2019 validation set.

Object detection has benefited enormously from large-scale datasets, especially in the context of deep learning. For semantic urban scene understanding, however, no current dataset adequately captures the complexity of real-world urban scenes. To address this, we introduce Cityscapes, a benchmark suite and large-scale dataset to train and test approaches for pixel-level and instance-level semantic labeling. Cityscapes is comprised of a large, diverse set of stereo video sequences recorded in streets from 50 different cities. 5000 of these images have high quality pixel-level annotations; 20000 additional images have coarse annotations to enable methods that leverage large volumes of weakly-labeled data. Crucially, our effort exceeds previous attempts in terms of dataset size, annotation richness, scene variability, and complexity. Our accompanying empirical study provides an in-depth analysis of the dataset characteristics, as well as a performance evaluation of several state-of-the-art approaches based on our benchmark."}
{"id": "63", "arxiv": "2201.05972v1", "title": "Sparse Cross-scale Attention Network for Efficient LiDAR Panoptic Segmentation", "abstract": "Two major challenges of 3D LiDAR Panoptic Segmentation (PS) are that point clouds of an object are surface-aggregated and thus hard to model the long-range dependency especially for large instances, and that objects are too close to separate each other. Recent literature addresses these problems by time-consuming grouping processes such as dual-clustering, mean-shift offsets, etc., or by bird-eye-view (BEV) dense centroid representation that downplays geometry. However, the long-range geometry relationship has not been sufficiently modeled by local feature learning from the above methods. To this end, we present SCAN, a novel sparse cross-scale attention network to first align multi-scale sparse features with global voxel-encoded attention to capture the long-range relationship of instance context, which can boost the regression accuracy of the over-segmented large objects. For the surface-aggregated points, SCAN adopts a novel sparse class-agnostic representation of instance centroids, which can not only maintain the sparsity of aligned features to solve the under-segmentation on small objects, but also reduce the computation amount of the network through sparse convolution. Our method outperforms previous methods by a large margin in the SemanticKITTI dataset for the challenging 3D PS task, achieving 1st place with a real-time inference speed."}

The state-of-the-art methods learn to decode features with a single positive object and thus have to match and segment each target separately under multi-object scenarios, consuming multiple times computing resources. To solve the problem, we propose an Associating Objects with Transformers (AOT) approach to match and decode multiple objects uniformly. In detail, AOT employs an identification mechanism to associate multiple targets into the same high-dimensional embedding space. Thus, we can simultaneously process multiple objects' matching and segmentation decoding as efficiently as processing a single object. For sufficiently modeling multi-object association, a Long Short-Term Transformer is designed for constructing hierarchical matching and propagation. We conduct extensive experiments on both multi-object and single-object benchmarks to examine AOT variant networks with different complexities. Particularly, our R50-AOT-L outperforms all the state-of-the-art competitors on three popular benchmarks, i.e., YouTube-VOS (84.1% J&F), DAVIS 2017 (84.9%), and DAVIS 2016 (91.1%), while keeping more than $3\\times$ faster multi-object run-time. Meanwhile, our AOT-T can maintain real-time multi-object speed on the above benchmarks. Based on AOT, we ranked 1st in the 3rd Large-scale VOS Challenge."}

Semantic segmentation is one the essential components of environmental perception that provides semantic information of the scene. Recently, several methods have been introduced for 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation. While, they can lead to improved performance, they are either afflicted by high computational complexity, therefore are inefficient, or lack fine details of smaller instances. To alleviate this problem, we propose AF2-S3Net, an end-to-end encoder-decoder CNN network for 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation. We present a novel multi-branch attentive feature fusion module in the encoder and a unique adaptive feature selection module with feature map re-weighting in the decoder. Our AF2-S3Net fuses the voxel based learning and point-based learning into a single framework to effectively process the large 3D scene.

X-Decodert takes as input two types of queries: (i) generic non-semantic queries and (ii) semantic queries induced from text inputs, to decode different pixel-level and token-level outputs in the same semantic space. With such a novel design, X-Decoder is the first work that provides a unified way to support all types of image segmentation and a variety of vision-language (VL) tasks. Further, our design enables seamless interactions across tasks at different granularities and brings mutual benefits by learning a common and rich pixel-level visual-semantic understanding space, without any pseudo-labeling. After pretraining on a mixed set of a limited amount of segmentation data and millions of image-text pairs, X-Decoder exhibits strong transferability to a wide range of downstream tasks in both zero-shot and finetuning settings. Notably, it achieves (1) state-of-the-art results on open-vocabulary segmentation and referring segmentation on eight datasets; (2) better or competitive finetuned performance to other generalist and specialist models on segmentation and VL tasks; and (3) flexibility for efficient finetuning and novel task composition (e.g., referring captioning and image editing).

This restricted form of supervision limits their generality and usability since additional labeled data is needed to specify any other visual concept. Learning directly from raw text about images is a promising alternative which leverages a much broader source of supervision. We demonstrate that the simple pre-training task of predicting which caption goes with which image is an efficient and scalable way to learn SOTA image representations from scratch on a dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the internet. After pre-training, natural language is used to reference learned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling zero-shot transfer of the model to downstream tasks. We study the performance of this approach by benchmarking on over 30 different existing computer vision datasets, spanning tasks such as OCR, action recognition in videos, geo-localization, and many types of fine-grained object classification. The model transfers non-trivially to most tasks and is often competitive with a fully supervised baseline without the need for any dataset specific training. For instance, we match the accuracy of the original ResNet-50 on ImageNet zero-shot without needing to use any of the 1.28 million training examples it was trained on.

We show that the slow convergence results from the instability of bipartite graph matching which causes inconsistent optimization goals in early training stages. To address this issue, except for the Hungarian loss, our method additionally feeds ground-truth bounding boxes with noises into Transformer decoder and trains the model to reconstruct the original boxes, which effectively reduces the bipartite graph matching difficulty and leads to a faster convergence. Our method is universal and can be easily plugged into any DETR-like methods by adding dozens of lines of code to achieve a remarkable improvement. As a result, our DN-DETR results in a remarkable improvement ($+1.9$AP) under the same setting and achieves the best result (AP $43.4$ and $48.6$ with $12$ and $50$ epochs of training respectively) among DETR-like methods with ResNet-$50$ backbone.

This creates a multiscale pyramid of features with early layers operating at high spatial resolution to model simple low-level visual information, and deeper layers at spatially coarse, but complex, high-dimensional features. We evaluate this fundamental architectural prior for modeling the dense nature of visual signals for a variety of video recognition tasks where it outperforms concurrent vision transformers that rely on large scale external pre-training and are 5-10x more costly in computation and parameters.

In this way we can deal with situations where there is a strong imbalance between the number of foreground and background voxels. To cope with the limited number of annotated volumes available for training, we augment the data applying random non-linear transformations and histogram matching.
