We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, exceed the state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation.

We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a novel architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations.

Among their salient benefits, Transformers enable modeling long dependencies between input sequence elements and support parallel processing of sequence as compared to recurrent networks e.g., Long short-term memory (LSTM). Different from convolutional networks, Transformers require minimal inductive biases for their design and are naturally suited as set-functions. Furthermore, the straightforward design of Transformers allows processing multiple modalities (e.g., images, videos, text and speech) using similar processing blocks and demonstrates excellent scalability to very large capacity networks and huge datasets. These strengths have led to exciting progress on a number of vision tasks using Transformer networks. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the Transformer models in the computer vision discipline. We start with an introduction to fundamental concepts behind the success of Transformers i.e., self-attention, large-scale pre-training, and bidirectional encoding. We then cover extensive applications of transformers in vision including popular recognition tasks (e.g., image classification, object detection, action recognition, and segmentation), generative modeling, multi-modal tasks (e.g., visual-question answering, visual reasoning, and visual grounding), video processing (e.g., activity recognition, video forecasting), low-level vision (e.g., image super-resolution, image enhancement, and colorization) and 3D analysis (e.g., point cloud classification and segmentation). We compare the respective advantages and limitations of popular techniques both in terms of architectural design and their experimental value. Finally, we provide an analysis on open research directions and possible future works."}

Panoptic segmentation unifies the typically distinct tasks of semantic segmentation (assign a class label to each pixel) and instance segmentation (detect and segment each object instance). The proposed task requires generating a coherent scene segmentation that is rich and complete, an important step toward real-world vision systems. While early work in computer vision addressed related image/scene parsing tasks, these are not currently popular, possibly due to lack of appropriate metrics or associated recognition challenges. To address this, we propose a novel panoptic quality (PQ) metric that captures performance for all classes (stuff and things) in an interpretable and unified manner. Using the proposed metric, we perform a rigorous study of both human and machine performance for PS on three existing datasets, revealing interesting insights about the task. The aim of our work is to revive the interest of the community in a more unified view of image segmentation."}

In this work, we challenge this paradigm by (a) representing images as semantic visual tokens and (b) running transformers to densely model token relationships. Critically, our Visual Transformer operates in a semantic token space, judiciously attending to different image parts based on context. This is in sharp contrast to pixel-space transformers that require orders-of-magnitude more compute. Using an advanced training recipe, our VTs significantly outperform their convolutional counterparts, raising ResNet accuracy on ImageNet top-1 by 4.6 to 7 points while using fewer FLOPs and parameters.

On various medical image segmentation tasks, the u-shaped architecture, also known as U-Net, has become the de-facto standard and achieved tremendous success. However, due to the intrinsic locality of convolution operations, U-Net generally demonstrates limitations in explicitly modeling long-range dependency. Transformers, designed for sequence-to-sequence prediction, have emerged as alternative architectures with innate global self-attention mechanisms, but can result in limited localization abilities due to insufficient low-level details. In this paper, we propose TransUNet, which merits both Transformers and U-Net, as a strong alternative for medical image segmentation. On one hand, the Transformer encodes tokenized image patches from a convolution neural network (CNN) feature map as the input sequence for extracting global contexts. On the other hand, the decoder upsamples the encoded features which are then combined with the high-resolution CNN feature maps to enable precise localization. We argue that Transformers can serve as strong encoders for medical image segmentation tasks, with the combination of U-Net to enhance finer details by recovering localized spatial information. TransUNet achieves superior performances to various competing methods on different medical applications including multi-organ segmentation and cardiac segmentation.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework that efficiently bridges a {\\bf Co}nvolutional neural network and a {\\bf Tr}ansformer {\\bf (CoTr)} for accurate 3D medical image segmentation. Under this framework, the CNN is constructed to extract feature representations and an efficient deformable Transformer (DeTrans) is built to model the long-range dependency on the extracted feature maps.

Thus, the computational and spatial complexities of DeTrans have been greatly reduced, making it possible to process the multi-scale and high-resolution feature maps, which are usually of paramount importance for image segmentation. We conduct an extensive evaluation on the Multi-Atlas Labeling Beyond the Cranial Vault (BCV) dataset that covers 11 major human organs.

However, due to the inherent inductive biases present in the convolutional architectures, they lack understanding of long-range dependencies in the image. Recently proposed Transformer-based architectures that leverage self-attention mechanism encode long-range dependencies and learn representations that are highly expressive. This motivates us to explore Transformer-based solutions and study the feasibility of using Transformer-based network architectures for medical image segmentation tasks. Majority of existing Transformer-based network architectures proposed for vision applications require large-scale datasets to train properly. However, compared to the datasets for vision applications, for medical imaging the number of data samples is relatively low, making it difficult to efficiently train transformers for medical applications. To this end, we propose a Gated Axial-Attention model which extends the existing architectures by introducing an additional control mechanism in the self-attention module. Furthermore, to train the model effectively on medical images, we propose a Local-Global training strategy (LoGo) which further improves the performance. Specifically, we operate on the whole image and patches to learn global and local features, respectively.

Past attempts to unify image segmentation in the last decades include scene parsing, panoptic segmentation, and, more recently, new panoptic architectures. However, such panoptic architectures do not truly unify image segmentation because they need to be trained individually on the semantic, instance, or panoptic segmentation to achieve the best performance. Ideally, a truly universal framework should be trained only once and achieve SOTA performance across all three image segmentation tasks. To that end, we propose OneFormer, a universal image segmentation framework that unifies segmentation with a multi-task train-once design. We first propose a task-conditioned joint training strategy that enables training on ground truths of each domain (semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation) within a single multi-task training process. Secondly, we introduce a task token to condition our model on the task at hand, making our model task-dynamic to support multi-task training and inference. Thirdly, we propose using a query-text contrastive loss during training to establish better inter-task and inter-class distinctions. Notably, our single OneFormer model outperforms specialized Mask2Former models across all three segmentation tasks on ADE20k, CityScapes, and COCO, despite the latter being trained on each of the three tasks individually with three times the resources. With new ConvNeXt and DiNAT backbones, we observe even more performance improvement. We believe OneFormer is a significant step towards making image segmentation more universal and accessible.

The ability of capturing short- and long-range visual dependencies through self-attention is arguably the main source for the success. But it also brings challenges due to quadratic computational overhead, especially for the high-resolution vision tasks (e.g., object detection). In this paper, we present focal self-attention, a new mechanism that incorporates both fine-grained local and coarse-grained global interactions. Using this new mechanism, each token attends the closest surrounding tokens at fine granularity but the tokens far away at coarse granularity, and thus can capture both short- and long-range visual dependencies efficiently and effectively. With focal self-attention, we propose a new variant of Vision Transformer models, called Focal Transformer, which achieves superior performance over the state-of-the-art vision Transformers on a range of public image classification and object detection benchmarks. In particular, our Focal Transformer models with a moderate size of 51.1M and a larger size of 89.8M achieve 83.5 and 83.8 Top-1 accuracy, respectively, on ImageNet classification at 224x224 resolution. Using Focal Transformers as the backbones, we obtain consistent and substantial improvements over the current state-of-the-art Swin Transformers for 6 different object detection methods trained with standard 1x and 3x schedules.

By contrast, we make a crucial observation that video segmentation tasks could be generally formulated as the problem of assigning different predicted labels to video tubes (where a tube is obtained by linking segmentation masks along the time axis) and the labels may encode different values depending on the target task. The observation motivates us to develop TubeFormer-DeepLab, a simple and effective video mask transformer model that is widely applicable to multiple video segmentation tasks. TubeFormer-DeepLab directly predicts video tubes with task-specific labels (either pure semantic categories, or both semantic categories and instance identities), which not only significantly simplifies video segmentation models, but also advances state-of-the-art results on multiple video segmentation benchmarks"}

In light of this, we present Locater (local-global context aware Transformer), which augments the Transformer architecture with a finite memory so as to query the entire video with the language expression in an efficient manner. The memory is designed to involve two components -- one for persistently preserving global video content, and one for dynamically gathering local temporal context and segmentation history. Based on the memorized local-global context and the particular content of each frame, Locater holistically and flexibly comprehends the expression as an adaptive query vector for each frame. The vector is used to query the corresponding frame for mask generation. The memory also allows Locater to process videos with linear time complexity and constant size memory, while Transformer-style self-attention computation scales quadratically with sequence length.

More specifically, SEEM is designed with four desiderata: i) Versatility. We introduce a new visual prompt to unify different spatial queries including points, boxes, scribbles and masks, which can further generalize to a different referring image; ii) Compositionality. We learn a joint visual-semantic space between text and visual prompts, which facilitates the dynamic composition of two prompt types required for various segmentation tasks; iii) Interactivity.

Secondly, this paper focuses on supervised and weakly supervised learning approaches, without including unsupervised approaches since they have been introduced in many old surveys and they are not popular currently.

In this paper we introduce Segmenter, a transformer model for semantic segmentation. In contrast to convolution-based methods, our approach allows to model global context already at the first layer and throughout the network. We build on the recent Vision Transformer (ViT) and extend it to semantic segmentation. To do so, we rely on the output embeddings corresponding to image patches and obtain class labels from these embeddings with a point-wise linear decoder or a mask transformer decoder. We leverage models pre-trained for image classification and show that we can fine-tune them on moderate sized datasets available for semantic segmentation. The linear decoder allows to obtain excellent results already, but the performance can be further improved by a mask transformer generating class masks. We conduct an extensive ablation study to show the impact of the different parameters, in particular the performance is better for large models and small patch sizes. Segmenter attains excellent results for semantic segmentation. It outperforms the state of the art on both ADE20K and Pascal Context datasets and is competitive on Cityscapes."}

The community has witnessed the flourish of semantic segmentation convolutional neural networks (CNN) exploiting multi-scale contextual information. Motivated by that the vision transformer (ViT) is powerful in image classification, some semantic segmentation ViTs are recently proposed, most of them attaining impressive results but at a cost of computational economy. In this paper, we succeed in introducing multi-scale representations into semantic segmentation ViT via window attention mechanism and further improves the performance and efficiency. To this end, we introduce large window attention which allows the local window to query a larger area of context window at only a little computation overhead. By regulating the ratio of the context area to the query area, we enable the $\\textit{large window attention}$ to capture the contextual information at multiple scales. Moreover, the framework of spatial pyramid pooling is adopted to collaborate with $\\textit{the large window attention}$, which presents a novel decoder named $\\textbf{la}$rge $\\textbf{win}$dow attention spatial pyramid pooling (LawinASPP) for semantic segmentation ViT.

However, pure Transformer architectures often require a large amount of training data or extra supervision to obtain comparable performance with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To overcome these limitations, we analyze the potential drawbacks when directly borrowing Transformer architectures from NLP. Then we propose a new \\textbf{Convolution-enhanced image Transformer (CeiT)} which combines the advantages of CNNs in extracting low-level features, strengthening locality, and the advantages of Transformers in establishing long-range dependencies. Three modifications are made to the original Transformer: \\textbf{1)} instead of the straightforward tokenization from raw input images, we design an \\textbf{Image-to-Tokens (I2T)} module that extracts patches from generated low-level features; \\textbf{2)} the feed-froward network in each encoder block is replaced with a \\textbf{Locally-enhanced Feed-Forward (LeFF)} layer that promotes the correlation among neighboring tokens in the spatial dimension; \\textbf{3)} a \\textbf{Layer-wise Class token Attention (LCA)} is attached at the top of the Transformer that utilizes the multi-level representations.

Despite their success, the locality of convolutional layers in FCNNs, limits the capability of learning long-range spatial dependencies. Inspired by the recent success of transformers for Natural Language Processing (NLP) in long-range sequence learning, we reformulate the task of volumetric (3D) medical image segmentation as a sequence-to-sequence prediction problem.

However, is the attention mechanism truly an indispensable part of ViT? Can it be replaced by some other alternatives? To demystify the role of attention mechanism, we simplify it into an extremely simple case: ZERO FLOP and ZERO parameter. Concretely, we revisit the shift operation. It does not contain any parameter or arithmetic calculation. The only operation is to exchange a small portion of the channels between neighboring features. Based on this simple operation, we construct a new backbone network, namely ShiftViT, where the attention layers in ViT are substituted by shift operations. Surprisingly, ShiftViT works quite well in several mainstream tasks, e.g., classification, detection, and segmentation. The performance is on par with or even better than the strong baseline Swin Transformer. These results suggest that the attention mechanism might not be the vital factor that makes ViT successful.

In this paper, we propose a multimodal token fusion method (TokenFusion), tailored for transformer-based vision tasks. To effectively fuse multiple modalities, TokenFusion dynamically detects uninformative tokens and substitutes these tokens with projected and aggregated inter-modal features. Residual positional alignment is also adopted to enable explicit utilization of the inter-modal alignments after fusion. The design of TokenFusion allows the transformer to learn correlations among multimodal features, while the single-modal transformer architecture remains largely intact. Extensive experiments are conducted on a variety of homogeneous and heterogeneous modalities and demonstrate that TokenFusion surpasses state-of-the-art methods in three typical vision tasks: multimodal image-to-image translation, RGB-depth semantic segmentation, and 3D object detection with point cloud and images.

In detail, AOT employs an identification mechanism to associate multiple targets into the same high-dimensional embedding space. Thus, we can simultaneously process multiple objects' matching and segmentation decoding as efficiently as processing a single object.

However, the performance of existing medical image segmentation models has been limited by the challenge of obtaining sufficient high-quality labeled data due to the prohibitive data annotation cost. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a new text-augmented medical image segmentation model LViT (Language meets Vision Transformer). In our LViT model, medical text annotation is incorporated to compensate for the quality deficiency in image data. In addition, the text information can guide to generate pseudo labels of improved quality in the semi-supervised learning. We also propose an Exponential Pseudo label Iteration mechanism (EPI) to help the Pixel-Level Attention Module (PLAM) preserve local image features in semi-supervised LViT setting. In our model, LV (Language-Vision) loss is designed to supervise the training of unlabeled images using text information directly. For evaluation, we construct three multimodal medical segmentation datasets (image + text) containing X-rays and CT images. Experimental results show that our proposed LViT has superior segmentation performance in both fully-supervised and semi-supervised setting.

However, their expensive computational cost makes real-time inference impractical. By characterizing attention maps of the network, we identify two key obstacles in AVS models: 1) attention dissipation, corresponding to the over-concentrated attention weights by Softmax within restricted frames, and 2) inefficient, burdensome transformer decoder, caused by narrow focus patterns in early stages. In this paper, we introduce AVESFormer, the first real-time Audio-Visual Efficient Segmentation transformer that achieves fast, efficient and light-weight simultaneously. Our model leverages an efficient prompt query generator to correct the behaviour of cross-attention. Additionally, we propose ELF decoder to bring greater efficiency by facilitating convolutions suitable for local features to reduce computational burdens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our AVESFormer significantly enhances model performance, achieving 79.9% on S4, 57.9% on MS3 and 31.2% on AVSS, outperforming previous state-of-the-art and achieving an excellent trade-off between performance and speed.

Segmentation is so far the most widely investigated medical image processing task, but the various segmentation challenges have typically been organized in isolation, such that algorithm development was driven by the need to tackle a single specific clinical problem. We hypothesized that a method capable of performing well on multiple tasks will generalize well to a previously unseen task and potentially outperform a custom-designed solution. To investigate the hypothesis, we organized the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) - a biomedical image analysis challenge, in which algorithms compete in a multitude of both tasks and modalities. The underlying data set was designed to explore the axis of difficulties typically encountered when dealing with medical images, such as small data sets, unbalanced labels, multi-site data and small objects. The MSD challenge confirmed that algorithms with a consistent good performance on a set of tasks preserved their good average performance on a different set of previously unseen tasks. Moreover, by monitoring the MSD winner for two years, we found that this algorithm continued generalizing well to a wide range of other clinical problems, further confirming our hypothesis. Three main conclusions can be drawn from this study: (1) state-of-the-art image segmentation algorithms are mature, accurate, and generalize well when retrained on unseen tasks; (2) consistent algorithmic performance across multiple tasks is a strong surrogate of algorithmic generalizability; (3) the training of accurate AI segmentation models is now commoditized to non AI experts."}

The popular \"U-shaped\" network architecture has achieved state-of-the-art performance benchmarks on different 2D and 3D semantic segmentation tasks and across various imaging modalities. However, due to the limited kernel size of convolution layers in FCNNs, their performance of modeling long-range information is sub-optimal, and this can lead to deficiencies in the segmentation of tumors with variable sizes. On the other hand, transformer models have demonstrated excellent capabilities in capturing such long-range information in multiple domains, including natural language processing and computer vision. Inspired by the success of vision transformers and their variants, we propose a novel segmentation model termed Swin UNEt TRansformers (Swin UNETR). Specifically, the task of 3D brain tumor semantic segmentation is reformulated as a sequence to sequence prediction problem wherein multi-modal input data is projected into a 1D sequence of embedding and used as an input to a hierarchical Swin transformer as the encoder.

Key challenges of this task are understanding the meaning of complex and ambiguous language expressions and determining the relevant regions in the image with multiple objects by referring to the expression. Recent models have focused on the early fusion with the language features at the intermediate stage of the vision encoder, but these approaches have a limitation that the language features cannot refer to the visual information. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel architecture, Cross-aware early fusion with stage-divided Vision and Language Transformer encoders (CrossVLT), which allows both language and vision encoders to perform the early fusion for improving the ability of the cross-modal context modeling. Unlike previous methods, our method enables the vision and language features to refer to each other's information at each stage to mutually enhance the robustness of both encoders. Furthermore, unlike the conventional scheme that relies solely on the high-level features for the cross-modal alignment, we introduce a feature-based alignment scheme that enables the low-level to high-level features of the vision and language encoders to engage in the cross-modal alignment. By aligning the intermediate cross-modal features in all encoder stages, this scheme leads to effective cross-modal fusion.

In current transformer-based backbones for medical image segmentation, convolutional layers were replaced with pure transformers, or transformers were added to the deepest encoder to learn global context. However, there are mainly two challenges in a scale-wise perspective: (1) intra-scale problem: the existing methods lacked in extracting local-global cues in each scale, which may impact the signal propagation of small objects; (2) inter-scale problem: the existing methods failed to explore distinctive information from multiple scales, which may hinder the representation learning from objects with widely variable size, shape and location. To address these limitations, we propose a novel backbone, namely ScaleFormer, with two appealing designs: (1) A scale-wise intra-scale transformer is designed to couple the CNN-based local features with the transformer-based global cues in each scale, where the row-wise and column-wise global dependencies can be extracted by a lightweight Dual-Axis MSA.

However, recent hybrid-/transformer-based approaches mainly focus on the benefits of transformers in capturing long-range dependency while ignoring the issues of their daunting computational complexity, high training costs, and redundant dependency. In this paper, we propose to employ adaptive pruning to transformers for medical image segmentation and propose a lightweight and effective hybrid network APFormer. To our best knowledge, this is the first work on transformer pruning for medical image analysis tasks. The key features of APFormer mainly are self-supervised self-attention (SSA) to improve the convergence of dependency establishment, Gaussian-prior relative position embedding (GRPE) to foster the learning of position information, and adaptive pruning to eliminate redundant computations and perception information. Specifically, SSA and GRPE consider the well-converged dependency distribution and the Gaussian heatmap distribution separately as the prior knowledge of self-attention and position embedding to ease the training of transformers and lay a solid foundation for the following pruning operation. Then, adaptive transformer pruning, both query-wise and dependency-wise, is performed by adjusting the gate control parameters for both complexity reduction and performance improvement. Extensive experiments on two widely-used datasets demonstrate the prominent segmentation performance of APFormer against the state-of-the-art methods with much fewer parameters and lower GFLOPs. More importantly, we prove, through ablation studies, that adaptive pruning can work as a plug-n-play module for performance improvement on other hybrid-/transformer-based methods.

Based on vision transformers, the recently-developed Associating Objects with Transformers (AOT) approach introduces hierarchical propagation into VOS and has shown promising results. The hierarchical propagation can gradually propagate information from past frames to the current frame and transfer the current frame feature from object-agnostic to object-specific. However, the increase of object-specific information will inevitably lead to the loss of object-agnostic visual information in deep propagation layers. To solve such a problem and further facilitate the learning of visual embeddings, this paper proposes a Decoupling Features in Hierarchical Propagation (DeAOT) approach. Firstly, DeAOT decouples the hierarchical propagation of object-agnostic and object-specific embeddings by handling them in two independent branches. Secondly, to compensate for the additional computation from dual-branch propagation, we propose an efficient module for constructing hierarchical propagation, i.e., Gated Propagation Module, which is carefully designed with single-head attention. Extensive experiments show that DeAOT significantly outperforms AOT in both accuracy and efficiency. On YouTube-VOS, DeAOT can achieve 86.0% at 22.4fps and 82.0% at 53.4fps.

Recent methods have made remarkable advancements in this paradigm by exploiting Transformers as cross-modal decoders, concurrent to the Transformer's overwhelming success in many other vision-language tasks. Adopting a different approach in this work, we show that significantly better cross-modal alignments can be achieved through the early fusion of linguistic and visual features in intermediate layers of a vision Transformer encoder network. By conducting cross-modal feature fusion in the visual feature encoding stage, we can leverage the well-proven correlation modeling power of a Transformer encoder for excavating helpful multi-modal context.

However, in clinical practice, it is not always possible to acquire a complete set of MRIs, and the problem of missing modalities causes severe performance degradation in existing multimodal segmentation methods. In this work, we present the first attempt to exploit the Transformer for multimodal brain tumor segmentation that is robust to any combinatorial subset of available modalities. Concretely, we propose a novel multimodal Medical Transformer (mmFormer) for incomplete multimodal learning with three main components: the hybrid modality-specific encoders that bridge a convolutional encoder and an intra-modal Transformer for both local and global context modeling within each modality; an inter-modal Transformer to build and align the long-range correlations across modalities for modality-invariant features with global semantics corresponding to tumor region; a decoder that performs a progressive up-sampling and fusion with the modality-invariant features to generate robust segmentation. Besides, auxiliary regularizers are introduced in both encoder and decoder to further enhance the model's robustness to incomplete modalities. We conduct extensive experiments on the public BraTS $2018$ dataset for brain tumor segmentation. The results demonstrate that the proposed mmFormer outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for incomplete multimodal brain tumor segmentation on almost all subsets of incomplete modalities, especially by an average 19.07% improvement of Dice on tumor segmentation with only one available modality.

However, CNNs have limited modeling capabilities for long-range dependencies, making it challenging to exploit the semantic information within images fully. On the other hand, the quadratic computational complexity poses a challenge for Transformers. Recently, State Space Models (SSMs), such as Mamba, have been recognized as a promising method. They not only demonstrate superior performance in modeling long-range interactions, but also preserve a linear computational complexity. Inspired by the Mamba architecture, We proposed Vison Mamba-UNetV2, the Visual State Space (VSS) Block is introduced to capture extensive contextual information, the Semantics and Detail Infusion (SDI) is introduced to augment the infusion of low-level and high-level features. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the ISIC17, ISIC18, CVC-300, CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir, CVC-ColonDB and ETIS-LaribPolypDB public datasets.

Inspired by subword tokenization, we introduce subobject-level adaptive token segmentation and explore several approaches, including superpixel, SAM, and a proposed Efficient and PanOptiC (EPOC) image tokenizer. Our EPOC combines boundary detection -- a simple task that can be handled well by a compact model -- with watershed segmentation, which inherently guarantees no pixels are left unsegmented. Intrinsic evaluations across 5 datasets demonstrate that EPOC's segmentation aligns well with human annotations of both object- and part-level visual morphology, producing more monosemantic tokens and offering substantial efficiency advantages. For extrinsic evaluation, we designed a token embedding that handles arbitrary-shaped tokens, and trained VLMs with different tokenizers on 4 datasets of object recognition and detailed captioning. The results reveal that subobject tokenization enables faster convergence and better generalization while using fewer visual tokens."}
{"id": "81", "arxiv": "2303.08131v3", "title": "A Simple Framework for Open-Vocabulary Segmentation and Detection", "abstract": "We present OpenSeeD, a simple Open-vocabulary Segmentation and Detection framework that jointly learns from different segmentation and detection datasets. To bridge the gap of vocabulary and annotation granularity, we first introduce a pre-trained text encoder to encode all the visual concepts in two tasks and learn a common semantic space for them. This gives us reasonably good results compared with the counterparts trained on segmentation task only. To further reconcile them, we locate two discrepancies: $i$) task discrepancy -- segmentation requires extracting masks for both foreground objects and background stuff, while detection merely cares about the former; $ii$) data discrepancy -- box and mask annotations are with different spatial granularity, and thus not directly interchangeable. To address these issues, we propose a decoupled decoding to reduce the interference between foreground/background and a conditioned mask decoding to assist in generating masks for given boxes. To this end, we develop a simple encoder-decoder model encompassing all three techniques and train it jointly on COCO and Objects365. After pre-training, our model exhibits competitive or stronger zero-shot transferability for both segmentation and detection. Specifically, OpenSeeD beats the state-of-the-art method for open-vocabulary instance and panoptic segmentation across 5 datasets, and outperforms previous work for open-vocabulary detection on LVIS and ODinW under similar settings. When transferred to specific tasks, our model achieves new SoTA for panoptic segmentation on COCO and ADE20K, and instance segmentation on ADE20K and Cityscapes. Finally, we note that OpenSeeD is the first to explore the potential of joint training on segmentation and detection, and hope it can be received as a strong baseline for developing a single model for both tasks in open world."}

Typically, ViTs experience a performance decline when processing resolutions different from those seen during training. Our work introduces two key innovations to address this issue. Firstly, we propose a novel module for dynamic resolution adjustment, designed with a single Transformer block, specifically to achieve highly efficient incremental token integration. Secondly, we introduce fuzzy positional encoding in the Vision Transformer to provide consistent positional awareness across multiple resolutions, thereby preventing overfitting to any single training resolution. Our resulting model, ViTAR (Vision Transformer with Any Resolution), demonstrates impressive adaptability, achieving 83.3\\% top-1 accuracy at a 1120x1120 resolution and 80.4\\% accuracy at a 4032x4032 resolution, all while reducing computational costs. ViTAR also shows strong performance in downstream tasks such as instance and semantic segmentation and can easily combined with self-supervised learning techniques like Masked AutoEncoder. Our work provides a cost-effective solution for enhancing the resolution scalability of ViTs, paving the way for more versatile and efficient high-resolution image processing."}

Recently, a new audio-visual segmentation (AVS) task has been introduced, aiming to locate and segment the sounding objects in a given video. This task demands audio-driven pixel-level scene understanding for the first time, posing significant challenges. In this paper, we propose AVSegFormer, a novel framework for AVS tasks that leverages the transformer architecture. Specifically, we introduce audio queries and learnable queries into the transformer decoder, enabling the network to selectively attend to interested visual features. Besides, we present an audio-visual mixer, which can dynamically adjust visual features by amplifying relevant and suppressing irrelevant spatial channels. Additionally, we devise an intermediate mask loss to enhance the supervision of the decoder, encouraging the network to produce more accurate intermediate predictions.

However, both local and global features are crucial for dense prediction tasks, especially for 3D medical image segmentation. In this paper, we for the first time exploit Transformer in 3D CNN for MRI Brain Tumor Segmentation and propose a novel network named TransBTS based on the encoder-decoder structure. To capture the local 3D context information, the encoder first utilizes 3D CNN to extract the volumetric spatial feature maps. Meanwhile, the feature maps are reformed elaborately for tokens that are fed into Transformer for global feature modeling. The decoder leverages the features embedded by Transformer and performs progressive upsampling to predict the detailed segmentation map. Extensive experimental results on both BraTS 2019 and 2020 datasets show that TransBTS achieves comparable or higher results than previous state-of-the-art 3D methods for brain tumor segmentation on 3D MRI scans.

Those benchmarks are representative and commonly used in model development. Our experimental results indicate that while SAM presents remarkable segmentation performance on images from the general domain, its zero-shot segmentation ability remains restricted for out-of-distribution images, e.g., medical images. In addition, SAM exhibits inconsistent zero-shot segmentation performance across different unseen medical domains. For certain structured targets, e.g., blood vessels, the zero-shot segmentation of SAM completely failed. In contrast, a simple fine-tuning of it with a small amount of data could lead to remarkable improvement of the segmentation quality, showing the great potential and feasibility of using fine-tuned SAM to achieve accurate medical image segmentation for a precision diagnostics. Our study indicates the versatility of generalist vision foundation models on medical imaging, and their great potential to achieve desired performance through fine-turning and eventually address the challenges associated with accessing large and diverse medical datasets in support of clinical diagnostics."}

However, existing methods devote to designing specialized architectures or parameters for specific segmentation tasks. These customized design paradigms lead to fragmentation between various segmentation tasks, thus hindering the uniformity of segmentation models. Hence in this paper, we propose FreeSeg, a generic framework to accomplish Unified, Universal and Open-Vocabulary Image Segmentation. FreeSeg optimizes an all-in-one network via one-shot training and employs the same architecture and parameters to handle diverse segmentation tasks seamlessly in the inference procedure. Additionally, adaptive prompt learning facilitates the unified model to capture task-aware and category-sensitive concepts, improving model robustness in multi-task and varied scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that FreeSeg establishes new state-of-the-art results in performance and generalization on three segmentation tasks, which outperforms the best task-specific architectures by a large margin: 5.5% mIoU on semantic segmentation, 17.6% mAP on instance segmentation, 20.1% PQ on panoptic segmentation for the unseen class on COCO."}

Segmentation using multimodality consists of fusing multi-information to improve the segmentation. Recently, deep learning-based approaches have presented the state-of-the-art performance in image classification, segmentation, object detection and tracking tasks. Due to their self-learning and generalization ability over large amounts of data, deep learning recently has also gained great interest in multi-modal medical image segmentation.

Firstly, we introduce the general principle of deep learning and multi-modal medical image segmentation. Secondly, we present different deep learning network architectures, then analyze their fusion strategies and compare their results. The earlier fusion is commonly used, since it's simple and it focuses on the subsequent segmentation network architecture. However, the later fusion gives more attention on fusion strategy to learn the complex relationship between different modalities. In general, compared to the earlier fusion, the later fusion can give more accurate result if the fusion method is effective enough. We also discuss some common problems in medical image segmentation. Finally, we summarize and provide some perspectives on the future research."}

A challenging issue in Transformer design is that global self-attention is very expensive to compute whereas local self-attention often limits the field of interactions of each token. To address this issue, we develop the Cross-Shaped Window self-attention mechanism for computing self-attention in the horizontal and vertical stripes in parallel that form a cross-shaped window, with each stripe obtained by splitting the input feature into stripes of equal width. We provide a mathematical analysis of the effect of the stripe width and vary the stripe width for different layers of the Transformer network which achieves strong modeling capability while limiting the computation cost. We also introduce Locally-enhanced Positional Encoding (LePE), which handles the local positional information better than existing encoding schemes. LePE naturally supports arbitrary input resolutions, and is thus especially effective and friendly for downstream tasks. Incorporated with these designs and a hierarchical structure, CSWin Transformer demonstrates competitive performance on common vision tasks. Specifically, it achieves 85.4\\% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K without any extra training data or label, 53.9 box AP and 46.4 mask AP on the COCO detection task, and 52.2 mIOU on the ADE20K semantic segmentation task, surpassing previous state-of-the-art Swin Transformer backbone by +1.2, +2.0, +1.4, and +2.0 respectively under the similar FLOPs setting.

Their main feature is the capacity to extract global information through the self-attention mechanism, outperforming earlier convolutional neural networks. However, ViT deployment and performance have grown steadily with their size, number of trainable parameters, and operations. Furthermore, self-attention's computational and memory cost quadratically increases with the image resolution. Generally speaking, it is challenging to employ these architectures in real-world applications due to many hardware and environmental restrictions, such as processing and computational capabilities. Therefore, this survey investigates the most efficient methodologies to ensure sub-optimal estimation performances. More in detail, four efficient categories will be analyzed: compact architecture, pruning, knowledge distillation, and quantization strategies. Moreover, a new metric called Efficient Error Rate has been introduced in order to normalize and compare models' features that affect hardware devices at inference time, such as the number of parameters, bits, FLOPs, and model size. Summarizing, this paper firstly mathematically defines the strategies used to make Vision Transformer efficient, describes and discusses state-of-the-art methodologies, and analyzes their performances over different application scenarios.

Beyond the fact that adapting self-supervised methods to this architecture works particularly well, we make the following observations: first, self-supervised ViT features contain explicit information about the semantic segmentation of an image, which does not emerge as clearly with supervised ViTs, nor with convnets. Second, these features are also excellent k-NN classifiers, reaching 78.3% top-1 on ImageNet with a small ViT. Our study also underlines the importance of momentum encoder, multi-crop training, and the use of small patches with ViTs. We implement our findings into a simple self-supervised method, called DINO, which we interpret as a form of self-distillation with no labels. We show the synergy between DINO and ViTs by achieving 80.1% top-1 on ImageNet in linear evaluation with ViT-Base."}

Motivated by the universality of the Multi-layer Transformer architecture (e.g, GPT) widely used in large language models (LLMs), we seek to broaden its scope to serve as a powerful vision foundation model (VFM). However, unlike language modeling, visual tasks typically require specific modules, such as bounding box heads for detection and pixel decoders for segmentation, greatly hindering the application of powerful multi-layer transformers in the vision domain. To solve this, we design a universal language interface that empowers the successful auto-regressive decoding to adeptly unify various visual tasks, from image-level understanding (e.g., captioning), over sparse perception (e.g., detection), to dense prediction (e.g., segmentation). Based on the above designs, the entire model is composed solely of a ViT, without any specific additions, offering a remarkable architectural simplification. GiT is a multi-task visual model, jointly trained across five representative benchmarks without task-specific fine-tuning. Interestingly, our GiT builds a new benchmark in generalist performance, and fosters mutual enhancement across tasks, leading to significant improvements compared to isolated training. This reflects a similar impact observed in LLMs. Further enriching training with 27 datasets, GiT achieves strong zero-shot results over various tasks.

Specifically, the seminal U-Net, as well as its alternatives, have successfully managed to address a wide variety of medical image segmentation tasks. However, these architectures are intrinsically imperfect as they fail to exhibit long-range interactions and spatial dependencies leading to a severe performance drop in the segmentation of medical images with variable shapes and structures. Transformers, preliminary proposed for sequence-to-sequence prediction, have arisen as surrogate architectures to precisely model global information assisted by the self-attention mechanism. Despite being feasibly designed, utilizing a pure Transformer for image segmentation purposes can result in limited localization capacity stemming from inadequate low-level features. Thus, a line of research strives to design robust variants of Transformer-based U-Net. In this paper, we propose Trans-Norm, a novel deep segmentation framework which concomitantly consolidates a Transformer module into both encoder and skip-connections of the standard U-Net. We argue that the expedient design of skip-connections can be crucial for accurate segmentation as it can assist in feature fusion between the expanding and contracting paths. In this respect, we derive a Spatial Normalization mechanism from the Transformer module to adaptively recalibrate the skip connection path. Extensive experiments across three typical tasks for medical image segmentation demonstrate the effectiveness of TransNorm.

To this end, we first propose a cross-scale vision transformer, CrossFormer. It introduces a cross-scale embedding layer (CEL) and a long-short distance attention (LSDA). On the one hand, CEL blends each token with multiple patches of different scales, providing the self-attention module itself with cross-scale features. On the other hand, LSDA splits the self-attention module into a short-distance one and a long-distance counterpart, which not only reduces the computational burden but also keeps both small-scale and large-scale features in the tokens. Moreover, through experiments on CrossFormer, we observe another two issues that affect vision transformers' performance, i.e., the enlarging self-attention maps and amplitude explosion. Thus, we further propose a progressive group size (PGS) paradigm and an amplitude cooling layer (ACL) to alleviate the two issues, respectively. The CrossFormer incorporating with PGS and ACL is called CrossFormer++. Extensive experiments show that CrossFormer++ outperforms the other vision transformers on image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation tasks.

Empirical investigations on the adaptation of existing frameworks to vanilla ViT reveal that incorporating visual adapters into ViTs or fine-tuning ViTs with distillation terms is advantageous for enhancing the segmentation capability of novel classes. These findings motivate us to propose Continual semantic Segmentation via Adapter-based ViT, namely ConSept. Within the simplified architecture of ViT with linear segmentation head, ConSept integrates lightweight attention-based adapters into vanilla ViTs. Capitalizing on the feature adaptation abilities of these adapters, ConSept not only retains superior segmentation ability for old classes, but also attains promising segmentation quality for novel classes. To further harness the intrinsic anti-catastrophic forgetting ability of ConSept and concurrently enhance the segmentation capabilities for both old and new classes, we propose two key strategies: distillation with a deterministic old-classes boundary for improved anti-catastrophic forgetting, and dual dice losses to regularize segmentation maps, thereby improving overall segmentation performance. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of ConSept on multiple continual semantic segmentation benchmarks under overlapped or disjoint settings.

This motivated us for the development of GLIMS, a data-efficient attention-guided hybrid volumetric segmentation network. GLIMS utilizes Dilated Feature Aggregator Convolutional Blocks (DACB) to capture local-global feature correlations efficiently. Furthermore, the incorporated Swin Transformer-based bottleneck bridges the local and global features to improve the robustness of the model.

However, gathering such a corpus is expensive, due to human annotation effort, in contrast to gathering unlabeled data. We propose an active learning-based strategy, called CEREALS, in which a human only has to hand-label a few, automatically selected, regions within an unlabeled image corpus. This minimizes human annotation effort while maximizing the performance of a semantic image segmentation method. The automatic selection procedure is achieved by: a) using a suitable information measure combined with an estimate about human annotation effort, which is inferred from a learned cost model, and b) exploiting the spatial coherency of an image. The performance of CEREALS is demonstrated on Cityscapes, where we are able to reduce the annotation effort to 17%, while keeping 95% of the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of a model that was trained with the fully annotated training set of Cityscapes."}

However, there is a growing interest in reducing these problems to pixel labeling tasks, as the latter could be more efficient, could be integrated seamlessly in image-to-image network architectures as used in many other tasks, and could be more accurate for objects that are not well approximated by bounding boxes. In this paper we show theoretically and empirically that constructing dense pixel embeddings that can separate object instances cannot be easily achieved using convolutional operators. At the same time, we show that simple modifications, which we call semi-convolutional, have a much better chance of succeeding at this task. We use the latter to show a connection to Hough voting as well as to a variant of the bilateral kernel that is spatially steered by a convolutional network. We demonstrate that these operators can also be used to improve approaches such as Mask RCNN, demonstrating better segmentation of complex biological shapes and PASCAL VOC categories than achievable by Mask RCNN alone."}

Previous studies have exploited it only for the backbone network. Unlike previous studies, we explore the capacity of the Metaformer architecture more extensively in the semantic segmentation task. We propose a powerful semantic segmentation network, MetaSeg, which leverages the Metaformer architecture from the backbone to the decoder. Our MetaSeg shows that the MetaFormer architecture plays a significant role in capturing the useful contexts for the decoder as well as for the backbone. In addition, recent segmentation methods have shown that using a CNN-based backbone for extracting the spatial information and a decoder for extracting the global information is more effective than using a transformer-based backbone with a CNN-based decoder. This motivates us to adopt the CNN-based backbone using the MetaFormer block and design our MetaFormer-based decoder, which consists of a novel self-attention module to capture the global contexts. To consider both the global contexts extraction and the computational efficiency of the self-attention for semantic segmentation, we propose a Channel Reduction Attention (CRA) module that reduces the channel dimension of the query and key into the one dimension. In this way, our proposed MetaSeg outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods with more efficient computational costs on popular semantic segmentation and a medical image segmentation benchmark, including ADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-stuff, and Synapse.

In this paper, we propose a novel single-shot box-supervised instance segmentation approach, which integrates the classical level set model with deep neural network delicately. Specifically, our proposed method iteratively learns a series of level sets through a continuous Chan-Vese energy-based function in an end-to-end fashion. A simple mask supervised SOLOv2 model is adapted to predict the instance-aware mask map as the level set for each instance. Both the input image and its deep features are employed as the input data to evolve the level set curves, where a box projection function is employed to obtain the initial boundary. By minimizing the fully differentiable energy function, the level set for each instance is iteratively optimized within its corresponding bounding box annotation.

With the advent of foundation models (FMs), contemporary segmentation methodologies have embarked on a new epoch by either adapting FMs (e.g., CLIP, Stable Diffusion, DINO) for image segmentation or developing dedicated segmentation foundation models (e.g., SAM). These approaches not only deliver superior segmentation performance, but also herald newfound segmentation capabilities previously unseen in deep learning context. However, current research in image segmentation lacks a detailed analysis of distinct characteristics, challenges, and solutions associated with these advancements. This survey seeks to fill this gap by providing a thorough review of cutting-edge research centered around FM-driven image segmentation. We investigate two basic lines of research -- generic image segmentation (i.e., semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, panoptic segmentation), and promptable image segmentation (i.e., interactive segmentation, referring segmentation, few-shot segmentation) -- by delineating their respective task settings, background concepts, and key challenges. Furthermore, we provide insights into the emergence of segmentation knowledge from FMs like CLIP, Stable Diffusion, and DINO. An exhaustive overview of over 300 segmentation approaches is provided to encapsulate the breadth of current research efforts. Subsequently, we engage in a discussion of open issues and potential avenues for future research.

We offer three insights based on simple and easy to implement variants of vision transformers. (1) The residual layers of vision transformers, which are usually processed sequentially, can to some extent be processed efficiently in parallel without noticeably affecting the accuracy. (2) Fine-tuning the weights of the attention layers is sufficient to adapt vision transformers to a higher resolution and to other classification tasks. This saves compute, reduces the peak memory consumption at fine-tuning time, and allows sharing the majority of weights across tasks. (3) Adding MLP-based patch pre-processing layers improves Bert-like self-supervised training based on patch masking. We evaluate the impact of these design choices using the ImageNet-1k dataset, and confirm our findings on the ImageNet-v2 test set. Transfer performance is measured across six smaller datasets."}

The typical framework involves using image-level labels as training data to generate pixel-level pseudo-labels with refinements. Recently, methods based on Vision Transformers (ViT) have demonstrated superior capabilities in generating reliable pseudo-labels, particularly in recognizing complete object regions, compared to CNN methods. However, current ViT-based approaches have some limitations in the use of patch embeddings, being prone to being dominated by certain abnormal patches, as well as many multi-stage methods being time-consuming and lengthy in training, thus lacking efficiency. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a novel ViT-based WSSS method named \\textit{Adaptive Patch Contrast} (APC) that significantly enhances patch embedding learning for improved segmentation effectiveness. APC utilizes an Adaptive-K Pooling (AKP) layer to address the limitations of previous max pooling selection methods. Additionally, we propose a Patch Contrastive Learning (PCL) to enhance patch embeddings, thereby further improving the final results. Furthermore, we improve upon the existing multi-stage training framework without CAM by transforming it into an end-to-end single-stage training approach, thereby enhancing training efficiency. The experimental results show that our approach is effective and efficient, outperforming other state-of-the-art WSSS methods on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 dataset within a shorter training duration."}

However, CNNs exhibit limitations in long-range modeling capabilities, whereas Transformers are hampered by their quadratic computational complexity. Recently, State Space Models (SSMs), exemplified by Mamba, have emerged as a promising approach. They not only excel in modeling long-range interactions but also maintain a linear computational complexity. In this paper, leveraging state space models, we propose a U-shape architecture model for medical image segmentation, named Vision Mamba UNet (VM-UNet). Specifically, the Visual State Space (VSS) block is introduced as the foundation block to capture extensive contextual information, and an asymmetrical encoder-decoder structure is constructed with fewer convolution layers to save calculation cost. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the ISIC17, ISIC18, and Synapse datasets, and the results indicate that VM-UNet performs competitively in medical image segmentation tasks. To our best knowledge, this is the first medical image segmentation model constructed based on the pure SSM-based model.

Two settings are studied with this benchmark: 1) semi-supervised audio-visual segmentation with a single sound source and 2) fully-supervised audio-visual segmentation with multiple sound sources. To deal with the AVS problem, we propose a novel method that uses a temporal pixel-wise audio-visual interaction module to inject audio semantics as guidance for the visual segmentation process. We also design a regularization loss to encourage the audio-visual mapping during training. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on the AVSBench compare our approach to several existing methods from related tasks, demonstrating that the proposed method is promising for building a bridge between the audio and pixel-wise visual semantics.

Models based on convolutional networks (CNN), transformers, and their combinations have been proposed to segment polyps with promising results. However, those approaches have limitations either in modeling the local appearance of the polyps only or lack of multi-level features for spatial dependency in the decoding process. This paper proposes a novel network, namely ColonFormer, to address these limitations. ColonFormer is an encoder-decoder architecture capable of modeling long-range semantic information at both encoder and decoder branches. The encoder is a lightweight architecture based on transformers for modeling global semantic relations at multi scales. The decoder is a hierarchical network structure designed for learning multi-level features to enrich feature representation. Besides, a refinement module is added with a new skip connection technique to refine the boundary of polyp objects in the global map for accurate segmentation. Extensive experiments have been conducted on five popular benchmark datasets for polyp segmentation, including Kvasir, CVC-Clinic DB, CVC-ColonDB, CVC-T, and ETIS-Larib.

Notably, the established COCO benchmark has propelled the development of modern detection and segmentation systems. However, the COCO segmentation benchmark has seen comparatively slow improvement over the last decade. Originally equipped with coarse polygon annotations for thing instances, it gradually incorporated coarse superpixel annotations for stuff regions, which were subsequently heuristically amalgamated to yield panoptic segmentation annotations. These annotations, executed by different groups of raters, have resulted not only in coarse segmentation masks but also in inconsistencies between segmentation types. In this study, we undertake a comprehensive reevaluation of the COCO segmentation annotations. By enhancing the annotation quality and expanding the dataset to encompass 383K images with more than 5.18M panoptic masks, we introduce COCONut, the COCO Next Universal segmenTation dataset. COCONut harmonizes segmentation annotations across semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation with meticulously crafted high-quality masks, and establishes a robust benchmark for all segmentation tasks. To our knowledge, COCONut stands as the inaugural large-scale universal segmentation dataset, verified by human raters. We anticipate that the release of COCONut will significantly contribute to the community's ability to assess the progress of novel neural networks."}

Within the transformer models, the self-attention mechanism is one of the main building blocks that strives to capture long-range dependencies. However, the self-attention operation has quadratic complexity which proves to be a computational bottleneck, especially in volumetric medical imaging, where the inputs are 3D with numerous slices. In this paper, we propose a 3D medical image segmentation approach, named UNETR++, that offers both high-quality segmentation masks as well as efficiency in terms of parameters, compute cost, and inference speed. The core of our design is the introduction of a novel efficient paired attention (EPA) block that efficiently learns spatial and channel-wise discriminative features using a pair of inter-dependent branches based on spatial and channel attention. Our spatial attention formulation is efficient having linear complexity with respect to the input sequence length. To enable communication between spatial and channel-focused branches, we share the weights of query and key mapping functions that provide a complimentary benefit (paired attention), while also reducing the overall network parameters. Our extensive evaluations on five benchmarks, Synapse, BTCV, ACDC, BRaTs, and Decathlon-Lung, reveal the effectiveness of our contributions in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.

Although these architectures offer powerful capabilities irrespective of specific segmentation tasks, their use of computational resources can be taxing on deployed devices. One way to overcome this challenge is by adapting the computation level to the specific needs of the input image rather than the current one-size-fits-all approach. To this end, we introduce ECO-M2F or EffiCient TransfOrmer Encoders for Mask2Former-style models. Noting that the encoder module of M2F-style models incur high resource-intensive computations, ECO-M2F provides a strategy to self-select the number of hidden layers in the encoder, conditioned on the input image. To enable this self-selection ability for providing a balance between performance and computational efficiency, we present a three step recipe. The first step is to train the parent architecture to enable early exiting from the encoder. The second step is to create an derived dataset of the ideal number of encoder layers required for each training example. The third step is to use the aforementioned derived dataset to train a gating network that predicts the number of encoder layers to be used, conditioned on the input image. Additionally, to change the computational-accuracy tradeoff, only steps two and three need to be repeated which significantly reduces retraining time. Experiments on the public datasets show that the proposed approach reduces expected encoder computational cost while maintaining performance, adapts to various user compute resources, is flexible in architecture configurations, and can be extended beyond the segmentation task to object detection."}

This is mainly because generic category-specified VS tasks need to detect all objects and track them across consecutive frames, while prompt-guided VS tasks require re-identifying the target with visual/text prompts throughout the entire video, making it hard to handle the different tasks with the same architecture. We make an attempt to address these issues and present a novel unified VS architecture, namely UniVS, by using prompts as queries. UniVS averages the prompt features of the target from previous frames as its initial query to explicitly decode masks, and introduces a target-wise prompt cross-attention layer in the mask decoder to integrate prompt features in the memory pool. By taking the predicted masks of entities from previous frames as their visual prompts, UniVS converts different VS tasks into prompt-guided target segmentation, eliminating the heuristic inter-frame matching process. Our framework not only unifies the different VS tasks but also naturally achieves universal training and testing, ensuring robust performance across different scenarios. UniVS shows a commendable balance between performance and universality on 10 challenging VS benchmarks, covering video instance, semantic, panoptic, object, and referring segmentation tasks.

Our experiments on two widely used medical image segmentation benchmarks (i.e., Synapse Multi-organ, ACDC) demonstrate the superior performance of MERIT over state-of-the-art methods. Our MERIT architecture and MUTATION loss aggregation can be used with downstream medical image and semantic segmentation tasks."}
{"id": "130", "arxiv": "2109.04335v3", "title": "UCTransNet: Rethinking the Skip Connections in U-Net from a Channel-wise Perspective with Transformer", "abstract": "Most recent semantic segmentation methods adopt a U-Net framework with an encoder-decoder architecture. It is still challenging for U-Net with a simple skip connection scheme to model the global multi-scale context: 1) Not each skip connection setting is effective due to the issue of incompatible feature sets of encoder and decoder stage, even some skip connection negatively influence the segmentation performance; 2) The original U-Net is worse than the one without any skip connection on some datasets. Based on our findings, we propose a new segmentation framework, named UCTransNet (with a proposed CTrans module in U-Net), from the channel perspective with attention mechanism. Specifically, the CTrans module is an alternate of the U-Net skip connections, which consists of a sub-module to conduct the multi-scale Channel Cross fusion with Transformer (named CCT) and a sub-module Channel-wise Cross-Attention (named CCA) to guide the fused multi-scale channel-wise information to effectively connect to the decoder features for eliminating the ambiguity. Hence, the proposed connection consisting of the CCT and CCA is able to replace the original skip connection to solve the semantic gaps for an accurate automatic medical image segmentation. The experimental results suggest that our UCTransNet produces more precise segmentation performance and achieves consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art for semantic segmentation across different datasets and conventional architectures involving transformer or U-shaped framework.

In the field of medical image analysis, Transformers have also been successfully applied to full-stack clinical applications, including image synthesis/reconstruction, registration, segmentation, detection, and diagnosis. Our paper aims to promote awareness and application of Transformers in the field of medical image analysis. Specifically, we first overview the core concepts of the attention mechanism built into Transformers and other basic components. Second, we review various Transformer architectures tailored for medical image applications and discuss their limitations. Within this review, we investigate key challenges revolving around the use of Transformers in different learning paradigms, improving the model efficiency, and their coupling with other techniques. We hope this review can give a comprehensive picture of Transformers to the readers in the field of medical image analysis."}
{"id": "132", "arxiv": "1904.10917v1", "title": "The iterative convolution-thresholding method (ICTM) for image segmentation", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel iterative convolution-thresholding method (ICTM) that is applicable to a range of variational models for image segmentation. A variational model usually minimizes an energy functional consisting of a fidelity term and a regularization term. In the ICTM, the interface between two different segment domains is implicitly represented by their characteristic functions. The fidelity term is then usually written as a linear functional of the characteristic functions and the regularized term is approximated by a functional of characteristic functions in terms of heat kernel convolution. This allows us to design an iterative convolution-thresholding method to minimize the approximate energy. The method is simple, efficient and enjoys the energy-decaying property. Numerical experiments show that the method is easy to implement, robust and applicable to various image segmentation models."}
{"id": "133", "arxiv": "2301.11798v2", "title": "MedSegDiff-V2: Diffusion based Medical Image Segmentation with Transformer", "abstract": "The Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) has recently gained popularity in the field of computer vision, thanks to its image generation applications, such as Imagen, Latent Diffusion Models, and Stable Diffusion, which have demonstrated impressive capabilities and sparked much discussion within the community. Recent investigations have further unveiled the utility of DPM in the domain of medical image analysis, as underscored by the commendable performance exhibited by the medical image segmentation model across various tasks. Although these models were originally underpinned by a UNet architecture, there exists a potential avenue for enhancing their performance through the integration of vision transformer mechanisms. However, we discovered that simply combining these two models resulted in subpar performance. To effectively integrate these two cutting-edge techniques for the Medical image segmentation, we propose a novel Transformer-based Diffusion framework, called MedSegDiff-V2. We verify its effectiveness on 20 medical image segmentation tasks with different image modalities. Through comprehensive evaluation, our approach demonstrates superiority over prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) methodologies. Code is released at https://github.com/KidsWithTokens/MedSegDiff"}
