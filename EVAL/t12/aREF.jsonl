Semantic segmentation is a widely used perception method for self-driving cars that associates each pixel of an image with a predefined class. In this context, several segmentation models are evaluated regarding accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results on the generated dataset confirm that the segmentation model FasterSeg is fast enough to be used in realtime on lowpower computational (embedded) devices in self-driving cars. A simple method is also introduced to generate synthetic training data for the model. Moreover, the accuracy of the first-person perspective and the bird's eye view perspective are compared. For a $320 \\times 256$ input in the first-person perspective, FasterSeg achieves $65.44\\,\\%$ mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), and for a $320 \\times 256$ input from the bird's eye view perspective, FasterSeg achieves $64.08\\,\\%$ mIoU. Both perspectives achieve a frame rate of $247.11$ Frames per Second (FPS) on the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier.

Given the immense dimensions of whole slide images (WSI) in histology, deep learning approaches for WSI classification mainly operate at patch-wise or superpixel-wise level. However, these solutions often struggle to capture global WSI information and cannot directly generate the binary mask. Downsampling the WSI and performing semantic segmentation is another possible approach. While this method offers computational efficiency, it necessitates a large amount of annotated data since resolution reduction may lead to information loss. Visual prompting is a novel paradigm that allows the model to perform new tasks by making subtle modifications to the input space, rather than adapting the model itself. Such approach has demonstrated promising results on many computer vision tasks. In this paper, we show the efficacy of visual prompting in the context of tumor segmentation for three distinct organs. In comparison to classical methods trained for this specific task, our findings reveal that, with appropriate prompt examples, visual prompting can achieve comparable or better performance without extensive fine-tuning."}

Among their salient benefits, Transformers enable modeling long dependencies between input sequence elements and support parallel processing of sequence as compared to recurrent networks e.g., Long short-term memory (LSTM). Different from convolutional networks, Transformers require minimal inductive biases for their design and are naturally suited as set-functions. Furthermore, the straightforward design of Transformers allows processing multiple modalities (e.g., images, videos, text and speech) using similar processing blocks and demonstrates excellent scalability to very large capacity networks and huge datasets. These strengths have led to exciting progress on a number of vision tasks using Transformer networks. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the Transformer models in the computer vision discipline. We start with an introduction to fundamental concepts behind the success of Transformers i.e., self-attention, large-scale pre-training, and bidirectional encoding. We then cover extensive applications of transformers in vision including popular recognition tasks (e.g., image classification, object detection, action recognition, and segmentation), generative modeling, multi-modal tasks (e.g., visual-question answering, visual reasoning, and visual grounding), video processing (e.g., activity recognition, video forecasting), low-level vision (e.g., image super-resolution, image enhancement, and colorization) and 3D analysis (e.g., point cloud classification and segmentation). We compare the respective advantages and limitations of popular techniques both in terms of architectural design and their experimental value.

However, directly training the vision transformers may yield unstable and sub-optimal results. Recent works propose to improve the performance of the vision transformers by modifying the transformer structures, e.g., incorporating convolution layers. In contrast, we investigate an orthogonal approach to stabilize the vision transformer training without modifying the networks. We observe the instability of the training can be attributed to the significant similarity across the extracted patch representations. More specifically, for deep vision transformers, the self-attention blocks tend to map different patches into similar latent representations, yielding information loss and performance degradation. To alleviate this problem, in this work, we introduce novel loss functions in vision transformer training to explicitly encourage diversity across patch representations for more discriminative feature extraction. We empirically show that our proposed techniques stabilize the training and allow us to train wider and deeper vision transformers. We further show the diversified features significantly benefit the downstream tasks in transfer learning.

However, the self-attention mechanism, large number of parameters, and the requirement for a substantial amount of training data still make Vision Transformers computationally burdensome. In this research, we investigate the possibility of applying Sparse Regularization to Vision Transformers and the impact of Pruning, either after Sparse Regularization or without it, on the trade-off between performance and efficiency. To accomplish this, we apply Sparse Regularization and Pruning methods to the Vision Transformer architecture for image classification tasks on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100 datasets. The training process for the Vision Transformer model consists of two parts: pre-training and fine-tuning. Pre-training utilizes ImageNet21K data, followed by fine-tuning for 20 epochs. The results show that when testing with CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-100 data, models with Sparse Regularization can increase accuracy by 0.12%. Furthermore, applying pruning to models with Sparse Regularization yields even better results.

Many variant models based on deep learning structures have achieved even better performances. Attention-based architectures have become almost ubiquitous in deep learning structures. Especially, the transformer model has now defeated the convolutional neural network in image classification tasks to become the most widely used tool. However, the theoretical properties of attention-based models are seldom considered. In this work, we show that with suitable adaptations, the single-head self-attention transformer with a fixed number of transformer encoder blocks and free parameters is able to generate any desired polynomial of the input with no error. The number of transformer encoder blocks is the same as the degree of the target polynomial. Even more exciting, we find that these transformer encoder blocks in this model do not need to be trained. As a direct consequence, we show that the single-head self-attention transformer with increasing numbers of free parameters is universal. These surprising theoretical results clearly explain the outstanding performances of the transformer model and may shed light on future modifications in real applications. We also provide some experiments to verify our theoretical result."}

We interpret the original self-attention as a simple graph filter and redesign it from a graph signal processing (GSP) perspective. We propose a graph-filter-based self-attention (GFSA) to learn a general yet effective one, whose complexity, however, is slightly larger than that of the original self-attention mechanism.

In this paper, we show that, unlike convolution neural networks (CNNs)that can be improved by stacking more convolutional layers, the performance of ViTs saturate fast when scaled to be deeper. More specifically, we empirically observe that such scaling difficulty is caused by the attention collapse issue: as the transformer goes deeper, the attention maps gradually become similar and even much the same after certain layers. In other words, the feature maps tend to be identical in the top layers of deep ViT models. This fact demonstrates that in deeper layers of ViTs, the self-attention mechanism fails to learn effective concepts for representation learning and hinders the model from getting expected performance gain. Based on above observation, we propose a simple yet effective method, named Re-attention, to re-generate the attention maps to increase their diversity at different layers with negligible computation and memory cost. The pro-posed method makes it feasible to train deeper ViT models with consistent performance improvements via minor modification to existing ViT models. Notably, when training a deep ViT model with 32 transformer blocks, the Top-1 classification accuracy can be improved by 1.6% on ImageNet.

However, due to the quadratic time and memory complexity of self-attention, which is proportional to the number of input tokens, most existing Vision Transformers (ViTs) encounter challenges in achieving efficient performance in practical industrial deployment scenarios, such as TensorRT and CoreML, where traditional CNNs excel. Although some recent attempts have been made to design CNN-Transformer hybrid architectures to tackle this problem, their overall performance has not met expectations. To tackle these challenges, we propose an efficient hybrid ViT architecture named FMViT. This approach enhances the model's expressive power by blending high-frequency features and low-frequency features with varying frequencies, enabling it to capture both local and global information effectively. Additionally, we introduce deploy-friendly mechanisms such as Convolutional Multigroup Reparameterization (gMLP), Lightweight Multi-head Self-Attention (RLMHSA), and Convolutional Fusion Block (CFB) to further improve the model's performance and reduce computational overhead.

Yet, relatively limited well-annotated medical image data makes transformers struggle to extract diverse global features, resulting in attention collapse where attention maps become similar or even identical. Comparatively, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have better convergence properties on small-scale training data but suffer from limited receptive fields. Existing works are dedicated to exploring the combinations of CNN and transformers while ignoring attention collapse, leaving the potential of transformers under-explored. In this paper, we propose to build CNN-style Transformers (ConvFormer) to promote better attention convergence and thus better segmentation performance. Specifically, ConvFormer consists of pooling, CNN-style self-attention (CSA), and convolutional feed-forward network (CFFN) corresponding to tokenization, self-attention, and feed-forward network in vanilla vision transformers. In contrast to positional embedding and tokenization, ConvFormer adopts 2D convolution and max-pooling for both position information preservation and feature size reduction. In this way, CSA takes 2D feature maps as inputs and establishes long-range dependency by constructing self-attention matrices as convolution kernels with adaptive sizes. Following CSA, 2D convolution is utilized for feature refinement through CFFN. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ConvFormer working as a plug-and-play module for consistent performance improvement of transformer-based frameworks.

Yet vanilla Transformers are notoriously resource-expensive, requiring $O(L^2)$ in serial time and memory as functions of input length $L$. Recent works proposed various linear self-attention mechanisms, scaling only as $O(L)$ for serial computation. We perform a thorough analysis of recent Transformer mechanisms with linear self-attention, Performers, in terms of overall computational complexity. We observe a remarkable computational flexibility: forward and backward propagation can be performed with no approximations using sublinear memory as a function of $L$ (in addition to negligible storage for the input sequence), at a cost of greater time complexity in the parallel setting. In the extreme case, a Performer consumes only $O(1)$ memory during training, and still requires $O(L)$ time. This discovered time-memory tradeoff can be used for training or, due to complete backward-compatibility, for fine-tuning on a low-memory device, e.g. a smartphone or an earlier-generation GPU, thus contributing towards decentralized and democratized deep learning."}

However, there are mainly two challenges in a scale-wise perspective: (1) intra-scale problem: the existing methods lacked in extracting local-global cues in each scale, which may impact the signal propagation of small objects; (2) inter-scale problem: the existing methods failed to explore distinctive information from multiple scales, which may hinder the representation learning from objects with widely variable size, shape and location. To address these limitations, we propose a novel backbone, namely ScaleFormer, with two appealing designs: (1) A scale-wise intra-scale transformer is designed to couple the CNN-based local features with the transformer-based global cues in each scale, where the row-wise and column-wise global dependencies can be extracted by a lightweight Dual-Axis MSA. (2) A simple and effective spatial-aware inter-scale transformer is designed to interact among consensual regions in multiple scales, which can highlight the cross-scale dependency and resolve the complex scale variations. Experimental results on different benchmarks demonstrate that our Scale-Former outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.

Traditionally, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) dominated this domain, excelling at local feature extraction. However, their limitations in capturing long-range dependencies across image regions pose challenges for segmenting complex, interconnected structures often encountered in medical data. In recent years, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a promising technique for addressing the challenges in medical image segmentation. Their multi-scale attention mechanism enables effective modeling of long-range dependencies between distant structures, crucial for segmenting organs or lesions spanning the image. Additionally, ViTs' ability to discern subtle pattern heterogeneity allows for the precise delineation of intricate boundaries and edges, a critical aspect of accurate medical image segmentation. However, they do lack image-related inductive bias and translational invariance, potentially impacting their performance. Recently, researchers have come up with various ViT-based approaches that incorporate CNNs in their architectures, known as Hybrid Vision Transformers (HVTs) to capture local correlation in addition to the global information in the images. This survey paper provides a detailed review of the recent advancements in ViTs and HVTs for medical image segmentation. Along with the categorization of ViT and HVT-based medical image segmentation approaches, we also present a detailed overview of their real-time applications in several medical image modalities.

Transformers has been applied to natural language related tasks and achieved promising results. However, its applications in visual related tasks are far from being satisfying. Taking into consideration of both the weaknesses of Convolutional Neural Networks and those of the Transformers, in this paper, we consider the use of self-attention for discriminative visual tasks, object detection, as an alternative to convolutions.

In vision, on top of ongoing efforts into plain transformers, hierarchical transformers have also gained significant attention, thanks to their performance and easy integration into existing frameworks. These models typically employ localized attention mechanisms, such as the sliding-window Neighborhood Attention (NA) or Swin Transformer's Shifted Window Self Attention. While effective at reducing self attention's quadratic complexity, local attention weakens two of the most desirable properties of self attention: long range inter-dependency modeling, and global receptive field. In this paper, we introduce Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA), a natural, flexible and efficient extension to NA that can capture more global context and expand receptive fields exponentially at no additional cost. NA's local attention and DiNA's sparse global attention complement each other, and therefore we introduce Dilated Neighborhood Attention Transformer (DiNAT), a new hierarchical vision transformer built upon both. DiNAT variants enjoy significant improvements over strong baselines such as NAT, Swin, and ConvNeXt. Our large model is faster and ahead of its Swin counterpart by 1.6% box AP in COCO object detection, 1.4% mask AP in COCO instance segmentation, and 1.4% mIoU in ADE20K semantic segmentation.

For the low-level features, we introduce Convolutional Self-Attention (CSA). Unlike previous approaches of merging convolution and self-attention, CSA introduces local self-attention into the convolution within a kernel of size 3x3 to enrich low-level features in the first stage of LVT. For the high-level features, we propose Recursive Atrous Self-Attention (RASA), which utilizes the multi-scale context when calculating the similarity map and a recursive mechanism to increase the representation capability with marginal extra parameter cost.

The large, sometimes even global, receptive field endows Transformer models with higher representation power over their CNN counterparts. Nevertheless, simply enlarging receptive field also gives rise to several concerns. On the one hand, using dense attention e.g., in ViT, leads to excessive memory and computational cost, and features can be influenced by irrelevant parts which are beyond the region of interests. On the other hand, the sparse attention adopted in PVT or Swin Transformer is data agnostic and may limit the ability to model long range relations. To mitigate these issues, we propose a novel deformable self-attention module, where the positions of key and value pairs in self-attention are selected in a data-dependent way. This flexible scheme enables the self-attention module to focus on relevant regions and capture more informative features.

Multiple solutions rely on token pruning or token merging. In this paper, we introduce \"Token Fusion\" (ToFu), a method that amalgamates the benefits of both token pruning and token merging. Token pruning proves advantageous when the model exhibits sensitivity to input interpolations, while token merging is effective when the model manifests close to linear responses to inputs. We combine this to propose a new scheme called Token Fusion. Moreover, we tackle the limitations of average merging, which doesn't preserve the intrinsic feature norm, resulting in distributional shifts. To mitigate this, we introduce MLERP merging, a variant of the SLERP technique, tailored to merge multiple tokens while maintaining the norm distribution. ToFu is versatile, applicable to ViTs with or without additional training.

Recent efforts try to reduce the computation complexity of ViT through network architecture search or hybrid design with MobileNet block, yet the inference speed is still unsatisfactory. This leads to an important question: can transformers run as fast as MobileNet while obtaining high performance? To answer this, we first revisit the network architecture and operators used in ViT-based models and identify inefficient designs. Then we introduce a dimension-consistent pure transformer (without MobileNet blocks) as a design paradigm. Finally, we perform latency-driven slimming to get a series of final models dubbed EfficientFormer.

Dealing with diverse ViT structural components, we derive a novel Hessian-based structural pruning criteria comparable across all layers and structures, with latency-aware regularization for direct latency reduction. Performing iterative pruning on the DeiT-Base model leads to a new architecture family called NViT (Novel ViT), with a novel parameter redistribution that utilizes parameters more efficiently.

We leverage models pre-trained for image classification and show that we can fine-tune them on moderate sized datasets available for semantic segmentation. The linear decoder allows to obtain excellent results already, but the performance can be further improved by a mask transformer generating class masks. We conduct an extensive ablation study to show the impact of the different parameters, in particular the performance is better for large models and small patch sizes.

However, we observe that most existing transformer-based vision models simply borrow the idea from NLP, neglecting the crucial difference between languages and images, particularly the extremely large sequence length of spatially flattened pixel features. This subsequently impedes the learning in cross-attention between pixel features and object queries. In this paper, we rethink the relationship between pixels and object queries and propose to reformulate the cross-attention learning as a clustering process.

It surmounts the key challenge of high computational complexity by performing local self-attention within shifted windows. In this work we propose the Semantic-Aware Local-Global Vision Transformer (SALG), to further investigate two potential improvements towards Swin Transformer. First, unlike Swin Transformer that performs uniform partition to produce equal size of regular windows for local self-attention, our SALG performs semantic segmentation in an unsupervised way to explore the underlying semantic priors in the image. As a result, each segmented region can correspond to a semantically meaningful part in the image, potentially leading to more effective features within each of segmented regions. Second, instead of only performing local self-attention within local windows as Swin Transformer does, the proposed SALG performs both 1) local intra-region self-attention for learning fine-grained features within each region and 2) global inter-region feature propagation for modeling global dependencies among all regions. Consequently, our model is able to obtain the global view when learning features for each token, which is the essential advantage of Transformer. Owing to the explicit modeling of the semantic priors and the proposed local-global modeling mechanism, our SALG is particularly advantageous for small-scale models when the modeling capacity is not sufficient for other models to learn semantics implicitly. Extensive experiments across various vision tasks demonstrates the merit of our model over other vision Transformers, especially in the small-scale modeling scenarios."}

However, convolutions treat all image pixels equally regardless of importance; explicitly model all concepts across all images, regardless of content; and struggle to relate spatially-distant concepts. In this work, we challenge this paradigm by (a) representing images as semantic visual tokens and (b) running transformers to densely model token relationships. Critically, our Visual Transformer operates in a semantic token space, judiciously attending to different image parts based on context. This is in sharp contrast to pixel-space transformers that require orders-of-magnitude more compute. Using an advanced training recipe, our VTs significantly outperform their convolutional counterparts, raising ResNet accuracy on ImageNet top-1 by 4.6 to 7 points while using fewer FLOPs and parameters. For semantic segmentation on LIP and COCO-stuff, VT-based feature pyramid networks (FPN) achieve 0.35 points higher mIoU while reducing the FPN module's FLOPs by 6.5x."}

Nevertheless, vision transformers treat an image as 1D sequence of visual tokens, lacking an intrinsic inductive bias (IB) in modeling local visual structures and dealing with scale variance. Alternatively, they require large-scale training data and longer training schedules to learn the IB implicitly. In this paper, we propose a novel Vision Transformer Advanced by Exploring intrinsic IB from convolutions, ie, ViTAE. Technically, ViTAE has several spatial pyramid reduction modules to downsample and embed the input image into tokens with rich multi-scale context by using multiple convolutions with different dilation rates. In this way, it acquires an intrinsic scale invariance IB and is able to learn robust feature representation for objects at various scales. Moreover, in each transformer layer, ViTAE has a convolution block in parallel to the multi-head self-attention module, whose features are fused and fed into the feed-forward network. Consequently, it has the intrinsic locality IB and is able to learn local features and global dependencies collaboratively. Experiments on ImageNet as well as downstream tasks prove the superiority of ViTAE over the baseline transformer and concurrent works. Source code and pretrained models will be available at GitHub."}

As the computation cost of their self-attention mechanism is expensive, recent works tried to replace the self-attention mechanism in vision transformers with convolutional operations, which is more efficient with built-in inductive bias. However, these efforts either ignore multi-level features or lack dynamic prosperity, leading to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Multi-level Attention mechanism (DMA), which captures different patterns of input images by multiple kernel sizes and enables input-adaptive weights with a gating mechanism. Based on DMA, we present an efficient backbone network named DMFormer. DMFormer adopts the overall architecture of vision transformers, while replacing the self-attention mechanism with our proposed DMA. Extensive experimental results on ImageNet-1K and ADE20K datasets demonstrated that DMFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, which outperforms similar-sized vision transformers(ViTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs)."}

However, the static nature of conventional convolution prevents it from dynamically adapting to input variations, resulting in a representation discrepancy between convolution and self-attention as the latter computes attention maps dynamically. Furthermore, when stacking token mixers that consist of convolution and self-attention to form a deep network, the static nature of convolution hinders the fusion of features previously generated by self-attention into convolution kernels. These two limitations result in a sub-optimal representation capacity of the entire network. To find a solution, we propose a lightweight Dual Dynamic Token Mixer (D-Mixer) to simultaneously learn global and local dynamics via computing input-dependent global and local aggregation weights. D-Mixer works by applying an efficient global attention module and an input-dependent depthwise convolution separately on evenly split feature segments, endowing the network with strong inductive bias and an enlarged receptive field. We use D-Mixer as the basic building block to design TransXNet, a novel hybrid CNN-Transformer vision backbone network that delivers compelling performance. In the ImageNet-1K classification, TransXNet-T surpasses Swin-T by 0.3% in top-1 accuracy while requiring less than half of the computational cost. Furthermore, TransXNet-S and TransXNet-B exhibit excellent model scalability, achieving top-1 accuracy of 83.8% and 84.6% respectively, with reasonable computational costs.

These models, however, usually suffer from intensive computational costs and heavy memory requirements, making them impractical for deployment on edge platforms. Recent studies have proposed to prune transformers in an unexplainable manner, which overlook the relationship between internal units of the model and the target class, thereby leading to inferior performance. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel explainable pruning framework dubbed X-Pruner, which is designed by considering the explainability of the pruning criterion. Specifically, to measure each prunable unit's contribution to predicting each target class, a novel explainability-aware mask is proposed and learned in an end-to-end manner. Then, to preserve the most informative units and learn the layer-wise pruning rate, we adaptively search the layer-wise threshold that differentiates between unpruned and pruned units based on their explainability-aware mask values. To verify and evaluate our method, we apply the X-Pruner on representative transformer models including the DeiT and Swin Transformer. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed X-Pruner outperforms the state-of-the-art black-box methods with significantly reduced computational costs and slight performance degradation."}

We balance the model performance and efficiency of HRViT by various branch-block co-optimization techniques. Specifically, we explore heterogeneous branch designs, reduce the redundancy in linear layers, and augment the attention block with enhanced expressiveness. Those approaches enabled HRViT to push the Pareto frontier of performance and efficiency on semantic segmentation to a new level, as our evaluation results on ADE20K and Cityscapes show. HRViT achieves 50.20% mIoU on ADE20K and 83.16% mIoU on Cityscapes, surpassing state-of-the-art MiT and CSWin backbones with an average of +1.78 mIoU improvement, 28% parameter saving, and 21% FLOPs reduction, demonstrating the potential of HRViT as a strong vision backbone for semantic segmentation."}

The state of the art has focused on conventional RGB video data acquired during minimally invasive surgery, but full-scene semantic segmentation based on spectral imaging data and obtained during open surgery has received almost no attention to date. To address this gap in the literature, we are investigating the following research questions based on hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data of pigs acquired in an open surgery setting: (1) What is an adequate representation of HSI data for neural network-based fully automated organ segmentation, especially with respect to the spatial granularity of the data (pixels vs. superpixels vs. patches vs. full images)? (2) Is there a benefit of using HSI data compared to other modalities, namely RGB data and processed HSI data (e.g. tissue parameters like oxygenation), when performing semantic organ segmentation? According to a comprehensive validation study based on 506 HSI images from 20 pigs, annotated with a total of 19 classes, deep learning-based segmentation performance increases, consistently across modalities, with the spatial context of the input data. Unprocessed HSI data offers an advantage over RGB data or processed data from the camera provider, with the advantage increasing with decreasing size of the input to the neural network. Maximum performance (HSI applied to whole images) yielded a mean DSC of 0.90 ((standard deviation (SD)) 0.04), which is in the range of the inter-rater variability (DSC of 0.89 ((standard deviation (SD)) 0.07)). We conclude that HSI could become a powerful image modality for fully-automatic surgical scene understanding with many advantages over traditional imaging, including the ability to recover additional functional tissue information.

At their heart, there is a Self-Attention (SA) mechanism, an inductive bias that associates each token in the input with every other token through a weighted basis. The standard SA mechanism has quadratic complexity with the sequence length, which impedes its utility to long sequences appearing in high resolution vision. Recently, inspired by operator learning for PDEs, Adaptive Fourier Neural Operators (AFNO) were introduced for high resolution attention based on global convolution that is efficiently implemented via FFT. However, the AFNO global filtering cannot well represent small and moderate scale structures that commonly appear in natural images. To leverage the coarse-to-fine scale structures we introduce a Multiscale Wavelet Attention (MWA) by leveraging wavelet neural operators which incurs linear complexity in the sequence size. We replace the attention in ViT with MWA and our experiments with CIFAR and Tiny-ImageNet classification demonstrate significant improvement over alternative Fourier-based attentions such as AFNO and Global Filter Network (GFN)."}

The broad attention is implemented by broad connection and parameter-free attention. Broad connection of each transformer layer promotes the transmission and integration of information for BViT. Without introducing additional trainable parameters, parameter-free attention jointly focuses on the already available attention information in different layers for extracting useful information and building their relationship. Experiments on image classification tasks demonstrate that BViT delivers state-of-the-art accuracy of 74.8\\%/81.6\\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with 5M/22M parameters.

The network employs a bipartite structure that enables long-range interactions across the image, while maintaining computation of linear efficiency, that can readily scale to high-resolution synthesis. It iteratively propagates information from a set of latent variables to the evolving visual features and vice versa, to support the refinement of each in light of the other and encourage the emergence of compositional representations of objects and scenes. In contrast to the classic transformer architecture, it utilizes multiplicative integration that allows flexible region-based modulation, and can thus be seen as a generalization of the successful StyleGAN network.

The advantage of video segmentation approaches compared to single image segmentation is that temporal image information is considered, and their performance increases due to this. Hence, single image segmentation approaches are extended by recurrent units such as convolutional LSTM (convLSTM) cells, which are placed at suitable positions in the basic network architecture. However, a major critique of video segmentation approaches based on recurrent neural networks is their large parameter count and their computational complexity, and so, their inference time of one video frame takes up to 66 percent longer than their basic version. Inspired by the success of the spatial and depthwise separable convolutional neural networks, we generalize these techniques for convLSTMs in this work, so that the number of parameters and the required FLOPs are reduced significantly. Experiments on different datasets show that the segmentation approaches using the proposed, modified convLSTM cells achieve similar or slightly worse accuracy, but are up to 15 percent faster on a GPU than the ones using the standard convLSTM cells. Furthermore, a new evaluation metric is introduced, which measures the amount of flickering pixels in the segmented video sequence."}

In this work, we challenge the commonly held belief in deep learning that going deeper is better, and show an alternative design approach that is building wider attention Transformers. We demonstrate that wide single layer Transformer models can compete with or outperform deeper ones in a variety of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks when both are trained from scratch. The impact of changing the model aspect ratio on Transformers is then studied systematically. This ratio balances the number of layers and the number of attention heads per layer while keeping the total number of attention heads and all other hyperparameters constant. On average, across 4 NLP tasks and 10 attention types, single layer wide models perform 0.3% better than their deep counterparts. We show an in-depth evaluation and demonstrate how wide models require a far smaller memory footprint and can run faster on commodity hardware, in addition, these wider models are also more interpretable. For example, a single layer Transformer on the IMDb byte level text classification has 3.1x faster inference latency on a CPU than its equally accurate deeper counterpart, and is half the size. We therefore put forward wider and shallower models as a viable and desirable alternative for small models on NLP tasks, and as an important area of research for domains beyond this."}

In this scenario, the resources available for every inference can vary, so it is useful to be able to dynamically adapt execution to trade accuracy for efficiency. To create dynamic models, we leverage the resilience of vision transformers to pruning and switch between different scaled versions of a model. Surprisingly, we find that most FLOPs are generated by convolutions, not attention. These relative FLOP counts are not a good predictor of GPU performance since GPUs have special optimizations for convolutions. Some models are fairly resilient and their model execution can be adapted without retraining, while all models achieve better accuracy with retraining alternative execution paths. These insights mean that we can leverage CNN accelerators and these alternative execution paths to enable efficient and dynamic vision transformer inference. Our analysis shows that leveraging this type of dynamic execution can lead to saving 28\\% of energy with a 1.4\\% accuracy drop for SegFormer (63 GFLOPs), with no additional training, and 53\\% of energy for ResNet-50 (4 GFLOPs) with a 3.3\\% accuracy drop by switching between pretrained Once-For-All models."}

To address this challenge, we propose an effective adaptation approach for Transformer, namely AdaptFormer, which can adapt the pre-trained ViTs into many different image and video tasks efficiently. It possesses several benefits more appealing than prior arts.

However, their scalability is hampered by the quadratic time and memory complexity of the self-attention mechanism concerning the sequence length. This limitation poses a substantial obstacle when dealing with long documents or high-resolution images. In this work, we study the self-attention mechanism by analyzing the distribution of the attention matrix and its concentration ability. Furthermore, we propose instruments to measure these quantities and introduce a novel self-attention mechanism, Linear Log-Normal Attention, designed to emulate the distribution and concentration behavior of the original self-attention.

For its long-term dependency, the transformer is expected to contribute to unconventional convolution neural net conquer their inherent spatial induction bias. The lately suggested transformer-based segmentation method only uses the transformer as an auxiliary module to help encode the global context into a convolutional representation. How to optimally integrate self-attention with convolution has not been investigated in depth. To solve the problem, this paper proposes MS-Twins (Multi-Scale Twins), which is a powerful segmentation model on account of the bond of self-attention and convolution. MS-Twins can better capture semantic and fine-grained information by combining different scales and cascading features. Compared with the existing network structure, MS-Twins has made progress on the previous method based on the transformer of two in common use data sets, Synapse and ACDC. In particular, the performance of MS-Twins on Synapse is 8% higher than SwinUNet. Even compared with nnUNet, the best entirely convoluted medical image segmentation network, the performance of MS-Twins on Synapse and ACDC still has a bit advantage."}

With Masked attention image Transformer - MaiT, top-1 accuracy increases by up to 1.7% compared to CaiT with fewer parameters and FLOPs, and the throughput improves by up to 1.5X compared to Swin. Encoding locality with attention masks is model agnostic, and thus it applies to monolithic, hierarchical, or other novel transformer architectures."}

Swin Transformer is one of them that outperforms convolution-based architectures in terms of accuracy, while improving efficiency when compared to Vision Transformer (ViT) and its variants, which have quadratic complexity with respect to the input size. Swin Transformer features shifting windows that allows cross-window connection while limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows. However, shifting windows introduces memory copy operations, which account for a significant portion of its runtime. To mitigate this issue, we propose Swin-Free in which we apply size-varying windows across stages, instead of shifting windows, to achieve cross-connection among local windows. With this simple design change, Swin-Free runs faster than the Swin Transformer at inference with better accuracy. Furthermore, we also propose a few of Swin-Free variants that are faster than their Swin Transformer counterparts."}

In this paper, we propose a novel motion decomposition Transformer (ModeT) to explicitly model multiple motion modalities by fully exploiting the intrinsic capability of the Transformer structure for deformation estimation. The proposed ModeT naturally transforms the multi-head neighborhood attention relationship into the multi-coordinate relationship to model multiple motion modes. Then the competitive weighting module (CWM) fuses multiple deformation sub-fields to generate the resulting deformation field. Extensive experiments on two public brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art registration networks and Transformers, demonstrating the potential of our ModeT for the challenging non-rigid deformation estimation problem.

Furthermore, Transformers do not generalize well on small medical imaging datasets and rely on large-scale pre-training due to limited inductive biases. To address these problems, we demonstrate the design of a compact and accurate Transformer network for MISS, CS-Unet, which introduces convolutions in a multi-stage design for hierarchically enhancing spatial and local modeling ability of Transformers.

Vision transformer (ViT)-based segmentation models have shown great performance in accomplishing this task. However, to build a powerful backbone, the self-attention block of ViT requires large-scale pre-training data. The present method of modifying pre-trained models entails updating all or some of the backbone parameters. This paper proposes a novel fine-tuning strategy for adapting a pretrained transformer-based segmentation model on data from a new medical center. This method introduces a small number of learnable parameters, termed prompts, into the input space (less than 1\\% of model parameters) while keeping the rest of the model parameters frozen. Extensive studies employing data from new unseen medical centers show that the prompt-based fine-tuning of medical segmentation models provides excellent performance regarding the new-center data with a negligible drop regarding the old centers. Additionally, our strategy delivers great accuracy with minimum re-training on new-center data, significantly decreasing the computational and time costs of fine-tuning pre-trained models."}

Recent research has demonstrated that such models, when prompted appropriately, are excellent for few-shot inference. However, such techniques are under-explored for dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation. In this work, we examine the effectiveness of prompting a transformer-decoder with learned visual prompts for the generalized few-shot segmentation (GFSS) task. Our goal is to achieve strong performance not only on novel categories with limited examples, but also to retain performance on base categories. We propose an approach to learn visual prompts with limited examples. These learned visual prompts are used to prompt a multiscale transformer decoder to facilitate accurate dense predictions. Additionally, we introduce a unidirectional causal attention mechanism between the novel prompts, learned with limited examples, and the base prompts, learned with abundant data. This mechanism enriches the novel prompts without deteriorating the base class performance. Overall, this form of prompting helps us achieve state-of-the-art performance for GFSS on two different benchmark datasets: COCO-$20^i$ and Pascal-$5^i$, without the need for test-time optimization (or transduction). Furthermore, test-time optimization leveraging unlabelled test data can be used to improve the prompts, which we refer to as transductive prompt tuning."}

However, transformers are computationally expensive, which limits their applications in real-time tasks such as autonomous driving. In addition, an efficient local and global feature selection and fusion are vital for accurate dense prediction, especially driving scene understanding tasks. In this paper, we propose a real-time semantic segmentation architecture named Pyramid Pooling Axial Transformer (P2AT). The proposed P2AT takes a coarse feature from the CNN encoder to produce scale-aware contextual features, which are then combined with the multi-level feature aggregation scheme to produce enhanced contextual features. Specifically, we introduce a pyramid pooling axial transformer to capture intricate spatial and channel dependencies, leading to improved performance on semantic segmentation. Then, we design a Bidirectional Fusion module (BiF) to combine semantic information at different levels. Meanwhile, a Global Context Enhancer is introduced to compensate for the inadequacy of concatenating different semantic levels. Finally, a decoder block is proposed to help maintain a larger receptive field. We evaluate P2AT variants on three challenging scene-understanding datasets.

The knowledge of what is in front of the robot is, for example, relevant for navigation, manipulation, or planning. Semantic segmentation labels each pixel of an image with a class label and thus provides a detailed semantic annotation of the surroundings to the robot. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are popular methods for addressing this type of problem. The available software for training and the integration of CNNs for real robots, however, is quite fragmented and often difficult to use for non-experts, despite the availability of several high-quality open-source frameworks for neural network implementation and training. In this paper, we propose a tool called Bonnet, which addresses this fragmentation problem by building a higher abstraction that is specific for the semantic segmentation task. It provides a modular approach to simplify the training of a semantic segmentation CNN independently of the used dataset and the intended task. Furthermore, we also address the deployment on a real robotic platform. Thus, we do not propose a new CNN approach in this paper. Instead, we provide a stable and easy-to-use tool to make this technology more approachable in the context of autonomous systems. In this sense, we aim at closing a gap between computer vision research and its use in robotics research. We provide an open-source codebase for training and deployment. The training interface is implemented in Python using TensorFlow and the deployment interface provides a C++ library that can be easily integrated in an existing robotics codebase, a ROS node, and two standalone applications for label prediction in images and videos."}

Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics.

To model the representations of the two levels, we first encode the information from the whole into part vectors through an attention mechanism, then decode the global information within the part vectors back into the whole representation. By iteratively parsing the two levels with the proposed encoder-decoder interaction, the model can gradually refine the features on both levels. Experimental results demonstrate that ViP can achieve very competitive performance on three major tasks e.g. classification, detection and instance segmentation. In particular, it can surpass the previous state-of-the-art CNN backbones by a large margin on object detection.
