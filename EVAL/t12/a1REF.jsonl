{"id": "1", "arxiv": "2205.07417v2", "title": "Transformers in 3D Point Clouds: A Survey", "abstract": "Transformers have been at the heart of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV) revolutions. The significant success in NLP and CV inspired exploring the use of Transformers in point cloud processing. However, how do Transformers cope with the irregularity and unordered nature of point clouds? How suitable are Transformers for different 3D representations (e.g., point- or voxel-based)? How competent are Transformers for various 3D processing tasks? As of now, there is still no systematic survey of the research on these issues. For the first time, we provided a comprehensive overview of increasingly popular Transformers for 3D point cloud analysis. We start by introducing the theory of the Transformer architecture and reviewing its applications in 2D/3D fields. Then, we present three different taxonomies (i.e., implementation-, data representation-, and task-based), which can classify current Transformer-based methods from multiple perspectives. Furthermore, we present the results of an investigation of the variants and improvements of the self-attention mechanism in 3D. To demonstrate the superiority of Transformers in point cloud analysis, we present comprehensive comparisons of various Transformer-based methods for classification, segmentation, and object detection. Finally, we suggest three potential research directions, providing benefit references for the development of 3D Transformers."}
{"id": "2", "arxiv": "2206.06323v1", "title": "Visual Transformer for Object Detection", "abstract": "Convolutional Neural networks (CNN) have been the first choice of paradigm in many computer vision applications. The convolution operation however has a significant weakness which is it only operates on a local neighborhood of pixels, thus it misses global information of the surrounding neighbors. Transformers, or Self-attention networks to be more specific, on the other hand, have emerged as a recent advance to capture long range interactions of the input, but they have mostly been applied to sequence modeling tasks such as Neural Machine Translation, Image captioning and other Natural Language Processing tasks. Transformers has been applied to natural language related tasks and achieved promising results. However, its applications in visual related tasks are far from being satisfying. Taking into consideration of both the weaknesses of Convolutional Neural Networks and those of the Transformers, in this paper, we consider the use of self-attention for discriminative visual tasks, object detection, as an alternative to convolutions. In this paper, we propose our model: DetTransNet. Extensive experiments show that our model leads to consistent improvements in object detection on COCO across many different models and scales, including ResNets, while keeping the number of parameters similar. In particular, our method achieves a 1.2% Average Precision improvement on COCO object detection task over other baseline models."}

Compared to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the Vision Transformer (ViT) relies on excellent modeling capabilities to achieve very good performance on several benchmarks such as ImageNet, COCO, and ADE20k. ViT is inspired by the self-attention mechanism in natural language processing, where word embeddings are replaced with patch embeddings. This paper reviews the derivatives of ViT and the cross-applications of ViT with other fields."}
