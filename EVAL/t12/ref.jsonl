{"title": "Deep residual learning for image recognition", "abstract": "Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8× deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset.

We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, exceed the state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build “fully convolutional” networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet [20], the VGG net [31], and GoogLeNet [32]) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning [3] to the segmentation task. We then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional network achieves state-of-the-art segmentation of PASCAL VOC (20% relative improvement to 62.2% mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, and SIFT Flow, while inference takes less than one fifth of a second for a typical image.", "arxivid": "1605.06211v1"}
{"title": "DeepLab: Semantic image segmentation with deep convolutional nets, atrous convolution, and fully connected CRFs", "abstract": "In this work we address the task of semantic image segmentation with Deep Learning and make three main contributions that are experimentally shown to have substantial practical merit. First, we highlight convolution with upsampled filters, or ‘atrous convolution’, as a powerful tool in dense prediction tasks. Atrous convolution allows us to explicitly control the resolution at which feature responses are computed within Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. It also allows us to effectively enlarge the field of view of filters to incorporate larger context without increasing the number of parameters or the amount of computation. Second, we propose atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) to robustly segment objects at multiple scales. ASPP probes an incoming convolutional feature layer with filters at multiple sampling rates and effective fields-of-views, thus capturing objects as well as image context at multiple scales. Third, we improve the localization of object boundaries by combining methods from DCNNs and probabilistic graphical models. The commonly deployed combination of max-pooling and downsampling in DCNNs achieves invariance but has a toll on localization accuracy. We overcome this by combining the responses at the final DCNN layer with a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF), which is shown both qualitatively and quantitatively to improve localization performance. Our proposed “DeepLab” system sets the new state-of-art at the PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic image segmentation task, reaching 79.7 percent mIOU in the test set, and advances the results on three other datasets: PASCAL-Context, PASCAL-Person-Part, and Cityscapes.

The proposed context contrasted local feature greatly improves the parsing performance, especially for inconspicuous objects and background stuff. Furthermore, we propose a scheme of gated sum to selectively aggregate multi-scale features for each spatial position. The gates in this scheme control the information flow of different scale features.

{"title": "Language models are few-shot learners", "abstract": "Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans.

{"title": "Swin transformer: Hierarchical vision transformer using shifted windows", "abstract": "This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with Shifted windows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val).

Our MAE approach is simple: we mask random patches of the input image and reconstruct the missing pixels. It is based on two core designs. First, we develop an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture, with an encoder that operates only on the visible subset of patches (without mask tokens), along with a lightweight decoder that reconstructs the original image from the latent representation and mask tokens. Second, we find that masking a high proportion of the input image, e.g., 75%, yields a nontrivial and meaningful self-supervisory task. Coupling these two designs enables us to train large models efficiently and effectively: we accelerate training (by 3× or more) and improve accuracy. Our scalable approach allows for learning high-capacity models that generalize well: e.g., a vanilla ViT-Huge model achieves the best accuracy (87.8%) among methods that use only ImageNet-1K data.

To revisit VOS and make it more applicable in the real world, we collect a new VOS dataset called coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSE) to study the tracking and segmenting objects in complex scenarios.

{"title": "Improving semantic segmentation via decoupled body and edge supervision", "abstract": "Existing semantic segmentation approaches either aim to improve the object's inner consistency by modeling the global context, or refine objects detail along their boundaries by multi-scale feature fusion. In this paper, a new paradigm for semantic segmentation is proposed. Our insight is that appealing performance of semantic segmentation requires \\textit{explicitly} modeling the object \\textit{body} and \\textit{edge}, which correspond to the high and low frequency of the image. To do so, we first warp the image feature by learning a flow field to make the object part more consistent. The resulting body feature and the residual edge feature are further optimized under decoupled supervision by explicitly sampling different parts (body or edge) pixels. We show that the proposed framework with various baselines or backbone networks leads to better object inner consistency and object boundaries. Extensive experiments on four major road scene semantic segmentation benchmarks including \\textit{Cityscapes}, \\textit{CamVid}, \\textit{KIITI} and \\textit{BDD} show that our proposed approach establishes new state of the art while retaining high efficiency in inference.

Sensing these objects has many applications, including robot navigation and grasping. However, this task is very challenging due to the arbitrary scenes behind glass-like objects. This paper aims to solve the glass-like object segmentation problem via enhanced boundary learning. In particular, we first propose a novel refined differential module that outputs finer boundary cues. We then introduce an edge-aware point-based graph convolution network module to model the global shape along the boundary. We use these two modules to design a decoder that generates accurate and clean segmentation results, especially on the object contours. Both modules are lightweight and effective: they can be embedded into various segmentation models. In extensive experiments on three recent glass-like object segmentation datasets, including Trans10k, MSD, and GDD, our approach establishes new state-of-the-art results.

Specifically, we append two types of attention modules on top of traditional dilated FCN, which model the semantic interdependencies in spatial and channel dimensions respectively. The position attention module selectively aggregates the features at each position by a weighted sum of the features at all positions. Similar features would be related to each other regardless of their distances. Meanwhile, the channel attention module selectively emphasizes interdependent channel maps by integrating associated features among all channel maps. We sum the outputs of the two attention modules to further improve feature representation which contributes to more precise segmentation results. We achieve new state-of-the-art segmentation performance on three challenging scene segmentation datasets, i.e., Cityscapes, PASCAL Context and COCO Stuff dataset.

Instead of using instance-wise ROIs as inputs to a network of fixed weights, we employ dynamic instance-aware networks, conditioned on instances. CondInst enjoys two advantages: 1) Instance segmentation is solved by a fully convolutional network, eliminating the need for ROI cropping and feature alignment. 2) Due to the much improved capacity of dynamically-generated conditional convolutions, the mask head can be very compact (e.g., 3 conv. layers, each having only 8 channels), leading to significantly faster inference. We demonstrate a simpler instance segmentation method that can achieve improved performance in both accuracy and inference speed.

{"title": "Instance segmentation by jointly optimizing spatial embeddings and clustering bandwidth", "abstract": "Current state-of-the-art instance segmentation methods are not suited for real-time applications like autonomous driving, which require fast execution times at high accuracy. Although the currently dominant proposal-based methods have high accuracy, they are slow and generate masks at a fixed and low resolution. Proposal-free methods, by contrast, can generate masks at high resolution and are often faster, but fail to reach the same accuracy as the proposal-based methods. In this work we propose a new clustering loss function for proposal-free instance segmentation. The loss function pulls the spatial embeddings of pixels belonging to the same instance together and jointly learns an instance-specific clustering bandwidth, maximizing the intersection-over-union of the resulting instance mask. When combined with a fast architecture, the network can perform instance segmentation in real-time while maintaining a high accuracy.

The loss function encourages the network to map each pixel to a point in feature space so that pixels belonging to the same instance lie close together while different instances are separated by a wide margin. Our approach of combining an off-the-shelf network with a principled loss function inspired by a metric learning objective is conceptually simple and distinct from recent efforts in instance segmentation. In contrast to previous works, our method does not rely on object proposals or recurrent mechanisms. A key contribution of our work is to demonstrate that such a simple setup without bells and whistles is effective and can perform on par with more complex methods.

However, how to introduce cascade to instance segmentation remains an open question. A simple combination of Cascade R-CNN and Mask R-CNN only brings limited gain. In exploring a more effective approach, we find that the key to a successful instance segmentation cascade is to fully leverage the reciprocal relationship between detection and segmentation. In this work, we propose a new framework, Hybrid Task Cascade (HTC), which differs in two important aspects: (1) instead of performing cascaded refinement on these two tasks separately, it interweaves them for a joint multi-stage processing; (2) it adopts a fully convolutional branch to provide spatial context, which can help distinguishing hard foreground from cluttered background. Overall, this framework can learn more discriminative features progressively while integrating complementary features together in each stage. Without bells and whistles, a single HTC obtains 38.4% and 1.5% improvement over a strong Cascade Mask R-CNN baseline on MSCOCO dataset.

In this work, we propose a simple single-shot instance segmentation framework, termed mask encoding based instance segmentation (MEInst). Instead of predicting the two-dimensional mask directly, MEInst distills it into a compact and fixed-dimensional representation vector, which allows the instance segmentation task to be incorporated into one-stage bounding-box detectors and results in a simple yet efficient instance segmentation framework. The proposed one-stage MEInst achieves 36.4% in mask AP with single-model (ResNeXt-101-FPN backbone) and single-scale testing on the MS-COCO benchmark.

We accomplish this by breaking instance segmentation into two parallel subtasks: (1) generating a set of prototype masks and (2) predicting per-instance mask coefficients. Then we produce instance masks by linearly combining the prototypes with the mask coefficients. We find that because this process doesn't depend on repooling, this approach produces very high-quality masks and exhibits temporal stability for free. Furthermore, we analyze the emergent behavior of our prototypes and show they learn to localize instances on their own in a translation variant manner, despite being fully-convolutional.

In this work, we investigate the paradigm of dense sliding-window instance segmentation, which is surprisingly under-explored. Our core observation is that this task is fundamentally different than other dense prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation or bounding-box object detection, as the output at every spatial location is itself a geometric structure with its own spatial dimensions. To formalize this, we treat dense instance segmentation as a prediction task over 4D tensors and present a general framework called TensorMask that explicitly captures this geometry and enables novel operators on 4D tensors. We demonstrate that the tensor view leads to large gains over baselines that ignore this structure, and leads to results comparable to Mask R-CNN. These promising results suggest that TensorMask can serve as a foundation for novel advances in dense mask prediction and a more complete understanding of the task.

In this work, we address the task of LiDAR-based panoptic segmentation, which aims to parse both objects and scenes in a unified manner. As one of the first endeavors towards this new challenging task, we propose the Dynamic Shifting Network (DS-Net), which serves as an effective panoptic segmentation framework in the point cloud realm. In particular, DS-Net has three appealing properties: 1) strong backbone design. DS-Net adopts the cylinder convolution that is specifically designed for LiDAR point clouds. The extracted features are shared by the semantic branch and the instance branch which operates in a bottom-up clustering style. 2) Dynamic Shifting for complex point distributions. We observe that commonly-used clustering algorithms like BFS or DBSCAN are incapable of handling complex autonomous driving scenes with non-uniform point cloud distributions and varying instance sizes. Thus, we present an efficient learnable clustering module, dynamic shifting, which adapts kernel functions on-the-fly for different instances. 3) Consensus-driven Fusion. Finally, consensus-driven fusion is used to deal with the disagreement between semantic and instance predictions.

Similar to CNNs, ViTs build a simple multi-stage structure (i.e., fine-to-coarse) for multi-scale representation with single-scale patches. In this work, with a different perspective from existing Transformers, we explore multi-scale patch embedding and multi-path structure, constructing the Multi-Path Vision Transformer (MPViT). MPViT embeds features of the same size (i.e., sequence length) with patches of different scales simultaneously by using overlapping convolutional patch embedding. Tokens of different scales are then independently fed into the Transformer encoders via multiple paths and the resulting features are aggregated, enabling both fine and coarse feature representations at the same feature level. Thanks to the diverse, multi-scale feature representations, our MPViTs scaling from tiny (5M) to base (73M) consistently achieve superior performance over state-of-the-art Vision Transformers on ImageNet classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation.", "arxivid": "2112.11010v2"}
{"title": "XCiT: Crosscovariance image transformers", "abstract": "Following their success in natural language processing, transformers have recently shown much promise for computer vision. The self-attention operation underlying transformers yields global interactions between all tokens ,i.e. words or image patches, and enables flexible modelling of image data beyond the local interactions of convolutions. This flexibility, however, comes with a quadratic complexity in time and memory, hindering application to long sequences and high-resolution images. We propose a\"transposed\"version of self-attention that operates across feature channels rather than tokens, where the interactions are based on the cross-covariance matrix between keys and queries. The resulting cross-covariance attention (XCA) has linear complexity in the number of tokens, and allows efficient processing of high-resolution images. Our cross-covariance image transformer (XCiT) is built upon XCA. It combines the accuracy of conventional transformers with the scalability of convolutional architectures. We validate the effectiveness and generality of XCiT by reporting excellent results on multiple vision benchmarks, including image classification and self-supervised feature learning on ImageNet-1k, object detection and instance segmentation on COCO, and semantic segmentation on ADE20k.", "arxivid": ""}

Unlike the recently-proposed Vision Transformer (ViT) that was designed for image classification specifically, we introduce the Pyramid Vision Transformer (PVT), which overcomes the difficulties of porting Transformer to various dense prediction tasks. PVT has several merits compared to current state of the arts. (1) Different from ViT that typically yields low-resolution outputs and incurs high computational and memory costs, PVT not only can be trained on dense partitions of an image to achieve high output resolution, which is important for dense prediction, but also uses a progressive shrinking pyramid to reduce the computations of large feature maps. (2) PVT inherits the advantages of both CNN and Transformer, making it a unified backbone for various vision tasks without convolutions, where it can be used as a direct replacement for CNN backbones. (3) We validate PVT through extensive experiments, showing that it boosts the performance of many downstream tasks, including object detection, instance and semantic segmentation. For example, with a comparable number of parameters, PVT+RetinaNet achieves 40.4 AP on the COCO dataset, surpassing ResNet50+RetinNet (36.3 AP) by 4.1 absolute AP (see Figure 2).

Inspired by this, in this paper, we study how to learn multi-scale feature representations in transformer models for image classification. To this end, we propose a dual-branch transformer to com-bine image patches (i.e., tokens in a transformer) of different sizes to produce stronger image features. Our approach processes small-patch and large-patch tokens with two separate branches of different computational complexity and these tokens are then fused purely by attention multiple times to complement each other. Furthermore, to reduce computation, we develop a simple yet effective token fusion module based on cross attention, which uses a single token for each branch as a query to exchange information with other branches. Our proposed cross-attention only requires linear time for both computational and memory complexity instead of quadratic time otherwise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach performs better than or on par with several concurrent works on vision transformer, in addition to efficient CNN models.

{"title": "Feature pyramid transformer", "abstract": "Feature interactions across space and scales underpin modern visual recognition systems because they introduce beneficial visual contexts. Conventionally, spatial contexts are passively hidden in the CNN's increasing receptive fields or actively encoded by non-local convolution. Yet, the non-local spatial interactions are not across scales, and thus they fail to capture the non-local contexts of objects (or parts) residing in different scales. To this end, we propose a fully active feature interaction across both space and scales, called Feature Pyramid Transformer (FPT). It transforms any feature pyramid into another feature pyramid of the same size but with richer contexts, by using three specially designed transformers in self-level, top-down, and bottom-up interaction fashion. FPT serves as a generic visual backbone with fair computational overhead.

{"title": "ViTAE: Vision transformer advanced by exploring intrinsic inductive bias", "abstract": "Transformers have shown great potential in various computer vision tasks owing to their strong capability in modeling long-range dependency using the self-attention mechanism. Nevertheless, vision transformers treat an image as 1D sequence of visual tokens, lacking an intrinsic inductive bias (IB) in modeling local visual structures and dealing with scale variance. Alternatively, they require large-scale training data and longer training schedules to learn the IB implicitly. In this paper, we propose a novel Vision Transformer Advanced by Exploring intrinsic IB from convolutions, ie, ViTAE. Technically, ViTAE has several spatial pyramid reduction modules to downsample and embed the input image into tokens with rich multi-scale context by using multiple convolutions with different dilation rates. In this way, it acquires an intrinsic scale invariance IB and is able to learn robust feature representation for objects at various scales. Moreover, in each transformer layer, ViTAE has a convolution block in parallel to the multi-head self-attention module, whose features are fused and fed into the feed-forward network. Consequently, it has the intrinsic locality IB and is able to learn local features and global dependencies collaboratively.

It is the hierarchical Transformers (e.g., Swin Transformers) that reintroduced several ConvNet priors, making Transformers practically viable as a generic vision backbone and demonstrating remarkable performance on a wide variety of vision tasks. However, the effectiveness of such hybrid approaches is still largely credited to the intrinsic superiority of Transformers, rather than the inherent inductive biases of convolutions. In this work, we reexamine the design spaces and test the limits of what a pure ConvNet can achieve. We gradually “modernize” a standard ResNet toward the design of a vision Transformer, and discover several key components that contribute to the performance difference along the way. The outcome of this exploration is a family of pure ConvNet models dubbed ConvNeXt.

{"title": "On the connection between local attention and dynamic depth-wise convolution", "abstract": "Vision Transformer (ViT) attains state-of-the-art performance in visual recognition, and the variant, Local Vision Transformer, makes further improvements. The major component in Local Vision Transformer, local attention, performs the attention separately over small local windows. We rephrase local attention as a channel-wise locally-connected layer and analyze it from two network regularization manners, sparse connectivity and weight sharing, as well as weight computation. Sparse connectivity: there is no connection across channels, and each position is connected to the positions within a small local window. Weight sharing: the connection weights for one position are shared across channels or within each group of channels. Dynamic weight: the connection weights are dynamically predicted according to each image instance. We point out that local attention resembles depth-wise convolution and its dynamic version in sparse connectivity. The main difference lies in weight sharing - depth-wise convolution shares connection weights (kernel weights) across spatial positions. We empirically observe that the models based on depth-wise convolution and the dynamic variant with lower computation complexity perform on-par with or sometimes slightly better than Swin Transformer, an instance of Local Vision Transformer, for ImageNet classification, COCO object detection and ADE semantic segmentation.

{"title": "MetaFormer is actually what you need for vision", "abstract": "Transformers have shown great potential in computer vision tasks. A common belief is their attention-based token mixer module contributes most to their competence. However, recent works show the attention-based module in transformers can be replaced by spatial MLPs and the resulted models still perform quite well. Based on this observation, we hypothesize that the general architecture of the transformers, instead of the specific token mixer module, is more essential to the model's performance. To verify this, we deliberately replace the attention module in transformers with an embarrassingly simple spatial pooling operator to conduct only basic token mixing. Surprisingly, we observe that the derived model, termed as PoolFormer, achieves competitive performance on multiple computer vision tasks. For example, on ImageNet-1K, PoolFormer achieves 82.1 % top-1 accuracy, surpassing well-tuned vision transformer/MLP-like baselines DeiT-B/ResMLP-B24 by 0.3%/1.1% accuracy with 35%/52% fewer parameters and 49%/61% fewer MACs. The effectiveness of Pool-Former verifies our hypothesis and urges us to initiate the concept of “MetaFormer”, a general architecture abstracted from transformers without specifying the token mixer. Based on the extensive experiments, we argue that MetaFormer is the key player in achieving superior results for recent transformer and MLP-like models on vision tasks. This work calls for more future research dedicated to improving MetaFormer instead of focusing on the token mixer modules.

{"title": "SOLQ: Segmenting objects by learning queries", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an end-to-end framework for instance segmentation. Based on the recently introduced DETR [1], our method, termed SOLQ, segments objects by learning unified queries. In SOLQ, each query represents one object and has multiple representations: class, location and mask. The object queries learned perform classification, box regression and mask encoding simultaneously in an unified vector form. During training phase, the mask vectors encoded are supervised by the compression coding of raw spatial masks. In inference time, mask vectors produced can be directly transformed to spatial masks by the inverse process of compression coding. Experimental results show that SOLQ can achieve state-of-the-art performance, surpassing most of existing approaches. Moreover, the joint learning of unified query representation can greatly improve the detection performance of DETR.

Inspired by the dilation and erosion operations in morphological image processing techniques, the pixel-level image segmentation problems are treated as squeezing object boundaries. From this perspective, a novel and efficient \\textbf{Boundary Squeeze} module is proposed. This module is used to squeeze the object boundary from both inner and outer directions, which contributes to precise mask representation. A bi-directionally flow-based warping process is proposed to generate such squeezed feature representation, and two specific loss signals are designed to supervise the squeezing process. The Boundary Squeeze module can be easily applied to both instance and semantic segmentation tasks as a plug-and-play module by building on top of some existing methods. Moreover, the proposed module is light-weighted, and thus has potential for practical usage. Experiment results show that our simple yet effective design can produce high-quality results on several different datasets. Besides, several other metrics on the boundary are used to prove the effectiveness of our method over previous work.

The first goal of this paper is to streamline the pipeline of current VOD, effectively removing the need for many hand-crafted components for feature aggregation, e.g., optical flow model, relation networks. Besides, benefited from the object query design in DETR, our method does not need post-processing methods such as Seq-NMS.

Our temporal transformer consists of two components: Temporal Query Encoder (TQE) to fuse object queries, and Temporal Deformable Transformer Decoder (TDTD) to obtain current frame detection results. These designs boost the strong baseline deformable DETR by a significant margin (3 %-4 % mAP) on the ImageNet VID dataset. TransVOD yields comparable performances on the benchmark of ImageNet VID.

{"title": "Conditional detr for fast training convergence", "abstract": "The recently-developed DETR approach applies the transformer encoder and decoder architecture to object detection and achieves promising performance. In this paper, we handle the critical issue, slow training convergence, and present a conditional cross-attention mechanism for fast DETR training. Our approach is motivated by that the cross-attention in DETR relies highly on the content embeddings for localizing the four extremities and predicting the box, which increases the need for high-quality content embeddings and thus the training difficulty.Our approach, named conditional DETR, learns a conditional spatial query from the decoder embedding for decoder multi-head cross-attention. The benefit is that through the conditional spatial query, each cross-attention head is able to attend to a band containing a distinct region, e.g., one object extremity or a region inside the object box. This narrows down the spatial range for localizing the distinct regions for object classification and box regression, thus relaxing the dependence on the content embeddings and easing the training.

By only training a query-based image instance segmentation model, MinVIS outperforms the previous best result on the challenging Occluded VIS dataset by over 10% AP. Since MinVIS treats frames in training videos as independent images, we can drastically sub-sample the annotated frames in training videos without any modifications. With only 1% of labeled frames, MinVIS outperforms or is comparable to fully-supervised state-of-the-art approaches on YouTube-VIS 2019/2021. Our key observation is that queries trained to be discriminative between intra-frame object instances are temporally consistent and can be used to track instances without any manually designed heuristics. MinVIS thus has the following inference pipeline: we first apply the trained query-based image instance segmentation to video frames independently. The segmented instances are then tracked by bipartite matching of the corresponding queries. This inference is done in an online fashion and does not need to process the whole video at once. MinVIS thus has the practical advantages of reducing both the labeling costs and the memory requirements, while not sacrificing the VIS performance.

{"title": "In defense of online models for video instance segmentation", "abstract": "In recent years, video instance segmentation (VIS) has been largely advanced by offline models, while online models gradually attracted less attention possibly due to their inferior performance. However, online methods have their inherent advantage in handling long video sequences and ongoing videos while offline models fail due to the limit of computational resources. Therefore, it would be highly desirable if online models can achieve comparable or even better performance than offline models. By dissecting current online models and offline models, we demonstrate that the main cause of the performance gap is the error-prone association between frames caused by the similar appearance among different instances in the feature space. Observing this, we propose an online framework based on contrastive learning that is able to learn more discriminative instance embeddings for association and fully exploit history information for stability. Despite its simplicity, our method outperforms all online and offline methods on three benchmarks. Specifically, we achieve 49.5 AP on YouTube-VIS 2019, a significant improvement of 13.2 AP and 2.1 AP over the prior online and offline art, respectively. Moreover, we achieve 30.2 AP on OVIS, a more challenging dataset with significant crowding and occlusions, surpassing the prior art by 14.8 AP.

This neglects the mutually-beneficial relations between these two tasks, thus failing to exploit handy instance-level semantic cues to boost depth accuracy while also producing sub-optimal depth maps. To overcome these limitations, we propose a unified framework for the DPS task by applying a dynamic convolution technique to both the PS and depth prediction tasks. Specifically, instead of predicting depth for all pixels at a time, we generate instance-specific kernels to predict depth and segmentation masks for each instance. Moreover, leveraging the instance-wise depth estimation scheme, we add additional instance-level depth cues to assist with supervising the depth learning via a new depth loss.

Instead of modeling the dense per-pixel context among different tasks, we seek a task-specific proxy to perform cross-task reasoning via multiple queries where each query encodes the task-related context. The MQTransformer is composed of three key components: shared encoder, cross-task query attention module and shared decoder. We first model each task with a task-relevant query. Then both the task-specific feature output by the feature extractor and the task-relevant query are fed into the shared encoder, thus encoding the task-relevant query from the task-specific feature. Secondly, we design a cross-task query attention module to reason the dependencies among multiple task-relevant queries; this enables the module to only focus on the query-level interaction. Finally, we use a shared decoder to gradually refine the image features with the reasoned query features from different tasks.

We introduce transformer and multi-head attention to build a network with an encoder-decoder attention mechanism architecture that \"queries\" the given image with the language expression. Furthermore, we propose a Query Generation Module, which produces multiple sets of queries with different attention weights that represent the diversified comprehensions of the language expression from different aspects.

To address these issues, we present the first convolution-free model for referring image segmentation using transformers, dubbed ReSTR. Since it extracts features of both modalities through transformer encoders, it can capture long-range dependencies between entities within each modality. Also, ReSTR fuses features of the two modalities by a self-attention encoder, which enables flexible and adaptive interactions between the two modalities in the fusion process.

The conventional training paradigm is to learn to make predictions on query images conditioned on the features from support images. Previous methods only utilized the semantic-level prototypes of support images as conditional information. These methods cannot utilize all pixel-wise support information for the query predictions, which is however critical for the segmentation task. In this paper, we focus on utilizing pixel-wise relationships between support and query images to facilitate the few-shot segmentation task. We design a novel Cycle-Consistent TRansformer (CyCTR) module to aggregate pixel-wise support features into query ones. CyCTR performs cross-attention between features from different images, i.e. support and query images. We observe that there may exist unexpected irrelevant pixel-level support features. Directly performing cross-attention may aggregate these features from support to query and bias the query features. Thus, we propose using a novel cycle-consistent attention mechanism to filter out possible harmful support features and encourage query features to attend to the most informative pixels from support images.

To solve the problem, we propose an Associating Objects with Transformers (AOT) approach to match and decode multiple objects uniformly. In detail, AOT employs an identification mechanism to associate multiple targets into the same high-dimensional embedding space.

We pretrain an encoder by making predictions in the encoded representation space. The pretraining tasks include two tasks: masked representation prediction—predict the representations for the masked patches, and masked patch reconstruction—reconstruct the masked patches. The network is an encoder–regressor–decoder architecture: the encoder takes the visible patches as input; the regressor predicts the representations of the masked patches, which are expected to be aligned with the representations computed from the encoder, using the representations of visible patches and the positions of visible and masked patches; the decoder reconstructs the masked patches from the predicted encoded representations. The CAE design encourages the separation of learning the encoder (representation) from completing the pertaining tasks: masked representation prediction and masked patch reconstruction tasks, and making predictions in the encoded representation space empirically shows the benefit to representation learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our CAE through superior transfer performance in downstream tasks: semantic segmentation, object detection and instance segmentation, and classification.

For (i), we treat unmasked pixels as sparse voxels of 3D point clouds and use sparse convolution to encode. This is the first use of sparse convolution for 2D masked modeling. For (ii), we develop a hierarchical decoder to reconstruct images from multi-scale encoded features. Our method called Sparse masKed modeling (SparK) is general: it can be used directly on any convolutional model without backbone modifications. We validate it on both classical (ResNet) and modern (ConvNeXt) models: on three downstream tasks, it surpasses both state-of-the-art contrastive learning and transformer-based masked modeling by similarly large margins (around +1.0%). Improvements on object detection and instance segmentation are more substantial (up to +3.5%), verifying the strong transferability of features learned.

{"title": "Scaling up visual and vision-language representation learning with noisy text supervision", "abstract": "Pre-trained representations are becoming crucial for many NLP and perception tasks. While representation learning in NLP has transitioned to training on raw text without human annotations, visual and vision-language representations still rely heavily on curated training datasets that are expensive or require expert knowledge. For vision applications, representations are mostly learned using datasets with explicit class labels such as ImageNet or OpenImages. For vision-language, popular datasets like Conceptual Captions, MSCOCO, or CLIP all involve a non-trivial data collection (and cleaning) process. This costly curation process limits the size of datasets and hence hinders the scaling of trained models. In this paper, we leverage a noisy dataset of over one billion image alt-text pairs, obtained without expensive filtering or post-processing steps in the Conceptual Captions dataset. A simple dual-encoder architecture learns to align visual and language representations of the image and text pairs using a contrastive loss. We show that the scale of our corpus can make up for its noise and leads to state-of-the-art representations even with such a simple learning scheme. Our visual representation achieves strong performance when transferred to classification tasks such as ImageNet and VTAB. The aligned visual and language representations enables zero-shot image classification and also set new state-of-the-art results on Flickr30K and MSCOCO image-text retrieval benchmarks, even when compared with more sophisticated cross-attention models.

In this paper, we show that video masked autoencoders (VideoMAE) are data-efficient learners for self-supervised video pre-training (SSVP). We are inspired by the recent ImageMAE and propose customized video tube masking with an extremely high ratio. This simple design makes video reconstruction a more challenging self-supervision task, thus encouraging extracting more effective video representations during this pre-training process. We obtain three important findings on SSVP: (1) An extremely high proportion of masking ratio (i.e., 90% to 95%) still yields favorable performance of VideoMAE. The temporally redundant video content enables a higher masking ratio than that of images. (2) VideoMAE achieves impressive results on very small datasets (i.e., around 3k-4k videos) without using any extra data. (3) VideoMAE shows that data quality is more important than data quantity for SSVP. Domain shift between pre-training and target datasets is an important issue.

We randomly mask out spacetime patches in videos and learn an autoencoder to reconstruct them in pixels. Interestingly, we show that our MAE method can learn strong representations with almost no inductive bias on spacetime (only except for patch and positional embeddings), and spacetime-agnostic random masking performs the best. We observe that the optimal masking ratio is as high as 90% (vs. 75% on images), supporting the hypothesis that this ratio is related to information redundancy of the data. A high masking ratio leads to a large speedup, e.g.,>4x in wall-clock time or even more. We report competitive results on several challenging video datasets using vanilla Vision Transformers. We observe that MAE can outperform supervised pre-training by large margins. We further report encouraging results of training on real-world, uncurated Instagram data.

To address this issue, we propose a Query Generation Module, which dynamically produces multiple sets of input-specific queries to represent the diverse comprehensions of language expression. To find the best among these diverse comprehensions, so as to generate a better mask, we propose a Query Balance Module to selectively fuse the corresponding responses of the set of queries. Furthermore, to enhance the model's ability in dealing with diverse language expressions, we consider inter-sample learning to explicitly endow the model with knowledge of understanding different language expressions to the same object. We introduce masked contrastive learning to narrow down the features of different expressions for the same target object while distinguishing the features of different objects.

This paper presents SAM-DETR, a Semantic-Aligned-Matching DETR that greatly accelerates DETR's convergence without sacrificing its accuracy. SAM-DETR addresses the convergence issue from two perspectives. First, it projects object queries into the same embedding space as encoded image features, where the matching can be accomplished efficiently with aligned semantics. Second, it explicitly searches salient points with the most discriminative features for semantic-aligned matching, which further speeds up the convergence and boosts detection accuracy as well.

The core idea of SMCA is to conduct location-aware co-attention in DETR by constraining co-attention responses to be high near initially estimated bounding box locations.

The recent query-based object detectors break this convention by decoding image features with a set of learnable queries. However, this paradigm still suffers from slow convergence, limited performance, and design complexity of extra networks between backbone and decoder. In this paper, we find that the key to these issues is the adaptability of decoders for casting queries to varying objects. Accordingly, we propose a fast-converging query-based detector, named AdaMixer, by improving the adaptability of query-based decoding processes in two aspects. First, each query adaptively samples features over space and scales based on estimated offsets, which allows AdaMixer to efficiently attend to the coherent regions of objects. Then, we dynamically decode these sampled features with an adaptive MLP-Mixer under the guidance of each query. Thanks to these two critical designs, AdaMixer enjoys architectural simplicity without requiring dense attentional encoders or explicit pyramid networks.

To address the first limitation, which is due to the quadratic computational complexity of the self-attention module in Transformer encoders, we propose a dynamic encoder to approximate the Transformer encoder’s attention mechanism using a convolution-based dynamic encoder with various attention types. Such an encoder can dynamically adjust attentions based on multiple factors such as scale importance, spatial importance, and representation (i.e., feature dimension) importance. To mitigate the second limitation of learning difficulty, we introduce a dynamic decoder by replacing the cross-attention module with a ROI-based dynamic attention in the Transformer decoder. Such a decoder effectively assists Transformers to focus on region of interests from a coarse-to-fine manner and dramatically lowers the learning difficulty, leading to a much faster convergence with fewer training epochs.

The empirical results suggest that sparse feature sampling from local image areas holds the key. Based on this observation, we alleviate the data-hungry issue of existing detection transformers by simply alternating how key and value sequences are constructed in the cross-attention layer, with minimum modifications to the original models. Besides, we introduce a simple yet effective label augmentation method to provide richer supervision and improve data efficiency. Experiments show that our method can be readily applied to different detection transformers and improve their performance on both small-size and sample-rich datasets.

Previous works utilize separate approaches to handle things, stuff, and part predictions without shared computation and task association. We aim to unify these tasks at the architectural level, designing the first end-to-end unified framework, Panoptic-PartFormer. Moreover, we find the previous metric PartPQ biases to PQ. To handle both issues, we first design a meta-architecture that decouples part features and things/stuff features, respectively. We model things, stuff, and parts as object queries and directly learn to optimize all three forms of prediction as a unified mask prediction and classification problem. We term our model as Panoptic-PartFormer. Second, we propose a new metric Part-Whole Quality (PWQ), better to measure this task from pixel-region and part-whole perspectives. It also decouples the errors for part segmentation and panoptic segmentation. Third, inspired by Mask2Former, based on our meta-architecture, we propose Panoptic-PartFormer++ and design a new part-whole cross-attention scheme to boost part segmentation qualities further. We design a new part-whole interaction method using masked cross attention. Finally, extensive ablation studies and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of both Panoptic-PartFormer and Panoptic-PartFormer++.

Previous works treat a sentence as a whole and directly perform identification at the video-level, mixing up static image-level cues with temporal motion cues. However, image-level features cannot well comprehend motion cues in sentences, and static cues are not crucial for temporal perception. In fact, static cues can sometimes interfere with temporal perception by overshadowing motion cues. In this work, we propose to de-couple video-level referring expression understanding into static and motion perception, with a specific emphasis on enhancing temporal comprehension. Firstly, we introduce an expression-decoupling module to make static cues and motion cues perform their distinct role, alleviating the issue of sentence embeddings overlooking motion cues. Secondly, we propose a hierarchical motion perception module to capture temporal information effectively across varying timescales. Furthermore, we employ contrastive learning to distinguish the motions of visually similar objects.

These two challenges make novel objects hard to be raised in the final instance segmentation results. It is desired to rescue novel objects from background and dominated seen categories. To this end, we propose D2Zero with Semantic-Promoted Debiasing and Background Disambiguation to enhance the performance of Zero-shot instance segmentation. Semantic-promoted debiasing utilizes inter-class semantic relationships to involve unseen categories in visual feature training and learns an input-conditional classifier to conduct dynamical classification based on the input image.

One of the characteristics of FSS is spatial inconsistency between query and support targets, e.g., texture or appearance. This greatly challenges the generalization ability of methods for FSS, which requires to effectively exploit the dependency of the query image and the support examples. Most existing methods abstracted support features into prototype vectors and implemented the interaction with query features using cosine similarity or feature concatenation. However, this simple interaction may not capture spatial details in query features. To address this limitation, some methods utilized pixel-level support information by computing pixel-level correlations between paired query and support features implemented with the attention mechanism of Transformer. Nevertheless, these approaches suffer from heavy computation due to dot-product attention between all pixels of support and query features. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, termed ProtoFormer, built upon the Transformer architecture, to fully capture spatial details in query features. ProtoFormer treats the abstracted prototype of the target class in support features as the Query and the query features as Key and Value embeddings, which are input to the Transformer decoder. This approach enables better capture of spatial details and focuses on the semantic features of the target class in the query image.

Most previous image matting methods rely on trimaps as auxiliary input to define the foreground, background and unknown region.

Thus, it is hard and inflexible to update user’s input or achieve real-time interaction with trimaps. Although some automatic matting approaches discard trimaps, they can only be applied to some certain scenarios, like human matting, which limits their versatility. In this work, we employ clicks as interactive behaviours for image matting, to indicate the user-defined foreground, background and unknown region, and propose a click-based deep interactive image matting (DIIM) approach. Compared with trimaps, clicks provide sparse information and are much easier and more flexible, especially for novice users. Based on clicks, users can perform interactive operations and gradually correct the errors until they are satisfied with the prediction.

To that end, we propose OneFormer, a universal image segmentation framework that unifies segmentation with a multi-task train-once design. We first propose a task-conditioned joint training strategy that enables training on ground truths of each domain (semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation) within a single multi-task training process. Secondly, we introduce a task token to condition our model on the task at hand, making our model task-dynamic to support multi-task training and inference. Thirdly, we propose using a query-text contrastive loss during training to establish better intertask and inter-class distinctions. Notably, our single OneFormer model outperforms specialized Mask2Former models across all three segmentation tasks on ADE20k, Cityscapes, and COCO, despite the latter being trained on each task individually. We believe OneFormer is a significant step towards making image segmentation more universal and accessible.", "arxivid": "2211.06220v2"}

{"title": "Open-vocabulary object detection using captions", "abstract": "Despite the remarkable accuracy of deep neural networks in object detection, they are costly to train and scale due to supervision requirements. Particularly, learning more object categories typically requires proportionally more bounding box annotations. Weakly supervised and zero-shot learning techniques have been explored to scale object detectors to more categories with less supervision, but they have not been as successful and widely adopted as supervised models. In this paper, we put forth a novel formulation of the object detection problem, namely open-vocabulary object detection, which is more general, more practical, and more effective than weakly supervised and zero-shot approaches. We propose a new method to train object detectors using bounding box annotations for a limited set of object categories, as well as image-caption pairs that cover a larger variety of objects at a significantly lower cost. We show that the proposed method can detect and localize objects for which no bounding box annotation is provided during training, at a significantly higher accuracy than zero-shot approaches. Meanwhile, objects with bounding box annotation can be detected almost as accurately as supervised methods, which is significantly better than weakly supervised baselines. Accordingly, we establish a new state of the art for scalable object detection.", "arxivid": "2011.10678v2"}

The fundamental challenge is the availability of training data. It is costly to further scale up the number of classes contained in existing object detection datasets. To overcome this challenge, we propose ViLD, a training method via Vision and Language knowledge Distillation. Our method distills the knowledge from a pretrained open-vocabulary image classification model (teacher) into a two-stage detector (student). Specifically, we use the teacher model to encode category texts and image regions of object proposals. Then we train a student detector, whose region embeddings of detected boxes are aligned with the text and image embeddings inferred by the teacher. We benchmark on LVIS by holding out all rare categories as novel categories that are not seen during training. ViLD obtains 16.1 mask AP$_r$ with a ResNet-50 backbone, even outperforming the supervised counterpart by 3.8. When trained with a stronger teacher model ALIGN, ViLD achieves 26.3 AP$_r$. The model can directly transfer to other datasets without finetuning, achieving 72.2 AP$_{50}$ on PASCAL VOC, 36.6 AP on COCO and 11.8 AP on Objects365.

Image classifiers, on the other hand, reason about much larger vocabularies, as their datasets are larger and easier to collect. We propose Detic, which simply trains the classifiers of a detector on image classification data and thus expands the vocabulary of detectors to tens of thousands of concepts. Unlike prior work, Detic does not need complex assignment schemes to assign image labels to boxes based on model predictions, making it much easier to implement and compatible with a range of detection architectures and backbones. Our results show that Detic yields excellent detectors even for classes without box annotations. It outperforms prior work on both open-vocabulary and long-tail detection benchmarks. Detic provides a gain of 2.4 mAP for all classes and 8.3 mAP for novel classes on the open-vocabulary LVIS benchmark. On the standard LVIS benchmark, Detic obtains 41.7 mAP when evaluated on all classes, or only rare classes, hence closing the gap in performance for object categories with few samples.

Ideally, we would like to extend an open-vocabulary detector such that it can produce bounding box predictions based on user inputs in form of either natural language or exemplar image. This offers great flexibility and user experience for human-computer interaction. To this end, we propose a novel open-vocabulary detector based on DETR -- hence the name OV-DETR -- which, once trained, can detect any object given its class name or an exemplar image. The biggest challenge of turning DETR into an open-vocabulary detector is that it is impossible to calculate the classification cost matrix of novel classes without access to their labeled images. To overcome this challenge, we formulate the learning objective as a binary matching one between input queries (class name or exemplar image) and the corresponding objects, which learns useful correspondence to generalize to unseen queries during testing. For training, we choose to condition the Transformer decoder on the input embeddings obtained from a pre-trained vision-language model like CLIP, in order to enable matching for both text and image queries.

Such zero-shot segmentation ability relies on inter-class relationships in semantic space to transfer the visual knowledge learned from seen categories to unseen ones. Thus, it is desired to well bridge semantic-visual spaces and apply the semantic relationships to visual feature learning. We introduce a generative model to synthesize features for unseen categories, which links semantic and visual spaces as well as address the issue of lack of unseen training data. Furthermore, to mitigate the domain gap between semantic and visual spaces, firstly, we enhance the vanilla generator with learned primitives, each of which contains fine-grained attributes related to categories, and synthesize unseen features by selectively assembling these primitives. Secondly, we propose to disentangle the visual feature into the semantic-related part and the semantic-unrelated part that contains useful visual classification clues but is less relevant to semantic representation. The inter-class relationships of semantic-related visual features are then required to be aligned with those in semantic space, thereby transferring semantic knowledge to visual feature learning.

Towards this goal, numerous learning-free and learning-based approaches have been developed to score objectness. However, they generally do not scale well across new domains and novel objects.

We propose OpenSeg to address the above issue while still making use of scalable image-level supervision of captions. First, it learns to propose segmentation masks for possible organizations. Then it learns visual-semantic alignments by aligning each word in a caption to one or a few predicted masks.

To address this problem, we propose a Masked Image Consistency (MIC) module to enhance UDA by learning spatial context relations of the target domain as additional clues for robust visual recognition. MIC enforces the consistency between predictions of masked target images, where random patches are withheld, and pseudo-labels that are generated based on the complete image by an exponential moving average teacher. To minimize the consistency loss, the network has to learn to infer the predictions of the masked regions from their context. Due to its simple and universal concept, MIC can be integrated into various UDA methods across different visual recognition tasks such as image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. MIC significantly improves the state-of-the-art performance across the different recognition tasks for synthetic-to-real, day-to-nighttime, and clear-toadverse-weather UDA.

{"title": "Exploring sequence feature alignment for domain adaptive detection transformers", "abstract": "Detection transformers have recently shown promising object detection results and attracted increasing attention. However, how to develop effective domain adaptation techniques to improve its cross-domain performance remains unexplored and unclear. In this paper, we delve into this topic and empirically find that direct feature distribution alignment on the CNN backbone only brings limited improvements, as it does not guarantee domain-invariant sequence features in the transformer for prediction. To address this issue, we propose a novel Sequence Feature Alignment (SFA) method that is specially designed for the adaptation of detection transformers. Technically, SFA consists of a domain query-based feature alignment (DQFA) module and a token-wise feature alignment (TDA) module. In DQFA, a novel domain query is used to aggregate and align global context from the token sequence of both domains. DQFA reduces the domain discrepancy in global feature representations and object relations when deploying in the transformer encoder and decoder, respectively. Meanwhile, TDA aligns token features in the sequence from both domains, which reduces the domain gaps in local and instance-level feature representations in the transformer encoder and decoder, respectively. Besides, a novel bipartite matching consistency loss is proposed to enhance the feature discriminability for robust object detection.

{"title": "Sepico: Semantic-guided pixel contrast for domain adaptive semantic segmentation", "abstract": "Domain adaptive semantic segmentation attempts to make satisfactory dense predictions on an unlabeled target domain by utilizing the supervised model trained on a labeled source domain. One popular solution is self-training, which retrains the model with pseudo labels on target instances.

In consequence, they struggle to handle cross-domain semantic variations and fail to build a well-structured embedding space, leading to less discrimination and poor generalization. In this work, we propose Semantic-Guided Pixel Contrast (SePiCo), a novel one-stage adaptation framework that highlights the semantic concepts of individual pixels to promote learning of class-discriminative and class-balanced pixel representations across domains, eventually boosting the performance of self-training methods. Specifically, to explore proper semantic concepts, we first investigate a centroid-aware pixel contrast that employs the category centroids of the entire source domain or a single source image to guide the learning of discriminative features. Considering the possible lack of category diversity in semantic concepts, we then blaze a trail of distributional perspective to involve a sufficient quantity of instances, namely distribution-aware pixel contrast, in which we approximate the true distribution of each semantic category from the statistics of labeled source data. Moreover, such an optimization objective can derive a closed-form upper bound by implicitly involving an infinite number of (dis)similar pairs, making it computationally efficient.

{"title": "LMSeg: Language-guided multi-dataset segmentation", "abstract": "It's a meaningful and attractive topic to build a general and inclusive segmentation model that can recognize more categories in various scenarios. A straightforward way is to combine the existing fragmented segmentation datasets and train a multi-dataset network. However, there are two major issues with multi-dataset segmentation: (1) the inconsistent taxonomy demands manual reconciliation to construct a unified taxonomy; (2) the inflexible one-hot common taxonomy causes time-consuming model retraining and defective supervision of unlabeled categories. In this paper, we investigate the multi-dataset segmentation and propose a scalable Language-guided Multi-dataset Segmentation framework, dubbed LMSeg, which supports both semantic and panoptic segmentation. Specifically, we introduce a pre-trained text encoder to map the category names to a text embedding space as a unified taxonomy, instead of using inflexible one-hot label. The model dynamically aligns the segment queries with the category embeddings. Instead of relabeling each dataset with the unified taxonomy, a category-guided decoding module is designed to dynamically guide predictions to each datasets taxonomy. Furthermore, we adopt a dataset-aware augmentation strategy that assigns each dataset a specific image augmentation pipeline, which can suit the properties of images from different datasets.

In particular, the dataset-aware design is achieved by learning a dataset embedding that is used to adapt object queries as well as convolutional kernels in detection heads. The categories across datasets are semantically aligned into a unified space by replacing one-hot category representations with word embedding and leveraging the semantic coherence of language embedding.

{"title": "Multiclass token transformer for weakly supervised semantic segmentation", "abstract": "This paper proposes a new transformer-based framework to learn class-specific object localization maps as pseudo labels for weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS). Inspired by the fact that the attended regions of the one-class token in the standard vision transformer can be leveraged to form a class-agnostic localization map, we investigate if the transformer model can also effectively capture class-specific attention for more discriminative object localization by learning multiple class tokens within the transformer. To this end, we propose a Multi-class Token Transformer, termed as MCTformer, which uses multiple class tokens to learn interactions between the class tokens and the patch tokens. The proposed MCTformer can successfully produce class-discriminative object localization maps from the class-to-patch attentions corresponding to different class tokens. We also propose to use a patch-level pairwise affinity, which is extracted from the patch-to-patch transformer attention, to further refine the localization maps. Moreover, the proposed framework is shown to fully complement the Class Activation Mapping (CAM) method, leading to remarkably superior WSSS results on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets.

Most of advanced solutions exploit class activation map (CAM). However, CAMs can hardly serve as the object mask due to the gap between full and weak supervisions. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised equivariant attention mechanism (SEAM) to discover additional supervision and narrow the gap. Our method is based on the observation that equivariance is an implicit constraint in fully supervised semantic segmentation, whose pixel-level labels take the same spatial transformation as the input images during data augmentation. However, this constraint is lost on the CAMs trained by image-level supervision. Therefore, we propose consistency regularization on predicted CAMs from various transformed images to provide self-supervision for network learning. Moreover, we propose a pixel correlation module (PCM), which exploits context appearance information and refines the prediction of current pixel by its similar neighbors, leading to further improvement on CAMs consistency.

Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) research has explored many directions to improve the typical pipeline CNN plus class activation maps (CAM) plus refinements, given the image-class label as the only supervision. Though the gap with the fully supervised methods is reduced, further abating the spread seems unlikely within this framework. On the other hand, WSSS methods based on Vision Transformers (ViT) have not yet explored valid alternatives to CAM. ViT features have been shown to retain a scene layout, and object bound-aries in self-supervised learning. To confirm these findings, we prove that the advantages of transformers in self-supervised methods are further strengthened by Global Max Pooling (GMP), which can leverage patch features to negotiate pixel-label probability with class probability.

Our core idea is to redesign the loss of learning masks in instance segmentation, with no modification to the segmentation network itself. The new loss functions can supervise the mask training without relying on mask annotations. This is made possible with two loss terms, namely, 1) a surrogate term that minimizes the discrepancy between the projections of the ground-truth box and the predicted mask; 2) a pairwise loss that can exploit the prior that proximal pixels with similar colors are very likely to have the same category label.Experiments demonstrate that the redesigned mask loss can yield surprisingly high-quality instance masks with only box annotations. For example, without using any mask annotations, with a ResNet-101 backbone and 3× training schedule, we achieve 33.2% mask AP on COCO test-dev split (vs. 39.1% of the fully supervised counterpart).

Additionally, we argue about the importance of having a prior that contains information about objects, or their parts, and discuss several possibilities to obtain such a prior in an unsupervised manner.Experimental evaluation shows that our method comes with key advantages over existing works.

In this work, we strive to achieve a synthesis of these two approaches that combines their strengths. We leverage the retrieval abilities of one such language-image pre-trained model, CLIP, to dynamically curate training sets from unlabelled images for arbitrary collections of concept names, and leverage the robust correspondences offered by modern image representations to co-segment entities among the resulting collections. The synthetic segment collections are then employed to construct a segmentation model (without requiring pixel labels) whose knowledge of concepts is inherited from the scalable pre-training process of CLIP.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mask Transfiner outperforms current instance segmentation methods on three popular benchmarks, significantly improving both two-stage and query-based frameworks by a large margin of +3.0 mask AP on COCO and BDD100K, and +6.6 boundary AP on Cityscapes.

{"title": "Video mask transfiner for high-quality video instance segmentation", "abstract": "While Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) has seen rapid progress, current approaches struggle to predict high-quality masks with accurate boundary details. Moreover, the predicted segmentations often fluctuate over time, suggesting that temporal consistency cues are neglected or not fully utilized. In this paper, we set out to tackle these issues, with the aim of achieving highly detailed and more temporally stable mask predictions for VIS. We first propose the Video Mask Transfiner (VMT) method, capable of leveraging fine-grained high-resolution features thanks to a highly efficient video transformer structure. Our VMT detects and groups sparse error-prone spatio-temporal regions of each tracklet in the video segment, which are then refined using both local and instance-level cues. Second, we identify that the coarse boundary annotations of the popular YouTube-VIS dataset constitute a major limiting factor. Based on our VMT architecture, we therefore design an automated annotation refinement approach by iterative training and self-correction. To benchmark high-quality mask predictions for VIS, we introduce the HQ-YTVIS dataset, consisting of a manually re-annotated test set and our automatically refined training data. We compare VMT with the most recent state-of-the-art methods on the HQ-YTVIS, as well as the Youtube-VIS, OVIS and BDD100K MOTS benchmarks.

Although this design is simple and has been proven effective, it has not yet been explored for interactive image segmentation. To fill this gap, we propose SimpleClick, the first interactive segmentation method that leverages a plain backbone. Based on the plain backbone, we introduce a symmetric patch embedding layer that encodes clicks into the backbone with minor modifications to the backbone itself. With the plain backbone pretrained as a masked autoencoder (MAE), SimpleClick achieves state-of-the-art performance.

{"title": "Ba-sam: Scalable bias-mode attention mask for segment anything model", "abstract": "In this paper, we address the challenge of image resolution variation for the Segment Anything Model (SAM). SAM, known for its zero-shot generalizability, exhibits a performance degradation when faced with datasets with varying image sizes. Previous approaches tend to resize the image to a fixed size or adopt structure modifications, hindering the preservation of SAM's rich prior knowledge. Besides, such task-specific tuning necessitates a complete retraining of the model, which is cost-expensive and unacceptable for deployment in the downstream tasks. In this paper, we reformulate this challenge as a length extrapolation problem, where token sequence length varies while maintaining a consistent patch size for images with different sizes. To this end, we propose a Scalable Bias-Mode Attention Mask (BA-SAM) to enhance SAM's adaptability to varying image resolutions while eliminating the need for structure modifications. Firstly, we introduce a new scaling factor to ensure consistent magnitude in the attention layer's dot product values when the token sequence length changes. Secondly, we present a bias-mode attention mask that allows each token to prioritize neighboring information, mitigating the impact of untrained distant information. Our BA-SAM demonstrates efficacy in two scenarios: zero-shot and finetuning. Extensive evaluation of diverse datasets, including DIS5K, DUTS, ISIC, COD10K, and COCO, reveals its ability to significantly mitigate performance degradation in the zero-shot setting and achieve state-of-the-art performance with minimal fine-tuning.

{"title": "Patchdct: Patch refinement for high quality instance segmentation", "abstract": "High-quality instance segmentation has shown emerging importance in computer vision. Without any refinement, DCT-Mask directly generates high-resolution masks by compressed vectors. To further refine masks obtained by compressed vectors, we propose for the first time a compressed vector based multi-stage refinement framework. However, the vanilla combination does not bring significant gains, because changes in some elements of the DCT vector will affect the prediction of the entire mask. Thus, we propose a simple and novel method named PatchDCT, which separates the mask decoded from a DCT vector into several patches and refines each patch by the designed classifier and regressor. Specifically, the classifier is used to distinguish mixed patches from all patches, and to correct previously mispredicted foreground and background patches. In contrast, the regressor is used for DCT vector prediction of mixed patches, further refining the segmentation quality at boundary locations. Experiments on COCO show that our method achieves 2.0%, 3.2%, 4.5% AP and 3.4%, 5.3%, 7.0% Boundary AP improvements over Mask-RCNN on COCO, LVIS, and Cityscapes, respectively.

We resolve the issue by leveraging memory networks and learn to read relevant information from all available sources. In our framework, the past frames with object masks form an external memory, and the current frame as the query is segmented using the mask information in the memory. Specifically, the query and the memory are densely matched in the feature space, covering all the space-time pixel locations in a feed-forward fashion.

In this per-clip inference scheme, we update the memory with an interval and simul-taneously process a set of consecutive frames (i.e. clip) between the memory updates. The scheme provides two potential benefits: accuracy gain by clip-level optimization and efficiency gain by parallel computation of multiple frames. To this end, we propose a new method tailored for the perclip inference. Specifically, we first introduce a clip-wise operation to refine the features based on intra-clip correlation.

In this paper, we argue that instance understanding matters in VOS, and integrating it with memory-based matching can enjoy the synergy, which is intuitively sensible from the definition of VOS task, i.e., identifying and segmenting object instances within the video. Towards this goal, we present a two-branch network for VOS, where the query-based instance segmentation (IS) branch delves into the instance details of the current frame and the VOS branch performs spatial-temporal matching with the memory bank. We employ the well-learned object queries from IS branch to inject instance-specific information into the query key, with which the instance-augmented matching is further performed.

This gives us reasonably good results compared with the counterparts trained on segmentation task only.

To address these issues, we propose a decoupled decoding to reduce the interference between foreground/background and a conditioned mask decoding to assist in generating masks for given boxes.

Intuitively, a possible strategy to enhance CIs is replicating the inference phase during training. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective training strategy, called Consistent Training for Online VIS (CTVIS), which devotes to aligning the training and inference pipelines in terms of building CIs. Specifically, CTVIS constructs CIs by referring inference the momentum-averaged embedding and the memory bank storage mechanisms, and adding noise to the relevant embeddings. Such an extension allows a reliable comparison between embeddings of current instances and the stable representations of historical instances, thereby conferring an advantage in modeling VIS challenges such as occlusion, re-identification, and deformation.

Additionally, we introduce a memory that effectively acquires information from previous states. Thanks to the new perspective, which focuses on building relationships between separate frames or clips, GenVIS can be flexibly executed in both online and semi-online manner. We evaluate our approach on popular VIS benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results on YouTube-VIS 2019/2021/2022 and Occluded VIS (OVIS).

Classic solutions usually decompose the VPS task into several subtasks and utilize multiple surrogates (e.g. boxes and masks, centers and offsets) to represent objects. However, this divide-and-conquer strategy requires complex post-processing in both spatial and temporal domains and is vulnerable to failures from surrogate tasks. In this paper, inspired by object-centric learning which learns compact and robust object representations, we present Slot- VPS, the first end-to-end framework for this task. We encode all panoptic entities in a video, including both foreground instances and background semantics, with a unified representation called panoptic slots. The coherent spatio-temporal object's information is retrieved and encoded into the panoptic slots by the proposed Video Panoptic Retriever, enabling to localize, segment, differentiate, and associate objects in a unified manner. Finally, the output panoptic slots can be directly converted into the class, mask, and object ID of panoptic objects in the video.

While simple, the pixel-level ZS3 formulation shows the limited capability to integrate vision-language models that are often pre-trained with image-text pairs and currently demonstrate great potential for vision tasks. Inspired by the observation that humans often perform segment-level semantic labeling, we propose to decouple the ZS3 into two sub-tasks: 1) a classagnostic grouping task to group the pixels into segments. 2) a zero-shot classification task on segments. The former task does not involve category information and can be directly transferred to group pixels for unseen classes.

We identify the performance bottleneck of this paradigm to be the pre-trained CLIP model, since it does not perform well on masked images.

Along with finetuning the entire model, we utilize the “blank” areas in masked images using a method we dub mask prompt tuning. Experiments demonstrate mask prompt tuning brings significant improvement without modifying any weights of CLIP, and it can further improve a fully finetuned model.

However, existing OVS techniques confront a fundamental challenge: the trained classifier tends to over-fit on the base classes observed during training, resulting in suboptimal generalization performance to unseen classes. To mitigate this issue, recent studies have proposed the use of an additional frozen pre-trained CLIP for classification. Nonetheless, this approach incurs heavy computational overheads as the CLIP vision encoder must be repeatedly forward-passed for each mask, rendering it impractical for real-world applications. To address this challenge, our objective is to develop a fast OVS model that can perform comparably or better without the extra computational burden of the CLIP image encoder during inference. To this end, we propose a core idea of preserving the generalizable representation when fine-tuning on known classes. Specifically, we introduce a text diversification strategy that generates a set of synonyms for each training category, which prevents the learned representation from collapsing onto specific known category names. Additionally, we employ a text-guided knowledge distillation method to preserve the generalizable knowledge of CLIP.

Specifically, our dataset contains over 108K images where each image has an average of 35\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$35$$\\end{document} objects, 26\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$26$$\\end{document} attributes, and 21\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$21$$\\end{document} pairwise relationships between objects.

{"title": "Open-vocabulary instance segmentation via robust cross-modal pseudo-labeling", "abstract": "Open-vocabulary instance segmentation aims at segmenting novel classes without mask annotations. It is an important step toward reducing laborious human supervision. Most existing works first pretrain a model on captioned images covering many novel classes and then finetune it on limited base classes with mask annotations. However, the high-level textual information learned from caption pretraining alone cannot effectively encode the details required for pixelwise segmentation. To address this, we propose a cross-modal pseudo-labeling framework, which generates training pseudo masks by aligning word semantics in captions with visual features of object masks in images. Thus, our framework is capable of labeling novel classes in captions via their word semantics to self-train a student model. To account for noises in pseudo masks, we design a robust student model that selectively distills mask knowledge by estimating the mask noise levels, hence mitigating the adverse impact of noisy pseudo masks. By extensive experiments, we show the effectiveness of our framework, where we significantly improve mAP score by 4.5% on MS-COCO and 5.1 % on the large-scale Open Images & Conceptual Captions datasets compared to the state-of-the-art.11Code is available at https://github.com/hbdat/cvpr22_cross_modal_pseudo_labeling.", "arxivid": "2111.12698v2"}
{"title": "Mask-free ovis: Open-vocabulary instance segmentation without manual mask annotations", "abstract": "Existing instance segmentation models learn task-specific information using manual mask annotations from base (training) categories. These mask annotations require tremendous human effort, limiting the scalability to annotate novel (new) categories. To alleviate this problem, Open-Vocabulary (OV) methods leverage large-scale image-caption pairs and vision-language models to learn novel categories. In summary, an OV method learns task-specific information using strong supervision from base annotations and novel category information using weak supervision from image-captions pairs. This difference between strong and weak supervision leads to overfitting on base categories, resulting in poor generalization towards novel categories. In this work, we overcome this issue by learning both base and novel categories from pseudo-mask annotations generated by the vision-language model in a weakly supervised manner using our proposed Mask-free OVIS pipeline. Our method automatically generates pseudo-mask annotations by leveraging the localization ability of a pre-trained vision-language model for objects present in image-caption pairs. The generated pseudo-mask annotations are then used to supervise an instance segmentation model, freeing the entire pipeline from any labour-expensive instance-level annotations and overfitting. Our extensive experiments show that our method trained with just pseudo-masks significantly improves the mAP scores on the MS-COCO dataset and OpenImages dataset compared to the recent state-of-the-art methods trained with manual masks.

{"title": "Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation with visual words learning and hybrid pooling", "abstract": "Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods with image-level labels generally train a classification network to generate the Class Activation Maps (CAMs) as the initial coarse segmentation labels. However, current WSSS methods still perform far from satisfactorily because their adopted CAMs (1) typically focus on partial discriminative object regions and (2) usually contain useless background regions. These two problems are attributed to the sole image-level supervision and aggregation of global information when training the classification networks. In this work, we propose the visual words learning module and hybrid pooling approach, and incorporate them in classification network to mitigate the above problems. In visual words learning module, we counter the first problem by enforcing the classification network to learn fine-grained visual word labels so that more object extents could be discovered. Specifically, the visual words are learned with a codebook, which could be updated via two proposed strategies, i.e. learning-based strategy and memory-bank strategy. The second drawback of CAMs is alleviated with the proposed hybrid pooling, which incorporates the global average and local discriminative information to simultaneously ensure object completeness and reduce background regions. We evaluated our methods on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets. Without any extra saliency prior, our method achieved 70.6% and 70.7% mIoU on the val and test set of PASCAL VOC dataset, respectively, and 36.2% mIoU on the val set of MS COCO dataset, which significantly surpassed the performance of state-of-the-art WSSS methods.", "arxivid": "2202.04812v1"}
{"title": "Mctformer+: Multi-class token transformer for weakly supervised semantic segmentation", "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel transformer-based framework to generate accurate class-specific object localization maps for weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS). Leveraging the insight that the attended regions of the one-class token in the standard vision transformer can generate class-agnostic localization maps, we investigate the transformer's capacity to capture class-specific attention for class-discriminative object localization by learning multiple class tokens. We present the Multi-Class Token transformer, which incorporates multiple class tokens to enable class-aware interactions with patch tokens. This is facilitated by a class-aware training strategy that establishes a one-to-one correspondence between output class tokens and ground-truth class labels. We also introduce a Contrastive-Class-Token (CCT) module to enhance the learning of discriminative class tokens, enabling the model to better capture the unique characteristics of each class. Consequently, the proposed framework effectively generates class-discriminative object localization maps from the class-to-patch attentions associated with different class tokens. To refine these localization maps, we propose the utilization of patch-level pairwise affinity derived from the patch-to-patch transformer attention. Furthermore, the proposed framework seamlessly complements the Class Activation Mapping (CAM) method, yielding significant improvements in WSSS performance on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014. These results underline the importance of the class token for WSSS.", "arxivid": "2308.03005v1"}
{"title": "Token contrast for weaklysupervised semantic segmentation", "abstract": "Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) using image-level labels typically utilizes Class Activation Map (CAM) to generate the pseudo labels. Limited by the local structure perception of CNN, CAM usually cannot identify the integral object regions. Though the recent Vision Transformer (ViT) can remedy this flaw, we observe it also brings the over-smoothing issue, i.e., the final patch tokens incline to be uniform. In this work, we propose Token Contrast (ToCo) to address this issue and further explore the virtue of ViT for WSSS. Firstly, motivated by the observation that intermediate layers in ViT can still retain semantic diversity, we designed a Patch Token Contrast module (PTC). PTC supervises the final patch tokens with the pseudo token relations derived from intermediate layers, allowing them to align the semantic regions and thus yield more accurate CAM. Secondly, to further differentiate the low-confidence regions in CAM, we devised a Class Token Contrast module (CTC) inspired by the fact that class tokens in ViT can capture high-level semantics. CTC facilitates the representation consistency between uncertain local regions and global objects by contrasting their class tokens. Experiments on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets show the proposed ToCo can remarkably surpass other single-stage competitors and achieve comparable performance with state-of-the-art multi-stage methods.

With the advent of self-supervised pre-training, various frameworks utilize the pre-trained features to train prediction heads for unsupervised dense prediction. However, a significant challenge in this unsupervised setup is determining the appropriate level of clustering required for segmenting concepts. To address it, we propose a novel framework, CAusal Unsupervised Semantic sEgmentation (CAUSE), which leverages insights from causal inference. Specifically, we bridge intervention-oriented approach (i.e., frontdoor adjustment) to define suitable two-step tasks for unsupervised prediction. The first step involves constructing a concept clusterbook as a mediator, which represents possible concept prototypes at different levels of granularity in a discretized form. Then, the mediator establishes an explicit link to the subsequent concept-wise self-supervised learning for pixel-level grouping. Through extensive experiments and analyses on various datasets, we corroborate the effectiveness of CAUSE and achieve state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised semantic segmentation.", "arxivid": "2310.07379v1"}

Leveraging data augmentations is a promising direction towards addressing this challenge.

Prior studies on Copy-Paste relied on modeling the surrounding visual context for pasting the objects. However, we find that the simple mechanism of pasting objects randomly is good enough and can provide solid gains on top of strong baselines. Furthermore, we show Copy-Paste is additive with semi-supervised methods that leverage extra data through pseudo labeling (e.g. self-training). On COCO instance segmentation, we achieve 49.1 mask AP and 57.3 box AP, an improvement of +0.6 mask AP and +1.5 box AP over the previous state-of-the-art.

{"title": "Afformer: Head-free lightweight semantic segmentation with linear transformer", "abstract": "Existing semantic segmentation works have been mainly focused on designing effective decoders; however, the computational load introduced by the overall structure has long been ignored, which hinders their applications on resource-constrained hardwares. In this paper, we propose a head-free lightweight architecture specifically for semantic segmentation, named Adaptive Frequency Transformer (AFFormer). AFFormer adopts a parallel architecture to leverage prototype representations as specific learnable local descriptions which replaces the decoder and preserves the rich image semantics on high-resolution features. Although removing the decoder compresses most of the computation, the accuracy of the parallel structure is still limited by low computational resources. Therefore, we employ heterogeneous operators (CNN and vision Transformer) for pixel embedding and prototype representations to further save computational costs. Moreover, it is very difficult to linearize the complexity of the vision Transformer from the perspective of spatial domain. Due to the fact that semantic segmentation is very sensitive to frequency information, we construct a lightweight prototype learning block with adaptive frequency filter of complexity O(n) to replace standard self attention with O(n^2). Extensive experiments on widely adopted datasets demonstrate that AFFormer achieves superior accuracy while retaining only 3M parameters. On the ADE20K dataset, AFFormer achieves 41.8 mIoU and 4.6 GFLOPs, which is 4.4 mIoU higher than Segformer, with 45% less GFLOPs.

In this work, we address the task of LiDAR-based panoptic segmentation, which aims to parse both objects and scenes in a unified manner. As one of the first endeavors towards this new challenging task, we propose the Dynamic Shifting Network (DS-Net), which serves as an effective panoptic segmentation framework in the point cloud realm. In particular, DS-Net has three appealing properties: 1) Strong backbone design. DS-Net adopts the cylinder convolution that is specifically designed for LiDAR point clouds. 2) Dynamic Shifting for complex point distributions. We observe that commonly-used clustering algorithms are incapable of handling complex autonomous driving scenes with non-uniform point cloud distributions and varying instance sizes. Thus, we present an efficient learnable clustering module, dynamic shifting, which adapts kernel functions on the fly for different instances. 3) Extension to 4D prediction. Furthermore, we extend DS-Net to 4D panoptic LiDAR segmentation by the temporally unified instance clustering on aligned LiDAR frames.
