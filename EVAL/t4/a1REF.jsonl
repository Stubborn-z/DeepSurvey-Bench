The crucial computational mechanism underlying their performance relies on transforming a complete input sequence - for example, all the words in a sentence - into a long \"encoding vector\" that allows transformers to learn long-range temporal dependencies in naturalistic sequences. Specifically, \"self-attention\" applied to this encoding vector enhances temporal context in transformers by computing associations between pairs of words in the input sequence. We suggest that waves of neural activity traveling across single cortical areas or multiple regions at the whole-brain scale could implement a similar encoding principle. By encapsulating recent input history into a single spatial pattern at each moment in time, cortical waves may enable temporal context to be extracted from sequences of sensory inputs, the same computational principle used in transformers."}

Unlike conventional neural networks or updated versions of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), transformer models excel in handling long dependencies between input sequence elements and enable parallel processing. As a result, transformer-based models have attracted substantial interest among researchers in the field of artificial intelligence. This can be attributed to their immense potential and remarkable achievements, not only in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks but also in a wide range of domains, including computer vision, audio and speech processing, healthcare, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Although several survey papers have been published highlighting the transformer's contributions in specific fields, architectural differences, or performance evaluations, there is still a significant absence of a comprehensive survey paper encompassing its major applications across various domains. Therefore, we undertook the task of filling this gap by conducting an extensive survey of proposed transformer models from 2017 to 2022. Our survey encompasses the identification of the top five application domains for transformer-based models, namely: NLP, Computer Vision, Multi-Modality, Audio and Speech Processing, and Signal Processing. We analyze the impact of highly influential transformer-based models in these domains and subsequently classify them based on their respective tasks using a proposed taxonomy. Our aim is to shed light on the existing potential and future possibilities of transformers for enthusiastic researchers, thus contributing to the broader understanding of this groundbreaking technology."}

However, FFN and traditional memory utilize different activation functions (i.e., ReLU and Softmax respectively), which makes them not equivalent. In this paper, we first rebuild the connections between FFN and key-value memory by conducting extensive studies on ReLU and Softmax, and find they are equivalent when adding an additional layer normalization module on Softmax. In addition, ReLU outperforms Softmax on both FFN and key-value memory when the number of value slots is large. We analyze the reasons and then explore this good property of ReLU on the self-attention network where the original Softmax activation performs poorly on long input sequences. We then propose a full ReLU architecture named ReLUFormer which performs better than the baseline Transformer on long sequence tasks such as document translation. This paper sheds light on the following points: 1) Softmax and ReLU use different normalization methods over elements which lead to different variances of results, and ReLU is good at dealing with a large number of key-value slots; 2) FFN and key-value memory are equivalent, and thus the Transformer can be viewed as a memory network where FFNs and self-attention networks are both key-value memories."}

{"id": "6", "arxiv": "2006.11527v2", "title": "Memory Transformer", "abstract": "Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art results in many natural language processing tasks. The self-attention architecture allows transformer to combine information from all elements of a sequence into context-aware representations. However, information about the context is stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. This might limit the processing of properties related to the sequence as a whole more difficult. Adding trainable memory to selectively store local as well as global representations of a sequence is a promising direction to improve the Transformer model. Memory-augmented neural networks (MANNs) extend traditional neural architectures with general-purpose memory for representations. MANNs have demonstrated the capability to learn simple algorithms like Copy or Reverse and can be successfully trained via backpropagation on diverse tasks from question answering to language modeling outperforming RNNs and LSTMs of comparable complexity. In this work, we propose and study few extensions of the Transformer baseline (1) by adding memory tokens to store non-local representations, (2) creating memory bottleneck for the global information, (3) controlling memory update with dedicated layer. We evaluate these memory augmented Transformers and demonstrate that presence of memory positively correlates with the model performance for machine translation and language modelling tasks. Augmentation of pre-trained masked language model with memory tokens shows mixed results for tasks from GLUE benchmark. Visualization of attention patterns over the memory suggest that it improves the model's ability to process a global context."}

The ability to increase the number of parameters while keeping the same computational budget lets the overall system strike a better trade-off between prediction accuracy and computation efficiency both at training and test time. This memory layer allows us to tackle very large scale language modeling tasks. In our experiments we consider a dataset with up to 30 billion words, and we plug our memory layer in a state-of-the-art transformer-based architecture. In particular, we found that a memory augmented model with only 12 layers outperforms a baseline transformer model with 24 layers, while being twice faster at inference time.

{"id": "8", "arxiv": "2311.13110v2", "title": "White-Box Transformers via Sparse Rate Reduction: Compression Is All There Is?", "abstract": "In this paper, we contend that a natural objective of representation learning is to compress and transform the distribution of the data, say sets of tokens, towards a low-dimensional Gaussian mixture supported on incoherent subspaces. The goodness of such a representation can be evaluated by a principled measure, called sparse rate reduction, that simultaneously maximizes the intrinsic information gain and extrinsic sparsity of the learned representation. From this perspective, popular deep network architectures, including transformers, can be viewed as realizing iterative schemes to optimize this measure. Particularly, we derive a transformer block from alternating optimization on parts of this objective: the multi-head self-attention operator compresses the representation by implementing an approximate gradient descent step on the coding rate of the features, and the subsequent multi-layer perceptron sparsifies the features. This leads to a family of white-box transformer-like deep network architectures, named CRATE, which are mathematically fully interpretable. We show, by way of a novel connection between denoising and compression, that the inverse to the aforementioned compressive encoding can be realized by the same class of CRATE architectures. Thus, the so-derived white-box architectures are universal to both encoders and decoders. Experiments show that these networks, despite their simplicity, indeed learn to compress and sparsify representations of large-scale real-world image and text datasets, and achieve performance very close to highly engineered transformer-based models: ViT, MAE, DINO, BERT, and GPT2. We believe the proposed computational framework demonstrates great potential in bridging the gap between theory and practice of deep learning, from a unified perspective of data compression.

In cognitive neuroscience, success on such tasks is thought to rely on sophisticated frontostriatal mechanisms for selective \\textit{gating}, which enable role-addressable updating -- and later readout -- of information to and from distinct \"addresses\" of memory, in the form of clusters of neurons. However, Transformer models have no such mechanisms intentionally built-in. It is thus an open question how Transformers solve such tasks, and whether the mechanisms that emerge to help them to do so bear any resemblance to the gating mechanisms in the human brain. In this work, we analyze the mechanisms that emerge within a vanilla attention-only Transformer trained on a simple sequence modeling task inspired by a task explicitly designed to study working memory gating in computational cognitive neuroscience. We find that, as a result of training, the self-attention mechanism within the Transformer specializes in a way that mirrors the input and output gating mechanisms which were explicitly incorporated into earlier, more biologically-inspired architectures. These results suggest opportunities for future research on computational similarities between modern AI architectures and models of the human brain."}

Probing these mechanisms for their information content, we can capture the difference in computational power that various systems are capable of. Most human cognitive abilities, from perception to action to memory, are shared with other species; we seek to characterize those (few) capabilities that are ubiquitously present among humans and absent from other species. Three realms of formidable constraints -- a) measurable human cognitive abilities, b) measurable allometric anatomic brain characteristics, and c) measurable features of specific automata and formal grammars -- illustrate remarkably sharp restrictions on human abilities, unexpectedly confining human cognition to a specific class of automata (\"nested stack\"), which are markedly below Turing machines."}

Researchers across various disciplines have shown consistent interest in the process of concept acquisition in individuals. To elucidate the mechanisms involved in human concept learning, this study examines the findings from computational neuroscience and cognitive psychology. These findings indicate that the brain's representation of concepts relies on two essential components: multisensory representation and text-derived representation. These two types of representations are coordinated by a semantic control system, ultimately leading to the acquisition of concepts. Drawing inspiration from this mechanism, the study develops a human-like computational model for concept learning based on spiking neural networks. By effectively addressing the challenges posed by diverse sources and imbalanced dimensionality of the two forms of concept representations, the study successfully attains human-like concept representations. Tests involving similar concepts demonstrate that our model, which mimics the way humans learn concepts, yields representations that closely align with human cognition."}

The theory of complementary learning systems (McClelland et al., 1995) suggests that the compressed representation produced by a serial event (episodic memory) is later restructured to build a more generalized form of reusable knowledge (semantic memory). In this work we develop a new principled Bayesian memory allocation scheme that bridges the gap between episodic and semantic memory via a hierarchical latent variable model. We take inspiration from traditional heap allocation and extend the idea of locally contiguous memory to the Kanerva Machine, enabling a novel differentiable block allocated latent memory. In contrast to the Kanerva Machine, we simplify the process of memory writing by treating it as a fully feed forward deterministic process, relying on the stochasticity of the read key distribution to disperse information within the memory. We demonstrate that this allocation scheme improves performance in memory conditional image generation, resulting in new state-of-the-art conditional likelihood values on binarized MNIST (<=41.58 nats/image) , binarized Omniglot (<=66.24 nats/image), as well as presenting competitive performance on CIFAR10, DMLab Mazes, Celeb-A and ImageNet32x32."}

Generally speaking, it is possible to see the analogy of knowledge elaboration between humankind's way and the artificial system's way. Digital data are the \"feelings\" of an artificial system, and it needs to invent a method of extraction of knowledge from the Universe of data. The cognitive computing paradigm implies that a system should be able to extract the knowledge from raw data without any human-made algorithm. The first step of the paradigm is analysis of raw data streams through the discovery of repeatable patterns of data. The knowledge of relationships among the patterns provides a way to see the structures and to generalize the concepts with the goal to synthesize new statements. The cognitive computing paradigm is capable of mimicking the human's ability to generalize the notions. It is possible to say that the generalization step provides the basis for discovering the abstract notions, revealing the abstract relations of patterns and general rules of structure synthesis. If anyone continues the process of structure generalization, then it is possible to build the multi-level hierarchy of abstract notions. Moreover, discovering the generalized classes of notions is the first step towards a paradigm of artificial analytical thinking. The most critical possible responsibility of cognitive computing could be the classification of data and recognition of input data stream's states.

There exists pressing evidence that the cognitive mechanisms that enable problem-solving skills in these species build on hierarchical mental representations. Among the most promising computational approaches to provide comparable learning-based problem-solving abilities for artificial agents and robots is hierarchical reinforcement learning. However, so far the existing computational approaches have not been able to equip artificial agents with problem-solving abilities that are comparable to intelligent animals, including human and non-human primates, crows, or octopuses. Here, we first survey the literature in Cognitive Psychology, and related disciplines, and find that many important mental mechanisms involve compositional abstraction, curiosity, and forward models. We then relate these insights with contemporary hierarchical reinforcement learning methods, and identify the key machine intelligence approaches that realise these mechanisms. As our main result, we show that all important cognitive mechanisms have been implemented independently in isolated computational architectures, and there is simply a lack of approaches that integrate them appropriately.

Leveraging insights from neuroscience and existing research in adversarial and continual learning, we introduce a novel framework comprising two core concepts: feature distillation and re-consolidation. Our framework, named Robust Rehearsal, addresses the challenge of catastrophic forgetting inherent in continual learning (CL) systems by distilling and rehearsing robust features. Inspired by the mammalian brain's memory consolidation process, Robust Rehearsal aims to emulate the rehearsal of distilled experiences during learning tasks. Additionally, it mimics memory re-consolidation, where new experiences influence the integration of past experiences to mitigate forgetting. Extensive experiments conducted on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and real-world helicopter attitude datasets showcase the superior performance of CL models trained with Robust Rehearsal compared to baseline methods. Furthermore, examining different optimization training objectives-joint, continual, and adversarial learning-we highlight the crucial role of feature learning in model performance. This underscores the significance of rehearsing CL-robust samples in mitigating catastrophic forgetting. In conclusion, aligning CL approaches with neuroscience insights offers promising solutions to the challenge of catastrophic forgetting, paving the way for more robust and human-like AI systems."}

However, the growth of the KV cache in response to increasing input length poses challenges to memory and time efficiency. To address this problem, this paper introduces SnapKV, an innovative and fine-tuning-free approach that efficiently minimizes KV cache size while still delivering comparable performance in real-world applications. We discover that each attention head in the model consistently focuses on specific prompt attention features during generation. Meanwhile, this robust pattern can be obtained from an 'observation' window located at the end of the prompts. Drawing on this insight, SnapKV automatically compresses KV caches by selecting clustered important KV positions for each attention head. Our approach significantly reduces the growing computational overhead and memory footprint when processing long input sequences. Specifically, SnapKV achieves a consistent decoding speed with a 3.6x increase in generation speed and an 8.2x enhancement in memory efficiency compared to the baseline when processing inputs of 16K tokens. At the same time, it maintains comparable performance to the baseline models across 16 long sequence datasets.

These challenges cannot be addressed by LLMs alone, but should rely on assistance from the external world, such as knowledge base, memory store, demonstration examples, and tools. Retrieval augmentation stands as a vital mechanism for bridging the gap between LLMs and the external assistance. However, conventional methods encounter two pressing issues. On the one hand, the general-purpose retrievers are not properly optimized for the retrieval augmentation of LLMs. On the other hand, the task-specific retrievers lack the required versatility, hindering their performance across the diverse retrieval augmentation scenarios. In this work, we present a novel approach, the LLM-Embedder, which comprehensively supports the diverse retrieval augmentation needs of LLMs with one unified embedding model. Training such a unified model is non-trivial, as various retrieval tasks aim to capture distinct semantic relationships, often subject to mutual interference. To address this challenge, we systematically optimize our training methodology. This includes reward formulation based on LLMs' feedback, the stabilization of knowledge distillation, multi-task fine-tuning with explicit instructions, and homogeneous in-batch negative sampling. These optimization strategies contribute to the outstanding empirical performance of the LLM-Embedder.

Unfortunately, MoE's high memory demands and dynamic activation of sparse experts restrict its applicability to real-world problems. Previous solutions that offload MoE's memory-hungry expert parameters to CPU memory fall short because the latency to migrate activated experts from CPU to GPU incurs high performance overhead.

Our method involves constructing an inference cost model that takes into account the characteristics of flash memory, guiding us to optimize in two critical areas: reducing the volume of data transferred from flash and reading data in larger, more contiguous chunks. Within this hardware-informed framework, we introduce two principal techniques. First, \"windowing\" strategically reduces data transfer by reusing previously activated neurons, and second, \"row-column bundling\", tailored to the sequential data access strengths of flash memory, increases the size of data chunks read from flash memory. These methods collectively enable running models up to twice the size of the available DRAM, with a 4-5x and 20-25x increase in inference speed compared to naive loading approaches in CPU and GPU, respectively.

However, these models have efficiency issues as they need to store all the history token-level representations as memory. We present Memformer, an efficient neural network for sequence modeling, that utilizes an external dynamic memory to encode and retrieve past information. Our model achieves linear time complexity and constant memory space complexity when processing long sequences. We also propose a new optimization scheme, memory replay back-propagation (MRBP), which promotes long-range back-propagation through time with a significantly reduced memory requirement. Experimental results show that Memformer has achieved comparable performance compared to the baselines by using 8.1x less memory space and 3.2x faster on inference. Analysis of the attention pattern shows that our external memory slots can encode and retain important information through timesteps."}

Inspired by human brain's memory system and cognitive architectures, we propose a PMI framework that consists of perception, memory and inference components. Notably, the memory module comprises working and long-term memory, with the latter endowed with a higher-order structure to retain extensive and complex relational knowledge and experience. Through a differentiable competitive write access, current perceptions update working memory, which is later merged with long-term memory via outer product associations, reducing information conflicts and averting memory overflow. In the inference module, relevant information is retrieved from two separate memory origins and associatively integrated to attain a more comprehensive and precise interpretation of current perceptions. We exploratively apply our PMI to improve prevailing Transformers and CNN models on question-answering tasks like bAbI-20k and Sort-of-CLEVR datasets, as well as detecting equilateral triangles, language modeling and image classification tasks, and in each case, our PMI enhancements consistently outshine their original counterparts significantly. Visualization analyses reveal that relational memory consolidation, along with the interaction and integration of information from diverse memory sources, substantially contributes to the model effectiveness on inference tasks."}

While traditional methods employ single-time retrieval, more recent approaches have shifted towards multi-time retrieval for multi-hop reasoning tasks. However, these strategies are bound by predefined reasoning steps, potentially leading to inaccuracies in response generation. This paper introduces MetaRAG, an approach that combines the retrieval-augmented generation process with metacognition. Drawing from cognitive psychology, metacognition allows an entity to self-reflect and critically evaluate its cognitive processes. By integrating this, MetaRAG enables the model to monitor, evaluate, and plan its response strategies, enhancing its introspective reasoning abilities. Through a three-step metacognitive regulation pipeline, the model can identify inadequacies in initial cognitive responses and fixes them. Empirical evaluations show that MetaRAG significantly outperforms existing methods."}

Deep learning has employed attention to boost performance for many applications.

Furthermore, multiple complementary attention mechanisms can be incorporated into one network. Hence, attention techniques have become extremely attractive. However, the literature lacks a comprehensive survey on attention techniques to guide researchers in employing attention in their deep models. Note that, besides being demanding in terms of training data and computational resources, transformers only cover a single category in self-attention out of the many categories available. We fill this gap and provide an in-depth survey of 50 attention techniques, categorizing them by their most prominent features. We initiate our discussion by introducing the fundamental concepts behind the success of the attention mechanism. Next, we furnish some essentials such as the strengths and limitations of each attention category, describe their fundamental building blocks, basic formulations with primary usage, and applications specifically for computer vision. We also discuss the challenges and general open questions related to attention mechanisms. Finally, we recommend possible future research directions for deep attention.

Recent studies, (e.g., (Bubeck et al., 2023)) on modern LLMs have shown that they are capable of performing amazing tasks typically necessitating human-level intelligence. However, unlike humans, frozen LLMs do not improve over time; they neither acquire new knowledge nor learn from their successes or failures. Some approaches to improving the intelligence of LLMs include fine-tuning models based on problem-solving performance (Zelikman et al., 2022), and building bigger and more sophisticated models (Bubeck et al., 2023). However, these methods have the drawback of requiring substantial data and computational resources to retrain existing models. In this paper, we explore the use of Retrieval Augmented Generation, also known as RAG (Lewis et al., 2021) to improve problem-solving performance. We propose ARM-RAG (Auxiliary Rationale Memory for Retrieval Augmented Generation), a system that learns from its successes without incurring high training costs. We demonstrate that the storage and subsequent retrieval of reasoning chains have a positive influence on performance in grade-school math problems."}

However, in addition to confidently presenting factually inaccurate information at times (known as \"hallucinations\"), LLMs are also inherently limited by the number of input and output tokens that can be processed at once, making them potentially less effective on tasks that require processing a large set or continuous stream of information. A common approach to reducing the size of data is through lossless or lossy compression. Yet, in some cases it may not be strictly necessary to perfectly recover every detail from the original data, as long as a requisite level of semantic precision or intent is conveyed. This paper presents three contributions to research on LLMs. First, we present the results from experiments exploring the viability of approximate compression using LLMs, focusing specifically on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 via ChatGPT interfaces. Second, we investigate and quantify the capability of LLMs to compress text and code, as well as to recall and manipulate compressed representations of prompts. Third, we present two novel metrics -- Exact Reconstructive Effectiveness (ERE) and Semantic Reconstruction Effectiveness (SRE) -- that quantify the level of preserved intent between text compressed and decompressed by the LLMs we studied. Our initial results indicate that GPT-4 can effectively compress and reconstruct text while preserving the semantic essence of the original text, providing a path to leverage $\\sim$5$\\times$ more tokens than present limits allow."}

However, due to the lack of domain-specific knowledge, they may not be optimal in completing code that requires intensive domain knowledge for example completing the library names. Although there are several works that have confirmed the effectiveness of fine-tuning techniques to adapt language models for code completion in specific domains. They are limited by the need for constant fine-tuning of the model when the project is in constant iteration. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose $k$NM-LM, a retrieval-augmented language model (R-LM), that integrates domain knowledge into language models without fine-tuning. Different from previous techniques, our approach is able to automatically adapt to different language models and domains. Specifically, it utilizes the in-domain code to build the retrieval-based database decoupled from LM, and then combines it with LM through Bayesian inference to complete the code. The extensive experiments on the completion of intra-project and intra-scenario have confirmed that $k$NM-LM brings about appreciable enhancements when compared to CodeGPT and UnixCoder. A deep analysis of our tool including the responding speed, storage usage, specific type code completion, and API invocation completion has confirmed that $k$NM-LM provides satisfactory performance, which renders it highly appropriate for domain adaptive code completion. Furthermore, our approach operates without the requirement for direct access to the language model's parameters. As a result, it can seamlessly integrate with black-box code completion models, making it easy to integrate our approach as a plugin to further enhance the performance of these models."}

To address this, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a popular solution to enhance factual accuracy.

With the advent of generative retrieval (GR), language models can retrieve by directly generating document identifiers (DocIDs), offering superior performance in retrieval tasks. However, the potential relationship between GR and downstream tasks remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{CorpusLM}, a unified language model that leverages external corpus to tackle various knowledge-intensive tasks by integrating generative retrieval, closed-book generation, and RAG through a unified greedy decoding process. We design the following mechanisms to facilitate effective retrieval and generation, and improve the end-to-end effectiveness of KI tasks: (1) We develop a ranking-oriented DocID list generation strategy, which refines GR by directly learning from a DocID ranking list, to improve retrieval quality. (2) We design a continuous DocIDs-References-Answer generation strategy, which facilitates effective and efficient RAG.

This structure is linked to the notion of independent mechanisms from the causality literature, in which a mechanism is able to retain the same processing as irrelevant aspects of the world are changed. For example, convnets enable separation over positions, while attention-based architectures (especially Transformers) learn which combination of positions to process dynamically. In this work we explore a way in which the Transformer architecture is deficient: it represents each position with a large monolithic hidden representation and a single set of parameters which are applied over the entire hidden representation. This potentially throws unrelated sources of information together, and limits the Transformer's ability to capture independent mechanisms. To address this, we propose Transformers with Independent Mechanisms (TIM), a new Transformer layer which divides the hidden representation and parameters into multiple mechanisms, which only exchange information through attention. Additionally, we propose a competition mechanism which encourages these mechanisms to specialize over time steps, and thus be more independent. We study TIM on a large-scale BERT model, on the Image Transformer, and on speech enhancement and find evidence for semantically meaningful specialization as well as improved performance."}

Most of the empirical neuroscience research on working memory has focused on measuring sustained activity in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and/or parietal cortex during simple delayed-response tasks, and most of the models of working memory have been based on neural integrators. But working memory means much more than just holding a piece of information online. We describe a new theory of working memory, based on a recurrent neural circuit that we call ORGaNICs (Oscillatory Recurrent GAted Neural Integrator Circuits). ORGaNICs are a variety of Long Short Term Memory units (LSTMs), imported from machine learning and artificial intelligence. ORGaNICs can be used to explain the complex dynamics of delay-period activity in prefrontal cortex (PFC) during a working memory task. The theory is analytically tractable so that we can characterize the dynamics, and the theory provides a means for reading out information from the dynamically varying responses at any point in time, in spite of the complex dynamics. ORGaNICs can be implemented with a biophysical (electrical circuit) model of pyramidal cells, combined with shunting inhibition via a thalamocortical loop. Although introduced as a computational theory of working memory, ORGaNICs are also applicable to models of sensory processing, motor preparation and motor control. ORGaNICs offer computational advantages compared to other varieties of LSTMs that are commonly used in AI applications. Consequently, ORGaNICs are a framework for canonical computation in brains and machines."}

Here, we propose steps to integrate biologically inspired hierarchical mechanisms to enable advanced problem-solving skills in artificial agents. Therefore, we first review the literature in cognitive psychology to highlight the importance of compositional abstraction and predictive processing. Then we relate the gained insights with contemporary hierarchical reinforcement learning methods. Interestingly, our results suggest that all identified cognitive mechanisms have been implemented individually in isolated computational architectures, raising the question of why there exists no single unifying architecture that integrates them. As our final contribution, we address this question by providing an integrative perspective on the computational challenges to develop such a unifying architecture.

Current research primarily focuses on improving LLMs' cross-lingual generalization capabilities. However, there is still a lack of research on the intrinsic mechanisms of how LLMs achieve cross-lingual alignment. From the perspective of region partitioning, this paper conducts several investigations on the linguistic competence of LLMs. We discover a core region in LLMs that corresponds to linguistic competence, accounting for approximately 1% of the total model parameters. Removing this core region by setting parameters to zero results in a significant performance decrease across 30 different languages. Furthermore, this core region exhibits significant dimensional dependence, perturbations to even a single parameter on specific dimensions leading to a loss of linguistic competence. Moreover, we discover that distinct monolingual regions exist for different languages, and disruption to these specific regions substantially reduces the LLMs' proficiency in those corresponding languages. Our research also indicates that freezing the core linguistic region during further pre-training can mitigate the issue of catastrophic forgetting (CF), a common phenomenon observed during further pre-training of LLMs. Overall, exploring the LLMs' functional regions provides insights into the foundation of their intelligence."}

A recent trend indicates that dynamic architectures based on an expansion of the parameters can reduce catastrophic forgetting efficiently in continual learning. However, existing approaches often require a task identifier at test-time, need complex tuning to balance the growing number of parameters, and barely share any information across tasks. As a result, they struggle to scale to a large number of tasks without significant overhead. In this paper, we propose a transformer architecture based on a dedicated encoder/decoder framework. Critically, the encoder and decoder are shared among all tasks. Through a dynamic expansion of special tokens, we specialize each forward of our decoder network on a task distribution. Our strategy scales to a large number of tasks while having negligible memory and time overheads due to strict control of the parameters expansion. Moreover, this efficient strategy doesn't need any hyperparameter tuning to control the network's expansion.

However, finding architectures with the optimal trade-off between task performance (perplexity) and hardware constraints like peak memory utilization and latency is non-trivial. This is exacerbated by the proliferation of various hardware. We leverage the somewhat surprising empirical observation that the number of decoder parameters in autoregressive Transformers has a high rank correlation with task performance, irrespective of the architecture topology. This observation organically induces a simple Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithm that uses decoder parameters as a proxy for perplexity without need for any model training. The search phase of our training-free algorithm, dubbed Lightweight Transformer Search (LTS), can be run directly on target devices since it does not require GPUs. Using on-target-device measurements, LTS extracts the Pareto-frontier of perplexity versus any hardware performance cost. We evaluate LTS on diverse devices from ARM CPUs to NVIDIA GPUs and two popular autoregressive Transformer backbones: GPT-2 and Transformer-XL. Results show that the perplexity of 16-layer GPT-2 and Transformer-XL can be achieved with up to 1.5x, 2.5x faster runtime and 1.2x, 2.0x lower peak memory utilization. When evaluated in zero and one-shot settings, LTS Pareto-frontier models achieve higher average accuracy compared to the 350M parameter OPT across 14 tasks, with up to 1.6x lower latency.

The quality of the final representation can be measured by a unified objective function called sparse rate reduction. From this perspective, popular deep networks such as transformers can be naturally viewed as realizing iterative schemes to optimize this objective incrementally. Particularly, we show that the standard transformer block can be derived from alternating optimization on complementary parts of this objective: the multi-head self-attention operator can be viewed as a gradient descent step to compress the token sets by minimizing their lossy coding rate, and the subsequent multi-layer perceptron can be viewed as attempting to sparsify the representation of the tokens. This leads to a family of white-box transformer-like deep network architectures which are mathematically fully interpretable. Despite their simplicity, experiments show that these networks indeed learn to optimize the designed objective: they compress and sparsify representations of large-scale real-world vision datasets such as ImageNet, and achieve performance very close to thoroughly engineered transformers such as ViT.

Traditionally, computer memory organization is static - i.e., they do not change based on the application-specific characteristics in memory access behaviour during system operation. Specifically, the association of a data block with a search pattern (or cues) as well as the granularity of a stored data do not evolve. Such a static nature of computer memory, we observe, not only limits the amount of data we can store in a given physical storage, but it also misses the opportunity for dramatic performance improvement in various applications. On the contrary, human memory is characterized by seemingly infinite plasticity in storing and retrieving data - as well as dynamically creating/updating the associations between data and corresponding cues. In this paper, we introduce Neural Storage (NS), a brain-inspired learning memory paradigm that organizes the memory as a flexible neural memory network. In NS, the network structure, strength of associations, and granularity of the data adjust continuously during system operation, providing unprecedented plasticity and performance benefits. We present the associated storage/retrieval/retention algorithms in NS, which integrate a formalized learning process. Using a full-blown operational model, we demonstrate that NS achieves an order of magnitude improvement in memory access performance for two representative applications when compared to traditional content-based memory."}

In particular, there are two characteristic features of intelligence that are essential for knowledge development: forgetting and consolidation. Both plays an important role in knowledge bases and learning systems to avoid possible information overflow and redundancy, and in order to preserve and strengthen important or frequently used rules and remove (or forget) useless ones. We present an incremental, long-life view of knowledge acquisition which tries to improve task after task by determining what to keep, what to consolidate and what to forget, overcoming The Stability-Plasticity dilemma. In order to do that, we rate rules by introducing several metrics through the first adaptation, to our knowledge, of the Minimum Message Length (MML) principle to a coverage graph, a hierarchical assessment structure which treats evidence and rules in a unified way. The metrics are not only used to forget some of the worst rules, but also to set a consolidation process to promote those selected rules to the knowledge base, which is also mirrored by a demotion system. We evaluate the framework with a series of tasks in a chess rule learning domain."}

This paper presents evidence that, despite their size and complexity, LMs sometimes exploit a simple vector arithmetic style mechanism to solve some relational tasks using regularities encoded in the hidden space of the model (e.g., Poland:Warsaw::China:Beijing). We investigate a range of language model sizes (from 124M parameters to 176B parameters) in an in-context learning setting, and find that for a variety of tasks (involving capital cities, uppercasing, and past-tensing) a key part of the mechanism reduces to a simple additive update typically applied by the feedforward (FFN) networks. We further show that this mechanism is specific to tasks that require retrieval from pretraining memory, rather than retrieval from local context. Our results contribute to a growing body of work on the interpretability of LMs, and offer reason to be optimistic that, despite the massive and non-linear nature of the models, the strategies they ultimately use to solve tasks can sometimes reduce to familiar and even intuitive algorithms."}

While prior studies have highlighted the advantages of fine-tuning LLMs, this process incurs high computational costs, making it impractical in resource-scarce environments, particularly for models with billions of parameters. To address these challenges, previous research explored in-context learning (ICL) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) as strategies to guide the LLM generative process with task-specific prompt examples. However, ICL and RAG introduce inconveniences, such as the need for designing contextually relevant prompts and the absence of learning task-specific parameters, thereby limiting downstream task performance. In this context, we foresee parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) as a promising approach to efficiently specialize LLMs to task-specific data while maintaining reasonable resource consumption. In this paper, we deliver a comprehensive study of PEFT techniques for LLMs in the context of automated code generation. Our comprehensive investigation of PEFT techniques for LLMs reveals their superiority and potential over ICL and RAG across a diverse set of LLMs and three representative Python code generation datasets: Conala, CodeAlpacaPy, and APPS. Furthermore, our study highlights the potential for tuning larger LLMs and significant reductions in memory usage by combining PEFT with quantization.

The proposed architecture further enables a single model to support tasks with multiple input modalities as well as asynchronous multi-task learning, thus we refer to it as OmniNet. For example, a single instance of OmniNet can concurrently learn to perform the tasks of part-of-speech tagging, image captioning, visual question answering and video activity recognition. We demonstrate that training these four tasks together results in about three times compressed model while retaining the performance in comparison to training them individually. We also show that using this neural network pre-trained on some modalities assists in learning unseen tasks such as video captioning and video question answering. This illustrates the generalization capacity of the self-attention mechanism on the spatio-temporal cache present in OmniNet."}

Yet vanilla Transformers are notoriously resource-expensive, requiring $O(L^2)$ in serial time and memory as functions of input length $L$. Recent works proposed various linear self-attention mechanisms, scaling only as $O(L)$ for serial computation. We perform a thorough analysis of recent Transformer mechanisms with linear self-attention, Performers, in terms of overall computational complexity. We observe a remarkable computational flexibility: forward and backward propagation can be performed with no approximations using sublinear memory as a function of $L$ (in addition to negligible storage for the input sequence), at a cost of greater time complexity in the parallel setting. In the extreme case, a Performer consumes only $O(1)$ memory during training, and still requires $O(L)$ time. This discovered time-memory tradeoff can be used for training or, due to complete backward-compatibility, for fine-tuning on a low-memory device, e.g. a smartphone or an earlier-generation GPU, thus contributing towards decentralized and democratized deep learning."}

Tested on a task designed to probe a LM's ability to keep track of multiple fact updates, a MemoryPrompt-augmented LM outperforms much larger LMs that have access to the full input history. We also test MemoryPrompt on a long-distance dialogue dataset, where its performance is comparable to that of a model conditioned on the entire conversation history. In both experiments we also observe that, unlike full-finetuning approaches, MemoryPrompt does not suffer from catastrophic forgetting when adapted to new tasks, thus not disrupting the generalist capabilities of the underlying LM."}

To address this, we propose a framework, Language Models Augmented with Long-Term Memory (LongMem), which enables LLMs to memorize long history. We design a novel decoupled network architecture with the original backbone LLM frozen as a memory encoder and an adaptive residual side-network as a memory retriever and reader. Such a decoupled memory design can easily cache and update long-term past contexts for memory retrieval without suffering from memory staleness. Enhanced with memory-augmented adaptation training, LongMem can thus memorize long past context and use long-term memory for language modeling. The proposed memory retrieval module can handle unlimited-length context in its memory bank to benefit various downstream tasks. Typically, LongMem can enlarge the long-form memory to 65k tokens and thus cache many-shot extra demonstration examples as long-form memory for in-context learning. Experiments show that our method outperforms strong long-context models on ChapterBreak, a challenging long-context modeling benchmark, and achieves remarkable improvements on memory-augmented in-context learning over LLMs. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in helping language models to memorize and utilize long-form contents.

First, exemplar pools are created to represent the types of contexts where each LM provides a more reliable answer, leveraging a sentence embedding fine-tuned so that context similarity is close to dialogue state similarity. Then, during inference, the k-nearest exemplars to the testing instance are retrieved, and the instance is routed according to majority vote.

We show that, for sequences longer than the attention head dimension, attention weights are not identifiable. We propose effective attention as a complementary tool for improving explanatory interpretations based on attention. Furthermore, we show that input tokens retain to a large degree their identity across the model. We also find evidence suggesting that identity information is mainly encoded in the angle of the embeddings and gradually decreases with depth. Finally, we demonstrate strong mixing of input information in the generation of contextual embeddings by means of a novel quantification method based on gradient attribution.

To address this issue, particularly in retrieval-augmented in-context learning, we introduce the hierarchical graph of thoughts (HGOT), a structured, multi-layered graph approach designed to enhance the retrieval of pertinent passages during in-context learning. The framework utilizes the emergent planning capabilities of LLMs, employing the divide-and-conquer strategy to break down complex queries into manageable sub-queries. It refines self-consistency majority voting for answer selection, which incorporates the recently proposed citation recall and precision metrics to assess the quality of thoughts, linking an answer's credibility intrinsically to the thought's quality. This methodology introduces a weighted system in majority voting, prioritizing answers based on the citation quality of their thoughts. Additionally, we propose a scoring mechanism for evaluating retrieved passages, considering factors such as citation frequency and quality, self-consistency confidence, and the retrieval module's ranking.

CoPS employs LLMs to enhance user modeling and user search experience. The cognitive memory mechanism comprises sensory memory for quick sensory responses, working memory for sophisticated cognitive responses, and long-term memory for storing historical interactions. CoPS handles new queries using a three-step approach: identifying re-finding behaviors, constructing user profiles with relevant historical information, and ranking documents based on personalized query intent.

We find that LMs struggle with less popular factual knowledge, and that scaling fails to appreciably improve memorization of factual knowledge in the long tail. We then show that retrieval-augmented LMs largely outperform orders of magnitude larger LMs, while unassisted LMs remain competitive in questions about high-popularity entities. Based on those findings, we devise a simple, yet effective, method for powerful and efficient retrieval-augmented LMs, which retrieves non-parametric memories only when necessary. Experimental results show that this significantly improves models' performance while reducing the inference costs."}

Quantization techniques, which reduce the bits needed for model weights or activations with minimal performance loss, have become popular due to the rise of LLMs. However, most quantization studies use pre-trained LLMs, and the impact of quantization on instruction-tuned LLMs and the relationship between perplexity and benchmark performance of quantized LLMs are not well understood. Evaluation of quantized LLMs is often limited to language modeling and a few classification tasks, leaving their performance on other benchmarks unclear. To address these gaps, we propose a structured evaluation framework consisting of three critical dimensions: (1) knowledge \\& capacity, (2) alignment, and (3) efficiency, and conduct extensive experiments across ten diverse benchmarks. Our experimental results indicate that LLMs with 4-bit quantization can retain performance comparable to their non-quantized counterparts, and perplexity can serve as a proxy metric for quantized LLMs on most benchmarks. Furthermore, quantized LLMs with larger parameter scales can outperform smaller LLMs. Despite the memory savings achieved through quantization, it can also slow down the inference speed of LLMs. Consequently, substantial engineering efforts and hardware support are imperative to achieve a balanced optimization of decoding speed and memory consumption in the context of quantized LLMs."}

While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods aim to reduce the memory usage of the optimizer state during fine-tuning, the inherent size of pre-trained LLM weights continues to be a pressing concern. Even though quantization techniques are widely proposed to ease memory demands and accelerate LLM inference, most of these techniques are geared towards the deployment phase. To bridge this gap, this paper presents Parameter-Efficient and Quantization-aware Adaptation (PEQA) - a simple yet effective method that combines the advantages of PEFT with quantized LLMs. By updating solely the quantization scales, PEQA can be directly applied to quantized LLMs, ensuring seamless task transitions. Parallel to existing PEFT methods, PEQA significantly reduces the memory overhead associated with the optimizer state. Furthermore, it leverages the advantages of quantization to substantially reduce model sizes. Even after fine-tuning, the quantization structure of a PEQA-tuned LLM remains intact, allowing for accelerated inference on the deployment stage. We employ PEQA-tuning for task-specific adaptation on LLMs with up to 65 billion parameters. To assess the logical reasoning and language comprehension of PEQA-tuned LLMs, we fine-tune low-bit quantized LLMs using a instruction dataset. Our results show that even when LLMs are quantized to below 4-bit precision, their capabilities in language modeling, few-shot in-context learning, and comprehension can be resiliently restored to (or even improved over) their full-precision original performances with PEQA."}

However, it also faces critical challenges due to the substantial memory requirement of LLMs. Quantization is an effective way of reducing the model size while maintaining good performance. However, even after quantization, LLMs may still be too big to fit entirely into the limited memory of edge or mobile devices and have to be partially loaded from the storage to complete the inference. In this case, the I/O latency of model loading becomes the bottleneck of the LLM inference latency. In this work, we take a preliminary step of studying applying data compression techniques to reduce data movement and thus speed up the inference of quantized LLM on memory-constrained devices. In particular, we discussed the compressibility of quantized LLMs, the trade-off between the compressibility and performance of quantized LLMs, and opportunities to optimize both of them jointly."}

This paper addresses these challenges by focusing on the quantization of LLMs, a technique that reduces memory consumption by converting model parameters and activations into low-bit integers. We critically analyze the existing quantization approaches, identifying their limitations in balancing the accuracy and efficiency of the quantized LLMs. To advance beyond these limitations, we propose WKVQuant, a PTQ framework especially designed for quantizing weights and the key/value (KV) cache of LLMs. Specifically, we incorporates past-only quantization to improve the computation of attention. Additionally, we introduce two-dimensional quantization strategy to handle the distribution of KV cache, along with a cross-block reconstruction regularization for parameter optimization. Experiments show that WKVQuant achieves almost comparable memory savings to weight-activation quantization, while also approaching the performance of weight-only quantization."}

Hosting these models at scale requires significant memory resources. One crucial memory bottleneck for the deployment stems from the context window. It is commonly recognized that model weights are memory hungry; however, the size of key-value embedding stored during the generation process (KV cache) can easily surpass the model size. The enormous size of the KV cache puts constraints on the inference batch size, which is crucial for high throughput inference workload. Inspired by an interesting observation of the attention scores, we hypothesize the persistence of importance: only pivotal tokens, which had a substantial influence at one step, will significantly influence future generations. Based on our empirical verification and theoretical analysis around this hypothesis, we propose Scissorhands, a system that maintains the memory usage of the KV cache at a fixed budget without finetuning the model. In essence, Scissorhands manages the KV cache by storing the pivotal tokens with a higher probability. We validate that Scissorhands reduces the inference memory usage of the KV cache by up to 5X without compromising model quality. We further demonstrate that Scissorhands can be combined with 4-bit quantization, traditionally used to compress model weights, to achieve up to 20X compression."}

However, training these models poses a challenge for most researchers as it requires a substantial number of GPUs. To reduce GPU memory usage, memory partitioning, and memory offloading have been proposed. These approaches eliminate memory redundancies and offload memory usage to the CPU and NVMe memory, respectively, enabling training on small GPU clusters. However, directly deploying these solutions often leads to suboptimal efficiency. Only experienced experts can unleash the full potential of hardware by carefully tuning the distributed configuration. Thus, we present a novel solution, Elixir, which automates efficient large-model training based on pre-runtime model profiling. Elixir aims to identify the optimal combination of partitioning and offloading techniques to maximize training throughput. In our experiments, Elixir significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art baseline. Our optimal configuration achieves up to a 3.4$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 models compared with SOTA solutions. We hope that our work will benefit individuals who lack computing resources and expertise, granting them access to large models. The beta version of Elixir is now available at https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI/tree/feature/elixir."}

It is a fully-featured toolkit, allowing users to create a complete train/test pipeline in a few lines of code.

In particular, complex training algorithms can be easily modified and combined, thanks to a system of composable, lazily-evaluated hooks.

However, from fallacious and naive groundings regarding complex adaptive systems to datasets underlying models, these systems are beset by problems, challenges, and limitations. They remain opaque and unreliable, and fail to consider societal and structural oppressive systems, disproportionately negatively impacting those at the margins of society while benefiting the most powerful. The various challenges, problems and pitfalls of these systems are a hot topic of research in various areas, such as critical data/algorithm studies, science and technology studies (STS), embodied and enactive cognitive science, complexity science, Afro-feminism, and the broadly construed emerging field of Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAccT). Yet, these fields of enquiry often proceed in silos. This thesis weaves together seemingly disparate fields of enquiry to examine core scientific and ethical challenges, pitfalls, and problems of AI. In this thesis I, a) review the historical and cultural ecology from which AI research emerges, b) examine the shaky scientific grounds of machine prediction of complex behaviour illustrating how predicting complex behaviour with precision is impossible in principle, c) audit large scale datasets behind current AI demonstrating how they embed societal historical and structural injustices, d) study the seemingly neutral values of ML research and put forward 67 prominent values underlying ML research, e) examine some of the insidious and worrying applications of computer vision research, and f) put forward a framework for approaching challenges, failures and problems surrounding ML systems as well as alternative ways forward."}

In this context, in his latest book, titled Thinking Fast and Slow [8], Kahneman [7,8] provides further theoretical interpretation by differentiating the two assumed systems of the cognitive functioning of the human mind. He calls them intuition (system 1) determined to be an associative (automatic, fast and perceptual) machine, and reasoning (system 2) required to be voluntary and to operate logical- deductively. In this paper, we propose an ansatz inspired by Ausubel's learning theory for investigating, from the constructivist perspective [9-12], information processing in the working memory of cognizers. Specifically, a thought experiment is performed utilizing the mind of a dual-natured creature known as Maxwell's demon: a tiny \"man-machine\" solely equipped with the characteristics of system 1, which prevents it from reasoning. The calculation presented here shows that [...]. This result indicates that when the system 2 is shut down, both an intelligent being, as well as a binary machine, incur the same energy cost per unit of information processed, which mathematically proves the computational attribute of the system 1, as Kahneman [7,8] theorized. This finding links information theory to human psychological features and opens a new path toward the conception of a multi-bit reasoning machine."}

While this approach has proven to be quite fruitful for meaningless material such as random lists of words, naturalistic stimuli, like narratives, have until now resisted such a large-scale study, due to the quantity of manual labor required to design and analyze such experiments. In this work, we develop a pipeline that uses large language models (LLMs) both to design naturalistic narrative stimuli for large-scale recall and recognition memory experiments, as well as to analyze the results. We performed online memory experiments with a large number of participants and collected recognition and recall data for narratives of different sizes. We found that both recall and recognition performance scale linearly with narrative length; however, for longer narratives people tend to summarize the content rather than recalling precise details. To investigate the role of narrative comprehension in memory, we repeated these experiments using scrambled versions of the narratives. Although recall performance declined significantly, recognition remained largely unaffected. Recalls in this condition seem to follow the original narrative order rather than the actual scrambled presentation, pointing to a contextual reconstruction of the story in memory. Finally, using LLM text embeddings, we construct a simple measure for each clause based on semantic similarity to the whole narrative, that shows a strong correlation with recall probability. Overall, our work demonstrates the power of LLMs in accessing new regimes in the study of human memory, as well as suggesting novel psychologically informed benchmarks for LLM performance."}
