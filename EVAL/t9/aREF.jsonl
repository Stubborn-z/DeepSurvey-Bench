It is regarded as crucial for the development of advanced text generation technologies that better meet the specific constraints in practical applications. In recent years, methods using large-scale pre-trained language models (PLMs), in particular the widely used transformer-based PLMs, have become a new paradigm of NLG, allowing generation of more diverse and fluent text. However, due to the limited level of interpretability of deep neural networks, the controllability of these methods need to be guaranteed. To this end, controllable text generation using transformer-based PLMs has become a rapidly growing yet challenging new research hotspot. A diverse range of approaches have emerged in the recent 3-4 years, targeting different CTG tasks that require different types of controlled constraints. In this paper, we present a systematic critical review on the common tasks, main approaches, and evaluation methods in this area. Finally, we discuss the challenges that the field is facing, and put forward various promising future directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey paper to summarize the state-of-the-art CTG techniques from the perspective of Transformer-based PLMs. We hope it can help researchers and practitioners in the related fields to quickly track the academic and technological frontier, providing them with a landscape of the area and a roadmap for future research."}

Previous approaches, such as plug-and-play controllers (PPCs), aimed to steer the properties of generated text in a flexible manner. However, these methods often compromised the integrity of the language model's decoding process, resulting in less smooth text generation. Alternatively, other techniques utilized multiple attribute prompts to align the generated text with desired attributes, but this approach required prompt design for each attribute and was dependent on the size of the language model. This paper introduces a novel method for flexible attribute control in text generation using pre-trained language models (PLMs). The proposed approach aims to enhance the fluency of generated text by guiding the generation process with PPCs. The key idea is to dynamically adjust the distribution of generated text by modifying prompts, effectively constraining the output space of the language model and influencing the desired attribute. To enable smooth cooperation between the PLM and the PPC, our work innovatively proposes a new model fine-tuning method: Reinforcement Learning with Dynamic Adjust Feedback (RLDAF).This fine-tuning process adapts a small subset of the language model's parameters based on the generating actions taken during the PPC control process. The resulting harmonious collaboration between the PLM and PPC leads to improved smoothness in text generation during inference. Extensive experiments were conducted on the SST2 dataset, and the proposed method outperformed previous approaches in various evaluation metrics, including text fluency and attribute consistency."}

However, in practice, they are hard to control for creative purposes. We describe a Plug-and-Play controllable language generation framework, Plug-and-Blend, that allows a human user to input multiple control codes (topics). In the context of automated story generation, this allows a human user loose or fine-grained control of the topics and transitions between them that will appear in the generated story, and can even allow for overlapping, blended topics. Automated evaluations show our framework, working with different generative LMs, controls the generation towards given continuous-weighted control codes while keeping the generated sentences fluent, demonstrating strong blending capability. A human participant evaluation shows that the generated stories are observably transitioning between two topics."}

In this paper, we propose a controllable dialogue generation model to steer response generation under multi-attribute constraints. Specifically, we define and categorize the commonly used control attributes into global and local ones, which possess different granularities of effects on response generation. Then, we significantly extend the conventional seq2seq framework by introducing a novel two-stage decoder, which first uses a multi-grained style specification layer to impose the stylistic constraints and determine word-level control states of responses based on the attributes, and then employs a response generation layer to generate final responses maintaining both semantic relevancy to the contexts and fidelity to the attributes. Furthermore, we train our model with an attribute consistency reward to promote response control with explicit supervision signals. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses on two datasets indicate that our model can significantly outperform competitive baselines in terms of response quality, content diversity and controllability."}

Especially, poetry generation is a typical one with well-defined and strict conditions for text generation which is an ideal playground for the assessment of current methodologies. While prior works succeeded in controlling either semantic or metrical aspects of poetry generation, simultaneously addressing both remains a challenge. In this paper, we pioneer the use of the Diffusion model for generating sonnets and Chinese SongCi poetry to tackle such challenges. In terms of semantics, our PoetryDiffusion model, built upon the Diffusion model, generates entire sentences or poetry by comprehensively considering the entirety of sentence information. This approach enhances semantic expression, distinguishing it from autoregressive and large language models (LLMs). For metrical control, the separation feature of diffusion generation and its constraint control module enable us to flexibly incorporate a novel metrical controller to manipulate and evaluate metrics (format and rhythm). The denoising process in PoetryDiffusion allows for gradual enhancement of semantics and flexible integration of the metrical controller which can calculate and impose penalties on states that stray significantly from the target control distribution. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing models in automatic evaluation of semantic, metrical, and overall performance as well as human evaluation."}

Building upon the idea of adversarial triggers, we develop a method to induce societal biases in generated text when input prompts contain mentions of specific demographic groups. We then analyze two scenarios: 1) inducing negative biases for one demographic and positive biases for another demographic, and 2) equalizing biases between demographics. The former scenario enables us to detect the types of biases present in the model. Specifically, we show the effectiveness of our approach at facilitating bias analysis by finding topics that correspond to demographic inequalities in generated text and comparing the relative effectiveness of inducing biases for different demographics. The second scenario is useful for mitigating biases in downstream applications such as dialogue generation. In our experiments, the mitigation technique proves to be effective at equalizing the amount of biases across demographics while simultaneously generating less negatively biased text overall."}

Existing works have made a series of progress in incorporating unimodal controls into language models (LMs), whereas how to generate controllable sentences with multimodal signals and high efficiency remains an open question. To tackle the puzzle, we propose a new paradigm of zero-shot controllable text generation with multimodal signals (\\textsc{ZeroGen}). Specifically, \\textsc{ZeroGen} leverages controls of text and image successively from token-level to sentence-level and maps them into a unified probability space at decoding, which customizes the LM outputs by weighted addition without extra training. To achieve better inter-modal trade-offs, we further introduce an effective dynamic weighting mechanism to regulate all control weights. Moreover, we conduct substantial experiments to probe the relationship of being in-depth or in-width between signals from distinct modalities. Encouraging empirical results on three downstream tasks show that \\textsc{ZeroGen} not only outperforms its counterparts on captioning tasks by a large margin but also shows great potential in multimodal news generation with a higher degree of control.

Although there are many methods on Transformer acceleration, they are still either inefficient on long sequences or not effective enough. In this paper, we propose Fastformer, which is an efficient Transformer model based on additive attention. In Fastformer, instead of modeling the pair-wise interactions between tokens, we first use additive attention mechanism to model global contexts, and then further transform each token representation based on its interaction with global context representations. In this way, Fastformer can achieve effective context modeling with linear complexity. Extensive experiments on five datasets show that Fastformer is much more efficient than many existing Transformer models and can meanwhile achieve comparable or even better long text modeling performance."}

It is essential desirable for outputs from text generation systems like summarization, question answering, machine translation, question generation, table-to-text, etc. An automated coherence scoring model is also helpful in essay scoring or providing writing feedback. A large body of previous work has leveraged entity-based methods, syntactic patterns, discourse relations, and more recently traditional deep learning architectures for text coherence assessment. Previous work suffers from drawbacks like the inability to handle long-range dependencies, out-of-vocabulary words, or model sequence information. We hypothesize that coherence assessment is a cognitively complex task that requires deeper models and can benefit from other related tasks. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose four different Transformer-based architectures for the task: vanilla Transformer, hierarchical Transformer, multi-task learning-based model, and a model with fact-based input representation. Our experiments with popular benchmark datasets across multiple domains on four different coherence assessment tasks demonstrate that our models achieve state-of-the-art results outperforming existing models by a good margin."}

Yet, while the T5 generated questions have a reasonable quality compared to the state-of-the-art method for the task (KPCNet), many of such questions are still too general, resulting in a sub-optimal global question diversity. As an alternative, we propose a novel learning-to-diversify (LTD) fine-tuning approach that allows to enrich the language learned by the underlying Transformer model.

We propose a framework that alleviates this data constraint by jointly training a grounded generator and document retriever on the language model signal. The model learns to reward retrieval of the documents with the highest utility in generation, and attentively combines them using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) ensemble to generate follow-on text. We demonstrate that both generator and retriever can take advantage of this joint training and work synergistically to produce more informative and relevant text in both prose and dialogue generation."}

However, when the generation tasks are more open-ended and the content is under-specified, existing techniques struggle to generate long-term coherent and creative content. Moreover, the models exhibit and even amplify social biases that are learned from the training corpora.

In this work, we study whether informational feedback in natural language can be leveraged to improve generation quality and user preference alignment. To this end, we consider factual consistency in summarization, the quality that the summary should only contain information supported by the input documents, as the user-expected preference. We collect a high-quality dataset, DeFacto, containing human demonstrations and informational natural language feedback consisting of corrective instructions, edited summaries, and explanations with respect to the factual consistency of the summary. Using our dataset, we study three natural language generation tasks: (1) editing a summary by following the human feedback, (2) generating human feedback for editing the original summary, and (3) revising the initial summary to correct factual errors by generating both the human feedback and edited summary. We show that DeFacto can provide factually consistent human-edited summaries and further insights into summarization factual consistency thanks to its informational natural language feedback. We further demonstrate that fine-tuned language models can leverage our dataset to improve the summary factual consistency, while large language models lack the zero-shot learning ability in our proposed tasks that require controllable text generation."}

Also, we show that we can improve the controllability of LLMs with keyword-based classifier-free guidance (CFG) while achieving lexical overlap comparable to strong fine-tuned baselines on arXiv and PubMed. However, our results also indicate that LLMs cannot consistently generate long summaries with more than 8 sentences.

Experiments show that there exist steering vectors, which, when added to the hidden states of the language model, generate a target sentence nearly perfectly (> 99 BLEU) for English sentences from a variety of domains. We show that vector arithmetic can be used for unsupervised sentiment transfer on the Yelp sentiment benchmark, with performance comparable to models tailored to this task. We find that distances between steering vectors reflect sentence similarity when evaluated on a textual similarity benchmark (STS-B), outperforming pooled hidden states of models. Finally, we present an analysis of the intrinsic properties of the steering vectors. Taken together, our results suggest that frozen LMs can be effectively controlled through their latent steering space."}

Consequently, those aligned large language models refuse to generate undesired content when facing potentially harmful/unethical requests. A natural question is \"could alignment really prevent those open-sourced large language models from being misused to generate undesired content?''. In this work, we provide a negative answer to this question. In particular, we show those open-sourced, aligned large language models could be easily misguided to generate undesired content without heavy computations or careful prompt designs. Our key idea is to directly manipulate the generation process of open-sourced LLMs to misguide it to generate undesired content including harmful or biased information and even private data.

This paper proposes to formulate controllable text generation from a principled causal perspective which models the two tasks with a unified framework. A direct advantage of the causal formulation is the use of rich causality tools to mitigate generation biases and improve control. We treat the two tasks as interventional and counterfactual causal inference based on a structural causal model, respectively. We then apply the framework to the challenging practical setting where confounding factors (that induce spurious correlations) are observable only on a small fraction of data. Experiments show significant superiority of the causal approach over previous conditional models for improved control accuracy and reduced bias."}

While that approach can capture the latent structure of the text, it is inherently constrained to sequential dynamics for text generation. We propose a new paradigm for introducing a syntactic inductive bias into neural text generation, where the dependency parse tree is used to drive the Transformer model to generate sentences iteratively. Our experiments show that this paradigm is effective at text generation, with quality between LSTMs and Transformers, and comparable diversity, requiring less than half their decoding steps, and its generation process allows direct control over the syntactic constructions of the generated text, enabling the induction of stylistic variations."}

However, controlling attributes of the generated language (e.g. switching topic or sentiment) is difficult without modifying the model architecture or fine-tuning on attribute-specific data and entailing the significant cost of retraining. We propose a simple alternative: the Plug and Play Language Model (PPLM) for controllable language generation, which combines a pretrained LM with one or more simple attribute classifiers that guide text generation without any further training of the LM. In the canonical scenario we present, the attribute models are simple classifiers consisting of a user-specified bag of words or a single learned layer with 100,000 times fewer parameters than the LM. Sampling entails a forward and backward pass in which gradients from the attribute model push the LM's hidden activations and thus guide the generation. Model samples demonstrate control over a range of topics and sentiment styles, and extensive automated and human annotated evaluations show attribute alignment and fluency. PPLMs are flexible in that any combination of differentiable attribute models may be used to steer text generation, which will allow for diverse and creative applications beyond the examples given in this paper."}

However, current interactive writing assistants do not allow authors to guide text generation in desired topical directions. To address this limitation, we design a framework that displays multiple candidate upcoming topics, of which a user can select a subset to guide the generation. Our framework consists of two components: (1) a method that produces a set of candidate topics by predicting the centers of word clusters in the possible continuations, and (2) a text generation model whose output adheres to the chosen topics. The training of both components is self-supervised, using only unlabeled text. Our experiments demonstrate that our topic options are better than those of standard clustering approaches, and our framework often generates fluent sentences related to the chosen topics, as judged by automated metrics and crowdsourced workers."}

Although several survey papers have been published highlighting the transformer's contributions in specific fields, architectural differences, or performance evaluations, there is still a significant absence of a comprehensive survey paper encompassing its major applications across various domains. Therefore, we undertook the task of filling this gap by conducting an extensive survey of proposed transformer models from 2017 to 2022. Our survey encompasses the identification of the top five application domains for transformer-based models, namely: NLP, Computer Vision, Multi-Modality, Audio and Speech Processing, and Signal Processing. We analyze the impact of highly influential transformer-based models in these domains and subsequently classify them based on their respective tasks using a proposed taxonomy.

In particular, the decoder-only generative models, such as generative pre-trained transformer (GPT), are widely used for text generation, with two major computational stages: summarization and generation. Unlike the summarization stage, which can process the input tokens in parallel, the generation stage is difficult to accelerate due to its sequential generation of output tokens through iteration. Moreover, each iteration requires reading a whole model with little data reuse opportunity. Therefore, the workload of transformer-based text generation is severely memory-bound, making the external memory bandwidth system bottleneck. In this paper, we proposed a subarray-level processing-in-memory architecture named SAL-PIM, HBM-based PIM architecture for the end-to-end acceleration of transformer-based text generation. The SAL-PIM architecture includes three architectural features. First, the SAL-PIM architecture utilizes higher internal bandwidth by integrating multiple subarray-level arithmetic logic units with optimized data mapping schemes. Second, the SAL-PIM architecture adopts LUT-based linear interpolation to perform complex non-linear functions in PIM. Third, the SAL-PIM architecture accelerates end-to-end inference on PIM in text generation. Furthermore, to validate the SAL-PIM architecture, we built cycle-accurate simulator and implemented the SAL-PIM's logic units in 28-nm CMOS technology. As a result, when the input size is from 32 to 128 and the output size is from 1 to 256, SAL-PIM achieves a maximum of 4.72 times speedup and an average of 1.83 times speedup for the text generation based on the GPT-2 medium model compared to the server-level GPU."}

The \"Structural Scaffold\" idea guides the language model's representation via additional structure loss that separately predicts the incremental constituency parse. We train the proposed models along with a vanilla Transformer language model baseline on a 14 million-token and a 46 million-token subset of the BLLIP dataset, and evaluate models' syntactic generalization performances on SG Test Suites and sized BLiMP.

Spurious correlations in the training data can lead models to incorrectly rely on parts of the input other than the control code for attribute selection, significantly undermining downstream generation quality and controllability. We demonstrate the severity of this issue with a series of case studies and then propose two simple techniques to reduce these correlations in training sets. The first technique is based on resampling the data according to an example's propensity towards each linguistic attribute (IPS). The second produces multiple counterfactual versions of each example and then uses an additional feedback mechanism to remove noisy examples (feedback aware self-training, FAST). We evaluate on 3 tasks -- news headline, meta review, and search ads generation -- and demonstrate that FAST can significantly improve the controllability and language quality of generated outputs when compared to state-of-the-art controllable text generation approaches."}

The Transformer has improved the state-of-the-art across numerous sequence modelling tasks. However, its effectiveness comes at the expense of a quadratic computational and memory complexity with respect to the sequence length, hindering its adoption. Fortunately, the deep learning community has always been interested in improving the models' efficiency, leading to a plethora of solutions such as parameter sharing, pruning, mixed-precision, and knowledge distillation. Recently, researchers have directly addressed the Transformer's limitation by designing lower-complexity alternatives such as the Longformer, Reformer, Linformer, and Performer. However, due to the wide range of solutions, it has become challenging for researchers and practitioners to determine which methods to apply in practice in order to meet the desired trade-off between capacity, computation, and memory.

We propose RFA, a linear time and space attention that uses random feature methods to approximate the softmax function, and explore its application in transformers. RFA can be used as a drop-in replacement for conventional softmax attention and offers a straightforward way of learning with recency bias through an optional gating mechanism. Experiments on language modeling and machine translation demonstrate that RFA achieves similar or better performance compared to strong transformer baselines. In the machine translation experiment, RFA decodes twice as fast as a vanilla transformer. Compared to existing efficient transformer variants, RFA is competitive in terms of both accuracy and efficiency on three long text classification datasets. Our analysis shows that RFA's efficiency gains are especially notable on long sequences, suggesting that RFA will be particularly useful in tasks that require working with large inputs, fast decoding speed, or low memory footprints."}

In particular, existing transformer-based 3D image registration architectures face two critical gaps that challenge their efficiency and effectiveness. Firstly, although window-based attention mechanisms reduce the quadratic complexity of full attention by focusing on local regions, they often struggle to effectively integrate both local and global information.

Thanks to the autoregressive characteristic of LLM inference, KV caching for the attention layers in Transformers can effectively accelerate LLM inference by substituting quadratic-complexity computation with linear-complexity memory accesses. Yet, this approach requires increasing memory as demand grows for processing longer sequences. The overhead leads to reduced throughput due to I/O bottlenecks and even out-of-memory errors, particularly on resource-constrained systems like a single commodity GPU. In this paper, we propose ALISA, a novel algorithm-system co-design solution to address the challenges imposed by KV caching. On the algorithm level, ALISA prioritizes tokens that are most important in generating a new token via a Sparse Window Attention (SWA) algorithm. SWA introduces high sparsity in attention layers and reduces the memory footprint of KV caching at negligible accuracy loss. On the system level, ALISA employs three-phase token-level dynamical scheduling and optimizes the trade-off between caching and recomputation, thus maximizing the overall performance in resource-constrained systems. In a single GPU-CPU system, we demonstrate that under varying workloads, ALISA improves the throughput of baseline systems such as FlexGen and vLLM by up to 3X and 1.9X, respectively."}

Current state-of-the-art models, via a large number of parameters and pre-training on massive text corpus, have shown impressive results on several downstream tasks. Many researchers have studied previous (non-Transformer) models to understand their actual behavior under different scenarios, showing that these models are taking advantage of clues or failures of datasets and that slight perturbations on the input data can severely reduce their performance. In contrast, recent models have not been systematically tested with adversarial-examples in order to show their robustness under severe stress conditions. For that reason, this work evaluates three Transformer-based models (RoBERTa, XLNet, and BERT) in Natural Language Inference (NLI) and Question Answering (QA) tasks to know if they are more robust or if they have the same flaws as their predecessors. As a result, our experiments reveal that RoBERTa, XLNet and BERT are more robust than recurrent neural network models to stress tests for both NLI and QA tasks. Nevertheless, they are still very fragile and demonstrate various unexpected behaviors, thus revealing that there is still room for future improvement in this field."}

However, recent studies show their vulnerability to textual adversarial attacks where the model's output can be misled by intentionally manipulating the text inputs. Despite various methods that have been proposed to enhance the model's robustness and mitigate this vulnerability, many require heavy consumption resources (e.g., adversarial training) or only provide limited protection (e.g., defensive dropout). In this paper, we propose a novel method called dynamic attention, tailored for the transformer architecture, to enhance the inherent robustness of the model itself against various adversarial attacks. Our method requires no downstream task knowledge and does not incur additional costs. The proposed dynamic attention consists of two modules: (I) attention rectification, which masks or weakens the attention value of the chosen tokens, and (ii) dynamic modeling, which dynamically builds the set of candidate tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that dynamic attention significantly mitigates the impact of adversarial attacks, improving up to 33\\% better performance than previous methods against widely-used adversarial attacks. The model-level design of dynamic attention enables it to be easily combined with other defense methods (e.g., adversarial training) to further enhance the model's robustness. Furthermore, we demonstrate that dynamic attention preserves the state-of-the-art robustness space of the original model compared to other dynamic modeling methods."}

Analyzing Bias in Transformer-Based Language Model Attention Heads", "abstract": "Transformer-based pretrained large language models (PLM) such as BERT and GPT have achieved remarkable success in NLP tasks. However, PLMs are prone to encoding stereotypical biases. Although a burgeoning literature has emerged on stereotypical bias mitigation in PLMs, such as work on debiasing gender and racial stereotyping, how such biases manifest and behave internally within PLMs remains largely unknown. Understanding the internal stereotyping mechanisms may allow better assessment of model fairness and guide the development of effective mitigation strategies. In this work, we focus on attention heads, a major component of the Transformer architecture, and propose a bias analysis framework to explore and identify a small set of biased heads that are found to contribute to a PLM's stereotypical bias. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the existence of these biased heads and to better understand how they behave. We investigate gender and racial bias in the English language in two types of Transformer-based PLMs: the encoder-based BERT model and the decoder-based autoregressive GPT model. Overall, the results shed light on understanding the bias behavior in pretrained language models."}

While the number of research works involving neural LMs is exponentially increasing, their vast majority are high-level and far from self-contained. Consequently, a deep understanding of the literature in this area is a tough task especially in the absence of a unified mathematical framework explaining the main types of neural LMs. We address the aforementioned problem in this tutorial where the objective is to explain neural LMs in a detailed, simplified and unambiguous mathematical framework accompanied by clear graphical illustrations. Concrete examples on widely used models like BERT and GPT2 are explored. Finally, since transformers pretrained on language-modeling-like tasks have been widely adopted in computer vision and time series applications, we briefly explore some examples of such solutions in order to enable readers to understand how transformers work in the aforementioned domains and compare this use with the original one in NLP."}

Ideally, when models are pre-trained on large amount of data, they are expected to gain implicit knowledge. In this paper, we investigate the ability of pre-trained language models to generalize to different non-language tasks. In particular, we test them on tasks from different domains such as computer vision, reasoning on hierarchical data, and protein fold prediction. The four pre-trained models that we used, T5, BART, BERT, and GPT-2 achieve outstanding results. They all have similar performance and they outperform transformers that are trained from scratch by a large margin. For instance, pre-trained language models perform better on the Listops dataset, with an average accuracy of 58.7\\%, compared to transformers trained from scratch, which have an average accuracy of 29.0\\%. The significant improvement demonstrated across three types of datasets suggests that pre-training on language helps the models to acquire general knowledge, bringing us a step closer to general AI. We also showed that reducing the number of parameters in pre-trained language models does not have a great impact as the performance drops slightly when using T5-Small instead of T5-Base. In fact, when using only 2\\% of the parameters, we achieved a great improvement compared to training from scratch. Finally, in contrast to prior work, we find out that using pre-trained embeddings for the input layer is necessary to achieve the desired results."}

The Transformer, for instance, is an illustrative example that generates abstract representations of tokens inputted to an encoder based on their relationships to all tokens in a sequence. Recent studies have shown that although such models are capable of learning syntactic features purely by seeing examples, explicitly feeding this information to deep learning models can significantly enhance their performance. Leveraging syntactic information like part of speech (POS) may be particularly beneficial in limited training data settings for complex models such as the Transformer. We show that the syntax-infused Transformer with multiple features achieves an improvement of 0.7 BLEU when trained on the full WMT 14 English to German translation dataset and a maximum improvement of 1.99 BLEU points when trained on a fraction of the dataset. In addition, we find that the incorporation of syntax into BERT fine-tuning outperforms baseline on a number of downstream tasks from the GLUE benchmark."}

Training such models, however, poses an unprecedented demand for computing power, which incurs exponentially increasing energy cost and carbon dioxide emissions. It is thus critical to develop efficient training solutions to reduce the training costs. Motivated by a set of key observations of inter- and intra-layer similarities among feature maps and attentions that can be identified from typical training processes, we propose a multi-level framework for training acceleration. Specifically, the framework is based on three basic operators, Coalescing, De-coalescing and Interpolation, which can be orchestrated to build a multi-level training framework. The framework consists of a V-cycle training process, which progressively down- and up-scales the model size and projects the parameters between adjacent levels of models via coalescing and de-coalescing. The key idea is that a smaller model that can be trained for fast convergence and the trained parameters provides high-qualities intermediate solutions for the next level larger network. The interpolation operator is designed to break the symmetry of neurons incurred by de-coalescing for better convergence performance. Our experiments on transformer-based language models (e.g. Bert, GPT) as well as a vision model (e.g. DeiT) prove that the proposed framework reduces the computational cost by about 20% on training BERT/GPT-Base models and up to 51.6% on training the BERT-Large model while preserving the performance."}

Existing works often utilize fine-tuning or resort to extra attribute classifiers, yet suffer from storage and inference time increases. To address these concerns, we explore attribute-based CTG in a prompt-based manner. In short, the proposed Tailor represents each attribute as a pre-trained continuous vector (i.e., single-attribute prompt) and guides the generation of a fixed PLM switch to a pre-specified attribute. We experimentally find that these prompts can be simply concatenated as a whole to multi-attribute CTG without any re-training, yet raises problems of fluency decrease and position sensitivity. To this end, Tailor provides a multi-attribute prompt mask and a re-indexing position-ids sequence to bridge the gap between the training (one prompt for each task) and testing stage (concatenating more than one prompt). To further enhance such single-attribute prompt combinations, Tailor also introduces a trainable prompt connector, which can be concatenated with any two single-attribute prompts to multi-attribute text generation. Experiments on 11 attribute-specific generation tasks demonstrate strong performances of Tailor on both single-attribute and multi-attribute CTG, with 0.08\\% training parameters of a GPT-2."}

They have been shown to provide high performances on a variety of tasks but are also prone to shortcut learning and bias. Addressing such incorrect model behavior via parameter adjustments is very costly. This is particularly problematic for updating dynamic concepts, such as moral values, which vary culturally or interpersonally. In this work, we question the current common practice of storing all information in the model parameters and propose the Revision Transformer (RiT) to facilitate easy model updating. The specific combination of a large-scale pre-trained LM that inherently but also diffusely encodes world knowledge with a clear-structured revision engine makes it possible to update the model's knowledge with little effort and the help of user interaction. We exemplify RiT on a moral dataset and simulate user feedback demonstrating strong performance in model revision even with small data. This way, users can easily design a model regarding their preferences, paving the way for more transparent AI models."}

We further propose two-level granularity feature representations and sequence-level training to improve the Transformer-based unified framework. Experiments show that our approach significantly improves previous Transformer-based model X-LXMERT's FID from 37.0 to 29.9 (lower is better) for text-to-image generation, and improves CIDEr-D score from 100.9% to 122.6% for fine-tuned image-to-text generation on the MS-COCO dataset.

In this paper, we introduce CEV-LM - a lightweight, semi-autoregressive language model that utilizes constrained edit vectors to control three complementary metrics (speed, volume, and circuitousness) that quantify the shape of text (e.g., pacing of content). We study an extensive set of state-of-the-art CTG models and find that CEV-LM provides significantly more targeted and precise control of these three metrics while preserving semantic content, using less training data, and containing fewer parameters."}

We show that smooth mechanisms result in high quality outcome in equilibrium both in the full information setting and in the Bayesian setting with uncertainty about participants, as well as in learning outcomes. Our main result is to show that such mechanisms compose well: smoothness locally at each mechanism implies efficiency globally. For mechanisms where good performance requires that bidders do not bid above their value, we identify the notion of a weakly smooth mechanism. Weakly smooth mechanisms, such as the Vickrey auction, are approximately efficient under the no-overbidding assumption. Similar to smooth mechanisms, weakly smooth mechanisms behave well in composition, and have high quality outcome in equilibrium (assuming no overbidding) both in the full information setting and in the Bayesian setting, as well as in learning outcomes. In most of the paper we assume participants have quasi-linear valuations. We also extend some of our results to settings where participants have budget constraints."}

Although sparse attention can be used to improve computational efficiency, as suggested in existing work, it has limited modeling capacity and often fails to capture complicated dependencies in long sequences. To tackle this challenge, we propose MASFormer, an easy-to-implement transformer variant with Mixed Attention Spans. Specifically, MASFormer is equipped with full attention to capture long-range dependencies, but only at a small number of layers. For the remaining layers, MASformer only employs sparse attention to capture short-range dependencies. Our experiments on natural language modeling and generation tasks show that a decoder-only MASFormer model of 1.3B parameters can achieve competitive performance to vanilla transformers with full attention while significantly reducing computational cost (up to 75%). Additionally, we investigate the effectiveness of continual training with long sequence data and how sequence length impacts downstream generation performance, which may be of independent interest."}

However, the unsupervised pre-training step of these models suffers from unbearable overall computational expenses. Current methods for accelerating the pre-training either rely on massive parallelism with advanced hardware or are not applicable to language modeling. In this work, we propose a method based on progressive layer dropping that speeds the training of Transformer-based language models, not at the cost of excessive hardware resources but from model architecture change and training technique boosted efficiency. Extensive experiments on BERT show that the proposed method achieves a 24% time reduction on average per sample and allows the pre-training to be 2.5 times faster than the baseline to get a similar accuracy on downstream tasks. While being faster, our pre-trained models are equipped with strong knowledge transferability, achieving comparable and sometimes higher GLUE score than the baseline when pre-trained with the same number of samples."}

Evaluating linguistic novelty in text generation using RAVEN", "abstract": "Current language models can generate high-quality text. Are they simply copying text they have seen before, or have they learned generalizable linguistic abstractions? To tease apart these possibilities, we introduce RAVEN, a suite of analyses for assessing the novelty of generated text, focusing on sequential structure (n-grams) and syntactic structure. We apply these analyses to four neural language models (an LSTM, a Transformer, Transformer-XL, and GPT-2). For local structure - e.g., individual dependencies - model-generated text is substantially less novel than our baseline of human-generated text from each model's test set. For larger-scale structure - e.g., overall sentence structure - model-generated text is as novel or even more novel than the human-generated baseline, but models still sometimes copy substantially, in some cases duplicating passages over 1,000 words long from the training set. We also perform extensive manual analysis showing that GPT-2's novel text is usually well-formed morphologically and syntactically but has reasonably frequent semantic issues (e.g., being self-contradictory)."}

We propose a new grounded keys-to-text generation task: the task is to generate a factual description about an entity given a set of guiding keys, and grounding passages. To address this task, we introduce a new dataset, called EntDeGen. Inspired by recent QA-based evaluation measures, we propose an automatic metric, MAFE, for factual correctness of generated descriptions. Our EntDescriptor model is equipped with strong rankers to fetch helpful passages and generate entity descriptions. Experimental result shows a good correlation (60.14) between our proposed metric and human judgments of factuality. Our rankers significantly improved the factual correctness of generated descriptions (15.95% and 34.51% relative gains in recall and precision).

To improve efficiency while maintaining a high accuracy, we propose a new architecture, DoT, a double transformer model, that decomposes the problem into two sub-tasks: A shallow pruning transformer that selects the top-K tokens, followed by a deep task-specific transformer that takes as input those K tokens. Additionally, we modify the task-specific attention to incorporate the pruning scores. The two transformers are jointly trained by optimizing the task-specific loss. We run experiments on three benchmarks, including entailment and question-answering. We show that for a small drop of accuracy, DoT improves training and inference time by at least 50%. We also show that the pruning transformer effectively selects relevant tokens enabling the end-to-end model to maintain similar accuracy as slower baseline models. Finally, we analyse the pruning and give some insight into its impact on the task model."}

Early deep learning models were constrained by their sequential or unidirectional nature, such that they struggled to capture the contextual relationships across text inputs. The introduction of bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) leads to a robust encoder for the transformer model that can understand the broader context and deliver state-of-the-art performance across various NLP tasks. This has inspired researchers and practitioners to apply BERT to practical problems, such as information retrieval (IR). A survey that focuses on a comprehensive analysis of prevalent approaches that apply pretrained transformer encoders like BERT to IR can thus be useful for academia and the industry. In light of this, we revisit a variety of BERT-based methods in this survey, cover a wide range of techniques of IR, and group them into six high-level categories: (i) handling long documents, (ii) integrating semantic information, (iii) balancing effectiveness and efficiency, (iv) predicting the weights of terms, (v) query expansion, and (vi) document expansion. We also provide links to resources, including datasets and toolkits, for BERT-based IR systems. A key highlight of our survey is the comparison between BERT's encoder-based models and the latest generative Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, which rely on decoders. Despite the popularity of LLMs, we find that for specific tasks, finely tuned BERT encoders still outperform, and at a lower deployment cost. Finally, we summarize the comprehensive outcomes of the survey and suggest directions for future research in the area."}

We investigate the performance and sensitivity of transferred neural architectures from pre-trained GPT-2 and BERT models. We test the fine-tuning performance based on freezing transformer layers, batch size, and learning rate. We find the parameters of BERT are hypersensitive to stochasticity in fine-tuning and that GPT-2 is more stable in such practice. It is also clear that the earlier layers of GPT-2 and BERT contain essential word pattern information that should be maintained."}

This paper comes to address this gap by presenting an empirical analysis of scalability and performance of inferencing a Transformer-based model on CPUs. Focusing on the highly popular BERT model, we identify key components of the Transformer architecture where the bulk of the computation happens, and propose three optimizations to speed them up. The optimizations are evaluated using the inference benchmark from HuggingFace, and are shown to achieve the speedup of up to x2.37.

A significant disruption at the intersection of ML and text are text-generating large-language models such as generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs). We empirically assess the differences in how ML-based scoring models trained on human content assess the quality of content generated by humans versus GPTs. To do so, we propose an analysis framework that encompasses essay scoring ML-models, human and ML-generated essays, and a statistical model that parsimoniously considers the impact of type of respondent, prompt genre, and the ML model used for assessment model. A rich testbed is utilized that encompasses 18,460 human-generated and GPT-based essays. Results of our benchmark analysis reveal that transformer pretrained language models (PLMs) more accurately score human essay quality as compared to CNN/RNN and feature-based ML methods. Interestingly, we find that the transformer PLMs tend to score GPT-generated text 10-15\\% higher on average, relative to human-authored documents. Conversely, traditional deep learning and feature-based ML models score human text considerably higher. Further analysis reveals that although the transformer PLMs are exclusively fine-tuned on human text, they more prominently attend to certain tokens appearing only in GPT-generated text, possibly due to familiarity/overlap in pre-training. Our framework and results have implications for text classification settings where automated scoring of text is likely to be disrupted by generative AI."}

This intensifies the need to ensure that models are aligned with human preferences and do not produce unsafe, inaccurate or toxic outputs. While alignment techniques like reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) and red-teaming can mitigate some safety concerns and improve model capabilities, it is unlikely that an aggregate fine-tuning process can adequately represent the full range of users' preferences and values. Different people may legitimately disagree on their preferences for language and conversational norms, as well as on values or ideologies which guide their communication. Personalising LLMs through micro-level preference learning processes may result in models that are better aligned with each user. However, there are several normative challenges in defining the bounds of a societally-acceptable and safe degree of personalisation. In this paper, we ask how, and in what ways, LLMs should be personalised. First, we review literature on current paradigms for aligning LLMs with human feedback, and identify issues including (i) a lack of clarity regarding what alignment means; (ii) a tendency of technology providers to prescribe definitions of inherently subjective preferences and values; and (iii) a 'tyranny of the crowdworker', exacerbated by a lack of documentation in who we are really aligning to. Second, we present a taxonomy of benefits and risks associated with personalised LLMs, for individuals and society at large. Finally, we propose a three-tiered policy framework that allows users to experience the benefits of personalised alignment, while restraining unsafe and undesirable LLM-behaviours within (supra-)national and organisational bounds."}

However, when it comes to financial time series prediction, LSTM is still a dominant architecture. Therefore, the question this study wants to answer is: whether the Transformer-based model can be applied in financial time series prediction and beat LSTM. To answer this question, various LSTM-based and Transformer-based models are compared on multiple financial prediction tasks based on high-frequency limit order book data. A new LSTM-based model called DLSTM is built and new architecture for the Transformer-based model is designed to adapt for financial prediction.

This structure is linked to the notion of independent mechanisms from the causality literature, in which a mechanism is able to retain the same processing as irrelevant aspects of the world are changed. For example, convnets enable separation over positions, while attention-based architectures (especially Transformers) learn which combination of positions to process dynamically. In this work we explore a way in which the Transformer architecture is deficient: it represents each position with a large monolithic hidden representation and a single set of parameters which are applied over the entire hidden representation. This potentially throws unrelated sources of information together, and limits the Transformer's ability to capture independent mechanisms. To address this, we propose Transformers with Independent Mechanisms (TIM), a new Transformer layer which divides the hidden representation and parameters into multiple mechanisms, which only exchange information through attention. Additionally, we propose a competition mechanism which encourages these mechanisms to specialize over time steps, and thus be more independent. We study TIM on a large-scale BERT model, on the Image Transformer, and on speech enhancement and find evidence for semantically meaningful specialization as well as improved performance."}

In order to improve the relevance of generated results, conditional text generators were developed that use input keywords or attributes to produce the corresponding text. Prior work, however, do not finely control the diversity of automatically generated sentences. For example, it does not control the order of keywords to put more relevant ones first. Moreover, it does not explicitly control the balance between diversity and accuracy. To remedy these problems, we propose a fine-grained controllable generative model, called~\\textit{Apex}, that uses an algorithm borrowed from automatic control (namely, a variant of the \\textit{proportional, integral, and derivative (PID) controller}) to precisely manipulate the diversity/accuracy trade-off of generated text. The algorithm is injected into a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), allowing \\textit{Apex} to control both (i) the order of keywords in the generated sentences (conditioned on the input keywords and their order), and (ii) the trade-off between diversity and accuracy. Evaluation results on real-world datasets show that the proposed method outperforms existing generative models in terms of diversity and relevance. Apex is currently deployed to generate production descriptions and item recommendation reasons in Taobao owned by Alibaba, the largest E-commerce platform in China. The A/B production test results show that our method improves click-through rate (CTR) by 13.17\\% compared to the existing method for production descriptions.

Although it leads to a better and more accurate prediction, the resulting model becomes even more costly, as it requires weeks of training with a huge amount of GPU resources. Particularly, the size and computational cost of transformer-based models have increased tremendously since its first debut in 2017 from ~100 million parameters up to ~1.6 trillion parameters in early 2021. This computationally hungry model also incurs a substantial cost to the environment and even reaches an alarming level of carbon footprint. Some of these models are so massive that it is even impossible to run the model without a GPU cluster. Greenformers improve the model efficiency of transformer models by applying low-rank approximation approaches. Specifically, we propose a low-rank factorization approach to improve the efficiency of the transformer model called Low-Rank Transformer. We further compare our model with an existing low-rank factorization approach called Linformer. Based on our analysis, the Low-Rank Transformer model is suitable for improving both the time and memory efficiency in processing short-sequence (<= 512) input data, while the Linformer model is suitable for improving the efficiency in processing long-sequence input data (>= 512). We also show that Low-Rank Transformer is more suitable for on-device deployment, as it significantly reduces the model size. Additionally, we estimate that applying LRT to the existing BERT-base model can significantly reduce the computational, economical, and environmental costs for developing such models by more than 30% of its original costs."}

They have achieved great popularity in deep learning applications, but the increasing sizes of the parameter spaces required by transformer models generate a commensurate need to accelerate performance. Natural language processing problems are also routinely faced with variable-length sequences, as word counts commonly vary among sentences. Existing deep learning frameworks pad variable-length sequences to a maximal length, which adds significant memory and computational overhead. In this paper, we present ByteTransformer, a high-performance transformer boosted for variable-length inputs. We propose a padding-free algorithm that liberates the entire transformer from redundant computations on zero padded tokens. In addition to algorithmic-level optimization, we provide architecture-aware optimizations for transformer functional modules, especially the performance-critical algorithm Multi-Head Attention (MHA). Experimental results on an NVIDIA A100 GPU with variable-length sequence inputs validate that our fused MHA outperforms PyTorch by 6.13x. The end-to-end performance of ByteTransformer for a forward BERT transformer surpasses state-of-the-art transformer frameworks, such as PyTorch JIT, TensorFlow XLA, Tencent TurboTransformer, Microsoft DeepSpeed-Inference and NVIDIA FasterTransformer, by 87\\%, 131\\%, 138\\%, 74\\% and 55\\%, respectively. We also demonstrate the general applicability of our optimization methods to other BERT-like models, including ALBERT, DistilBERT, and DeBERTa."}

Among transformer models, Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) has achieved remarkable performance in text generation, or natural language generation (NLG), which needs the processing of a large input context in the summarization stage, followed by the generation stage that produces a single word at a time. The conventional platforms such as GPU are specialized for the parallel processing of large inputs in the summarization stage, but their performance significantly degrades in the generation stage due to its sequential characteristic. Therefore, an efficient hardware platform is required to address the high latency caused by the sequential characteristic of text generation. In this paper, we present DFX, a multi-FPGA acceleration appliance that executes GPT-2 model inference end-to-end with low latency and high throughput in both summarization and generation stages. DFX uses model parallelism and optimized dataflow that is model-and-hardware-aware for fast simultaneous workload execution among devices. Its compute cores operate on custom instructions and provide GPT-2 operations end-to-end. We implement the proposed hardware architecture on four Xilinx Alveo U280 FPGAs and utilize all of the channels of the high bandwidth memory (HBM) and the maximum number of compute resources for high hardware efficiency. DFX achieves 5.58x speedup and 3.99x energy efficiency over four NVIDIA V100 GPUs on the modern GPT-2 model. DFX is also 8.21x more cost-effective than the GPU appliance, suggesting that it is a promising solution for text generation workloads in cloud datacenters."}

Among them are low-rank projection methods such as Linformer and kernel-based Transformers. Despite their unique merits, they usually suffer from a performance drop comparing with the vanilla transformer on many sequence generation tasks, and often fail to obtain computation gain when the generation is short. We propose MemSizer, an approach towards closing the performance gap while improving the efficiency even with short generation. It projects the source sequences into lower dimension representations like Linformer, while enjoying efficient recurrent-style incremental computation similar to kernel-based transformers. This yields linear computation time and constant memory complexity at inference time. MemSizer also employs a lightweight multi-head mechanism which renders the computation as light as a single-head model. We demonstrate that MemSizer provides an improved balance between efficiency and accuracy over the vanilla transformer and other efficient transformer variants in three typical sequence generation tasks, including machine translation, abstractive text summarization, and language modeling."}

However, it has difficulty in handling long documents due to the quadratic complexity with input text length. In order to handle this problem, we propose a hierarchical interactive Transformer (Hi-Transformer) for efficient and effective long document modeling. Hi-Transformer models documents in a hierarchical way, i.e., first learns sentence representations and then learns document representations. It can effectively reduce the complexity and meanwhile capture global document context in the modeling of each sentence. More specifically, we first use a sentence Transformer to learn the representations of each sentence. Then we use a document Transformer to model the global document context from these sentence representations. Next, we use another sentence Transformer to enhance sentence modeling using the global document context. Finally, we use hierarchical pooling method to obtain document embedding. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the efficiency and effectiveness of Hi-Transformer in long document modeling."}

In this work, we introduce a Transformer variant, named Magneto, to fulfill the goal. Specifically, we propose Sub-LayerNorm for good expressivity, and the initialization strategy theoretically derived from DeepNet for stable scaling up. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior performance and better stability than the de facto Transformer variants designed for various applications, including language modeling (i.e., BERT, and GPT), machine translation, vision pretraining (i.e., BEiT), speech recognition, and multimodal pretraining (i.e., BEiT-3)."}

This has many implications, for example, as AI-generated text becomes a significant fraction of the text, would this have an effect on the language capabilities of readers and also on the training of newer AI tools? Would it affect the evolution of languages? Focusing on one specific aspect of the language: words; will the use of tools such as ChatGPT increase or reduce the vocabulary used or the lexical richness? This has implications for words, as those not included in AI-generated content will tend to be less and less popular and may eventually be lost. In this work, we perform an initial comparison of the vocabulary and lexical richness of ChatGPT and humans when performing the same tasks. In more detail, two datasets containing the answers to different types of questions answered by ChatGPT and humans, and a third dataset in which ChatGPT paraphrases sentences and questions are used. The analysis shows that ChatGPT tends to use fewer distinct words and lower lexical richness than humans. These results are very preliminary and additional datasets and ChatGPT configurations have to be evaluated to extract more general conclusions. Therefore, further research is needed to understand how the use of ChatGPT and more broadly generative AI tools will affect the vocabulary and lexical richness in different types of text and languages."}

Current evaluations of these procedures focus on benchmarks of instruction following, reasoning, and truthfulness. However, human preferences are not universal, and aligning to specific preference sets may have unintended effects. We explore how alignment impacts performance along three axes of global representation: English dialects, multilingualism, and opinions from and about countries worldwide. Our results show that current alignment procedures create disparities between English dialects and global opinions. We find alignment improves capabilities in several languages. We conclude by discussing design decisions that led to these unintended impacts and recommendations for more equitable preference tuning. We make our code and data publicly available on Github."}

In the context of narrative generation, however, existing models still do not capture factors that contribute to producing consistent text. For instance, it is logical that a piece of text or a story should be uniformly readable throughout and that this form of complexity should be controllable. As such, if the complexity of an input text prompt is rated first-grade reading level in the Flesch Reading Ease test, then the generated text continuing the plot should also be within this range of complexity. With this in mind, we introduce Uniform Complexity for Text Generation (UCTG), a new benchmark test which raises the challenge of making generative models observe uniform linguistic properties with respect to prompts. We experiment with over 150+ linguistically and cognitively motivated features for evaluating text complexity in humans and generative models. From our results, we find that models such as GPT-2 struggle to preserve the complexity of input prompts used in its generations, even if finetuned with professionally written texts."}

Aligning Language Models with Judgments", "abstract": "As humans, we consistently interact with our peers and receive feedback in the form of natural language. This language feedback allows us to maintain appropriate behavior, and rectify potential errors. The question arises naturally: can we use language feedback to align large language models (LLMs)? In contrast to previous research that aligns LLMs with scalar rewards, we present the first systematic exploration of alignment through the lens of language feedback (i.e., judgment). We start with an in-depth investigation of potential methods that can be adapted for aligning LLMs with judgments, revealing that these methods cannot fully capitalize on judgments. To facilitate more effective utilization of judgments, we propose a novel framework, Contrastive Unlikelihood Training (CUT), that allows for fine-grained inappropriate content detection and correction based on judgments. Our results show that, with merely 1317 off-the-shelf judgment data, CUT (LLaMA2-13b) can beat the 175B DaVinci003 and surpass the best baseline by 50.84 points on AlpacaEval. CUT (LLaMA2-chat-13b) can also align LLMs in an iterative fashion using up-to-date model-specific judgments, improving performance from 81.09 to 91.68 points on AlpacaEval. Further analysis suggests that judgments hold greater potential than rewards in LLM alignment."}

The relationship between the goal (metrics) of target content and the content itself is non-trivial. While large-scale language models show promising text generation capabilities, guiding the generated text with external metrics is challenging. These metrics and content tend to have inherent relationships and not all of them may be of consequence. We introduce CaM-Gen: Causally aware Generative Networks guided by user-defined target metrics incorporating the causal relationships between the metric and content features. We leverage causal inference techniques to identify causally significant aspects of a text that lead to the target metric and then explicitly guide generative models towards these by a feedback mechanism. We propose this mechanism for variational autoencoder and Transformer-based generative models. The proposed models beat baselines in terms of the target metric control while maintaining fluency and language quality of the generated text. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the early attempts at controlled generation incorporating a metric guide using causal inference."}

These models have no explicit linguistic structure built into them, yet they may still implicitly learn structured relationships by attending to relevant tokens. We hypothesize that this structural learning could be made more robust by explicitly endowing Transformers with a structural bias, and we investigate two methods for building in such a bias. One method, the TP-Transformer, augments the traditional Transformer architecture to include an additional component to represent structure. The second method imbues structure at the data level by segmenting the data with morphological tokenization. We test these methods on translating from English into morphologically rich languages, Turkish and Inuktitut, and consider both automatic metrics and human evaluations. We find that each of these two approaches allows the network to achieve better performance, but this improvement is dependent on the size of the dataset. In sum, structural encoding methods make Transformers more sample-efficient, enabling them to perform better from smaller amounts of data."}
{"id": "136", "arxiv": "2205.01749v2", "title": "Mixed-effects transformers for hierarchical adaptation", "abstract": "Language use differs dramatically from context to context. To some degree, modern language models like GPT-3 are able to account for such variance by conditioning on a string of previous input text, or prompt. Yet prompting is ineffective when contexts are sparse, out-of-sample, or extra-textual; for instance, accounting for when and where the text was produced or who produced it. In this paper, we introduce the mixed-effects transformer (MET), a novel approach for learning hierarchically-structured prefixes -- lightweight modules prepended to the input -- to account for structured variation. Specifically, we show how the popular class of mixed-effects models may be extended to transformer-based architectures using a regularized prefix-tuning procedure with dropout. We evaluate this approach on several domain-adaptation benchmarks, finding that it efficiently adapts to novel contexts with minimal data while still effectively generalizing to unseen contexts."}

However, vanilla prompt tuning tends to imitate training corpus characteristics beyond the control attributes, resulting in a poor generalization ability. Moreover, it is less able to capture the relationship between different attributes, further limiting the control performance. In this paper, we propose a new CTG approach, namely DisCup, which incorporates the attribute knowledge of discriminator to optimize the control-prompts, steering a frozen CLM to produce attribute-specific texts. Specifically, the frozen CLM model, capable of producing multitudinous texts, is first used to generate the next-token candidates based on the context, so as to ensure the diversity of tokens to be predicted. Then, we leverage an attribute-discriminator to select desired/undesired tokens from those candidates, providing the inter-attribute knowledge. Finally, we bridge the above two traits by an unlikelihood objective for prompt-tuning. Extensive experimental results show that DisCup can achieve a new state-of-the-art control performance while maintaining an efficient and high-quality text generation, only relying on around 10 virtual tokens."}

In this paper, we propose an unsupervised reference-free metric called CTRLEval, which evaluates controlled text generation from different aspects by formulating each aspect into multiple text infilling tasks. On top of these tasks, the metric assembles the generation probabilities from a pre-trained language model without any model training. Experimental results show that our metric has higher correlations with human judgments than other baselines, while obtaining better generalization of evaluating generated texts from different models and with different qualities."}

Existing methods for achieving this alignment often involves employing reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to fine-tune LLMs based on human labels assessing the relative quality of model responses. Nevertheless, RLHF is susceptible to instability during fine-tuning and presents challenges in implementation.Drawing inspiration from the emerging field of representation engineering (RepE), this study aims to identify relevant representations for high-level human preferences embedded in patterns of activity within an LLM, and achieve precise control of model behavior by transforming its representations. This novel approach, denoted as Representation Alignment from Human Feedback (RAHF), proves to be effective, computationally efficient, and easy to implement.Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of RAHF in not only capturing but also manipulating representations to align with a broad spectrum of human preferences or values, rather than being confined to a singular concept or function (e.g. honesty or bias). RAHF's versatility in accommodating diverse human preferences shows its potential for advancing LLM performance."}

However, these approaches often require significant architectural or decoding modifications, making them challenging to apply to additional constraints or resolve different constraint combinations. To address this, our paper introduces Regular Expression Instruction (REI), which utilizes an instruction-based mechanism to fully exploit regular expressions' advantages to uniformly model diverse constraints. Specifically, our REI supports all popular fine-grained controllable generation constraints, i.e., lexical, positional, and length, as well as their complex combinations, via regular expression-style instructions. Our method only requires fine-tuning on medium-scale language models or few-shot, in-context learning on large language models, and requires no further adjustment when applied to various constraint combinations. Experiments demonstrate that our straightforward approach yields high success rates and adaptability to various constraints while maintaining competitiveness in automatic metrics and outperforming most previous baselines."}

In this paper, we present an initial exploration of language model optimization for human preferences from direct outcome datasets, where each sample consists of a text and an associated numerical outcome measuring the reader's response. We first propose that language model optimization should be viewed as a causal problem to ensure that the model correctly learns the relationship between the text and the outcome. We formalize this causal language optimization problem, and we develop a method--causal preference optimization (CPO)--that solves an unbiased surrogate objective for the problem. We further extend CPO with doubly robust CPO (DR-CPO), which reduces the variance of the surrogate objective while retaining provably strong guarantees on bias. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of (DR-)CPO in optimizing state-of-the-art LLMs for human preferences on direct outcome data, and we validate the robustness of DR-CPO under difficult confounding conditions."}

However, because energy-based LMs are globally normalized, approximate techniques like Metropolis-Hastings (MH) are required for inference. Past work has largely explored simple proposal distributions that modify a single token at a time, like in Gibbs sampling. In this paper, we develop a novel MH sampler that, in contrast, proposes re-writes of the entire sequence in each step via iterative prompting of a large language model. Our new sampler (a) allows for more efficient and accurate sampling from a target distribution and (b) allows generation length to be determined through the sampling procedure rather than fixed in advance, as past work has required. We perform experiments on two controlled generation tasks, showing both downstream performance gains and more accurate target distribution sampling in comparison with single-token proposal techniques."}
{"id": "143", "arxiv": "2208.06162v1", "title": "Layout-Bridging Text-to-Image Synthesis", "abstract": "The crux of text-to-image synthesis stems from the difficulty of preserving the cross-modality semantic consistency between the input text and the synthesized image. Typical methods, which seek to model the text-to-image mapping directly, could only capture keywords in the text that indicates common objects or actions but fail to learn their spatial distribution patterns. An effective way to circumvent this limitation is to generate an image layout as guidance, which is attempted by a few methods. Nevertheless, these methods fail to generate practically effective layouts due to the diversity of input text and object location. In this paper we push for effective modeling in both text-to-layout generation and layout-to-image synthesis. Specifically, we formulate the text-to-layout generation as a sequence-to-sequence modeling task, and build our model upon Transformer to learn the spatial relationships between objects by modeling the sequential dependencies between them. In the stage of layout-to-image synthesis, we focus on learning the textual-visual semantic alignment per object in the layout to precisely incorporate the input text into the layout-to-image synthesizing process. To evaluate the quality of generated layout, we design a new metric specifically, dubbed Layout Quality Score, which considers both the absolute distribution errors of bounding boxes in the layout and the mutual spatial relationships between them. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method over state-of-the-art methods on both predicting the layout and synthesizing the image from the given text."}
