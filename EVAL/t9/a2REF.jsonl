It is regarded as crucial for the development of advanced text generation technologies that better meet the specific constraints in practical applications. In recent years, methods using large-scale pre-trained language models (PLMs), in particular the widely used transformer-based PLMs, have become a new paradigm of NLG, allowing generation of more diverse and fluent text. However, due to the limited level of interpretability of deep neural networks, the controllability of these methods need to be guaranteed. To this end, controllable text generation using transformer-based PLMs has become a rapidly growing yet challenging new research hotspot. A diverse range of approaches have emerged in the recent 3-4 years, targeting different CTG tasks that require different types of controlled constraints. In this paper, we present a systematic critical review on the common tasks, main approaches, and evaluation methods in this area. Finally, we discuss the challenges that the field is facing, and put forward various promising future directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey paper to summarize the state-of-the-art CTG techniques from the perspective of Transformer-based PLMs. We hope it can help researchers and practitioners in the related fields to quickly track the academic and technological frontier, providing them with a landscape of the area and a roadmap for future research."}

Existing works often utilize fine-tuning or resort to extra attribute classifiers, yet suffer from storage and inference time increases. To address these concerns, we explore attribute-based CTG in a prompt-based manner. In short, the proposed Tailor represents each attribute as a pre-trained continuous vector (i.e., single-attribute prompt) and guides the generation of a fixed PLM switch to a pre-specified attribute. We experimentally find that these prompts can be simply concatenated as a whole to multi-attribute CTG without any re-training, yet raises problems of fluency decrease and position sensitivity. To this end, Tailor provides a multi-attribute prompt mask and a re-indexing position-ids sequence to bridge the gap between the training (one prompt for each task) and testing stage (concatenating more than one prompt). To further enhance such single-attribute prompt combinations, Tailor also introduces a trainable prompt connector, which can be concatenated with any two single-attribute prompts to multi-attribute text generation. Experiments on 11 attribute-specific generation tasks demonstrate strong performances of Tailor on both single-attribute and multi-attribute CTG, with 0.08\\% training parameters of a GPT-2."}

In this paper, we propose a controllable dialogue generation model to steer response generation under multi-attribute constraints. Specifically, we define and categorize the commonly used control attributes into global and local ones, which possess different granularities of effects on response generation. Then, we significantly extend the conventional seq2seq framework by introducing a novel two-stage decoder, which first uses a multi-grained style specification layer to impose the stylistic constraints and determine word-level control states of responses based on the attributes, and then employs a response generation layer to generate final responses maintaining both semantic relevancy to the contexts and fidelity to the attributes. Furthermore, we train our model with an attribute consistency reward to promote response control with explicit supervision signals. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses on two datasets indicate that our model can significantly outperform competitive baselines in terms of response quality, content diversity and controllability."}

This advancement has resulted in more fluent, coherent and even properties controllable (e.g. stylistic, sentiment, length etc.) generation, naturally leading to development in downstream tasks such as abstractive summarization, dialogue generation, machine translation, and data-to-text generation. However, the faithfulness problem that the generated text usually contains unfaithful or non-factual information has become the biggest challenge, which makes the performance of text generation unsatisfactory for practical applications in many real-world scenarios. Many studies on analysis, evaluation, and optimization methods for faithfulness problems have been proposed for various tasks, but have not been organized, compared and discussed in a combined manner. In this survey, we provide a systematic overview of the research progress on the faithfulness problem of NLG, including problem analysis, evaluation metrics and optimization methods. We organize the evaluation and optimization methods for different tasks into a unified taxonomy to facilitate comparison and learning across tasks. Several research trends are discussed further."}

Specifically, high quality and diverse question generation can dramatically reduce the load on teachers and improve the quality of their educational content. Recent work in this domain has made progress with generation, but fails to show that real teachers judge the generated questions as sufficiently useful for the classroom setting; or if instead the questions have errors and/or pedagogically unhelpful content.

DATG modulates the occurrence of key attribute words and key anti-attribute words, achieving effective attribute control without compromising the original capabilities of the model. We conduct experiments across four datasets in two tasks: toxicity mitigation and sentiment transformation, employing five LLMs as foundational models.

However, vanilla prompt tuning tends to imitate training corpus characteristics beyond the control attributes, resulting in a poor generalization ability. Moreover, it is less able to capture the relationship between different attributes, further limiting the control performance. In this paper, we propose a new CTG approach, namely DisCup, which incorporates the attribute knowledge of discriminator to optimize the control-prompts, steering a frozen CLM to produce attribute-specific texts. Specifically, the frozen CLM model, capable of producing multitudinous texts, is first used to generate the next-token candidates based on the context, so as to ensure the diversity of tokens to be predicted. Then, we leverage an attribute-discriminator to select desired/undesired tokens from those candidates, providing the inter-attribute knowledge. Finally, we bridge the above two traits by an unlikelihood objective for prompt-tuning. Extensive experimental results show that DisCup can achieve a new state-of-the-art control performance while maintaining an efficient and high-quality text generation, only relying on around 10 virtual tokens."}

Furthermore, our expert-based human evaluations demonstrate that the small-sized pre-trained language model (PLM) won over the other two extra-large language models by a large margin, in the clinical domain fine-tuning, which finding was never reported in the field. Finally, the transfer learning method works well in our experimental setting using the WMT21fb model to accommodate a new language space Spanish that was not seen at the pre-training stage within WMT21fb itself, which deserves more exploitation for clinical knowledge transformation, e.g. to investigate into more languages.

Problem list summarization requires a model to understand, abstract, and generate clinical documentation. In this work, we propose a new NLP task that aims to generate a list of problems in a patient's daily care plan using input from the provider's progress notes during hospitalization. We investigate the performance of T5 and BART, two state-of-the-art seq2seq transformer architectures, in solving this problem. We provide a corpus built on top of progress notes from publicly available electronic health record progress notes in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III. T5 and BART are trained on general domain text, and we experiment with a data augmentation method and a domain adaptation pre-training method to increase exposure to medical vocabulary and knowledge. Evaluation methods include ROUGE, BERTScore, cosine similarity on sentence embedding, and F-score on medical concepts. Results show that T5 with domain adaptive pre-training achieves significant performance gains compared to a rule-based system and general domain pre-trained language models, indicating a promising direction for tackling the problem summarization task."}

Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in natural language processing (NLP), their effectiveness on a diverse range of clinical summarization tasks remains unproven. In this study, we apply adaptation methods to eight LLMs, spanning four distinct clinical summarization tasks: radiology reports, patient questions, progress notes, and doctor-patient dialogue. Quantitative assessments with syntactic, semantic, and conceptual NLP metrics reveal trade-offs between models and adaptation methods. A clinical reader study with ten physicians evaluates summary completeness, correctness, and conciseness; in a majority of cases, summaries from our best adapted LLMs are either equivalent (45%) or superior (36%) compared to summaries from medical experts. The ensuing safety analysis highlights challenges faced by both LLMs and medical experts, as we connect errors to potential medical harm and categorize types of fabricated information. Our research provides evidence of LLMs outperforming medical experts in clinical text summarization across multiple tasks. This suggests that integrating LLMs into clinical workflows could alleviate documentation burden, allowing clinicians to focus more on patient care."}

In that process, the application of different machine learning (ML) techniques is crucial. Tasks such as the classification of legal documents or contract clauses as well as the translation of those are highly relevant. On the other side, digitized documents are barely accessible in this field, particularly in Germany. Today, deep learning (DL) is one of the hot topics with many publications and various applications. Sometimes it provides results outperforming the human level. Hence this technique may be feasible for the legal domain as well. However, DL requires thousands of samples to provide decent results. A potential solution to this problem is multi-task DL to enable transfer learning. This approach may be able to overcome the data scarcity problem in the legal domain, specifically for the German language. We applied the state of the art multi-task model on three tasks: translation, summarization, and multi-label classification. The experiments were conducted on legal document corpora utilizing several task combinations as well as various model parameters. The goal was to find the optimal configuration for the tasks at hand within the legal domain. The multi-task DL approach outperformed the state of the art results in all three tasks. This opens a new direction to integrate DL technology more efficiently in the legal domain."}

Considerable progress has been made in automatically summarizing short texts, such as news articles, often leading to satisfactory results. However, summarizing long documents remains a major challenge. This is due to the complex contextual information in the text and the lack of open-source benchmarking datasets and evaluation frameworks that can be used to develop and test model performance. In this work, we use ChatGPT, the latest breakthrough in the field of large language models (LLMs), together with the extractive summarization model C2F-FAR (Coarse-to-Fine Facet-Aware Ranking) to propose a hybrid extraction and summarization pipeline for long documents such as business articles and books. We work with the world-renowned company getAbstract AG and leverage their expertise and experience in professional book summarization. A practical study has shown that machine-generated summaries can perform at least as well as human-written summaries when evaluated using current automated evaluation metrics. However, a closer examination of the texts generated by ChatGPT through human evaluations has shown that there are still critical issues in terms of text coherence, faithfulness, and style. Overall, our results show that the use of ChatGPT is a very promising but not yet mature approach for summarizing long documents and can at best serve as an inspiration for human editors. We anticipate that our work will inform NLP researchers about the extent to which ChatGPT's capabilities for summarizing long documents overlap with practitioners' needs. Further work is needed to test the proposed hybrid summarization pipeline, in particular involving GPT-4, and to propose a new evaluation framework tailored to the task of summarizing long documents."}

High-quality information produced by experts is often filled with difficult jargon laypeople struggle to understand. This is a particularly notable issue in the medical domain, where layman are often confused by medical text online. At present, two bottlenecks interfere with the goal of building high-quality medical expert-layman style transfer systems: a dearth of pretrained medical-domain language models spanning both expert and layman terminologies and a lack of parallel corpora for training the transfer task itself. To mitigate the first issue, we propose a novel language model (LM) pretraining task, Knowledge Base Assimilation, to synthesize pretraining data from the edges of a graph of expert- and layman-style medical terminology terms into an LM during self-supervised learning. To mitigate the second issue, we build a large-scale parallel corpus in the medical expert-layman domain using a margin-based criterion. Our experiments show that transformer-based models pretrained on knowledge base assimilation and other well-established pretraining tasks fine-tuning on our new parallel corpus leads to considerable improvement against expert-layman transfer benchmarks, gaining an average relative improvement of our human evaluation, the Overall Success Rate (OSR), by 106%.

However, the majority of the existing approaches were tested on such domains as online communications on public platforms, music, or entertainment yet none of them were applied to the domains which are typical for task-oriented production systems, such as personal plans arrangements (e.g. booking of flights or reserving a table in a restaurant). We fill this gap by studying formality transfer in this domain. We noted that the texts in this domain are full of named entities, which are very important for keeping the original sense of the text. Indeed, if for example, someone communicates the destination city of a flight it must not be altered. Thus, we concentrate on the role of named entities in content preservation for formality text style transfer. We collect a new dataset for the evaluation of content similarity measures in text style transfer. It is taken from a corpus of task-oriented dialogues and contains many important entities related to realistic requests that make this dataset particularly useful for testing style transfer models before using them in production. Besides, we perform an error analysis of a pre-trained formality transfer model and introduce a simple technique to use information about named entities to enhance the performance of baseline content similarity measures used in text style transfer."}

We (1) build the first CLCTS corpus with 328 instances for hDe-En (extended version with 455 instances) and 289 for hEn-De (extended version with 501 instances), leveraging historical fiction texts and Wikipedia summaries in English and German; (2) examine the effectiveness of popular transformer end-to-end models with different intermediate finetuning tasks; (3) explore the potential of GPT-3.5 as a summarizer; (4) report evaluations from humans, GPT-4, and several recent automatic evaluation metrics. Our results indicate that intermediate task finetuned end-to-end models generate bad to moderate quality summaries while GPT-3.5, as a zero-shot summarizer, provides moderate to good quality outputs. GPT-3.5 also seems very adept at normalizing historical text. To assess data contamination in GPT-3.5, we design an adversarial attack scheme in which we find that GPT-3.5 performs slightly worse for unseen source documents compared to seen documents. Moreover, it sometimes hallucinates when the source sentences are inverted against its prior knowledge with a summarization accuracy of 0.67 for plot omission, 0.71 for entity swap, and 0.53 for plot negation.

People routinely use machine translation software in their daily lives, such as ordering food in a foreign restaurant, receiving medical diagnosis and treatment from foreign doctors, and reading international political news online. However, due to the complexity and intractability of the underlying neural networks, modern machine translation software is still far from robust and can produce poor or incorrect translations; this can lead to misunderstanding, financial loss, threats to personal safety and health, and political conflicts. To address this problem, we introduce referentially transparent inputs (RTIs), a simple, widely applicable methodology for validating machine translation software. A referentially transparent input is a piece of text that should have similar translations when used in different contexts. Our practical implementation, Purity, detects when this property is broken by a translation. To evaluate RTI, we use Purity to test Google Translate and Bing Microsoft Translator with 200 unlabeled sentences, which detected 123 and 142 erroneous translations with high precision (79.3% and 78.3%).

FactPICO consists of 345 plain language summaries of RCT abstracts generated from three LLMs (i.e., GPT-4, Llama-2, and Alpaca), with fine-grained evaluation and natural language rationales from experts. We assess the factuality of critical elements of RCTs in those summaries: Populations, Interventions, Comparators, Outcomes (PICO), as well as the reported findings concerning these. We also evaluate the correctness of the extra information (e.g., explanations) added by LLMs. Using FactPICO, we benchmark a range of existing factuality metrics, including the newly devised ones based on LLMs. We find that plain language summarization of medical evidence is still challenging, especially when balancing between simplicity and factuality, and that existing metrics correlate poorly with expert judgments on the instance level."}

Among transformer models, Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) has achieved remarkable performance in text generation, or natural language generation (NLG), which needs the processing of a large input context in the summarization stage, followed by the generation stage that produces a single word at a time. The conventional platforms such as GPU are specialized for the parallel processing of large inputs in the summarization stage, but their performance significantly degrades in the generation stage due to its sequential characteristic. Therefore, an efficient hardware platform is required to address the high latency caused by the sequential characteristic of text generation.

DFX uses model parallelism and optimized dataflow that is model-and-hardware-aware for fast simultaneous workload execution among devices. Its compute cores operate on custom instructions and provide GPT-2 operations end-to-end. We implement the proposed hardware architecture on four Xilinx Alveo U280 FPGAs and utilize all of the channels of the high bandwidth memory (HBM) and the maximum number of compute resources for high hardware efficiency. DFX achieves 5.58x speedup and 3.99x energy efficiency over four NVIDIA V100 GPUs on the modern GPT-2 model. DFX is also 8.21x more cost-effective than the GPU appliance, suggesting that it is a promising solution for text generation workloads in cloud datacenters."}

However, it is still an open challenge to control the generation process of CLM while balancing flexibility, control granularity, and generation efficiency. In this paper, we provide a new alternative for controllable text generation (CTG), by designing a non-intrusive, lightweight control plugin to accompany the generation of CLM at arbitrary time steps. The proposed control plugin, namely Residual Memory Transformer (RMT), has an encoder-decoder setup, which can accept any types of control conditions and cooperate with CLM through a residual learning paradigm, to achieve a more flexible, general, and efficient CTG. Extensive experiments are carried out on various control tasks, in the form of both automatic and human evaluations. The results show the superiority of RMT over a range of state-of-the-art approaches, proving the effectiveness and versatility of our approach."}

Analyzing Bias in Transformer-Based Language Model Attention Heads", "abstract": "Transformer-based pretrained large language models (PLM) such as BERT and GPT have achieved remarkable success in NLP tasks. However, PLMs are prone to encoding stereotypical biases. Although a burgeoning literature has emerged on stereotypical bias mitigation in PLMs, such as work on debiasing gender and racial stereotyping, how such biases manifest and behave internally within PLMs remains largely unknown. Understanding the internal stereotyping mechanisms may allow better assessment of model fairness and guide the development of effective mitigation strategies. In this work, we focus on attention heads, a major component of the Transformer architecture, and propose a bias analysis framework to explore and identify a small set of biased heads that are found to contribute to a PLM's stereotypical bias. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the existence of these biased heads and to better understand how they behave. We investigate gender and racial bias in the English language in two types of Transformer-based PLMs: the encoder-based BERT model and the decoder-based autoregressive GPT model. Overall, the results shed light on understanding the bias behavior in pretrained language models."}

As a result, a growing community of researchers has been investigating the equity of existing algorithms and proposing novel ones, advancing the understanding of risks and opportunities of automated decision-making for historically disadvantaged populations. Progress in fair Machine Learning hinges on data, which can be appropriately used only if adequately documented. Unfortunately, the algorithmic fairness community suffers from a collective data documentation debt caused by a lack of information on specific resources (opacity) and scatteredness of available information (sparsity). In this work, we target data documentation debt by surveying over two hundred datasets employed in algorithmic fairness research, and producing standardized and searchable documentation for each of them. Moreover we rigorously identify the three most popular fairness datasets, namely Adult, COMPAS and German Credit, for which we compile in-depth documentation. This unifying documentation effort supports multiple contributions. Firstly, we summarize the merits and limitations of Adult, COMPAS and German Credit, adding to and unifying recent scholarship, calling into question their suitability as general-purpose fairness benchmarks. Secondly, we document and summarize hundreds of available alternatives, annotating their domain and supported fairness tasks, along with additional properties of interest for fairness researchers. Finally, we analyze these datasets from the perspective of five important data curation topics: anonymization, consent, inclusivity, sensitive attributes, and transparency. We discuss different approaches and levels of attention to these topics, making them tangible, and distill them into a set of best practices for the curation of novel resources."}

Specifically, it investigates the presence of gender-based biases in LLMs' responses to factual inquiries. This paper takes a multi-pronged approach to evaluating GPT models by evaluating fairness across multiple dimensions of recall, hallucinations and declinations. Our findings reveal discernible gender disparities in the responses generated by GPT-3.5. While advancements in GPT-4 have led to improvements in performance, they have not fully eradicated these gender disparities, notably in instances where responses are declined. The study further explores the origins of these disparities by examining the influence of gender associations in prompts and the homogeneity in the responses."}

A map of the current limitations of the requirements to have fair algorithms", "abstract": "In recent years, the increase in the usage and efficiency of Artificial Intelligence and, more in general, of Automated Decision-Making systems has brought with it an increasing and welcome awareness of the risks associated with such systems. One of such risks is that of perpetuating or even amplifying bias and unjust disparities present in the data from which many of these systems learn to adjust and optimise their decisions. This awareness has on the one hand encouraged several scientific communities to come up with more and more appropriate ways and methods to assess, quantify, and possibly mitigate such biases and disparities. On the other hand, it has prompted more and more layers of society, including policy makers, to call for fair algorithms. We believe that while many excellent and multidisciplinary research is currently being conducted, what is still fundamentally missing is the awareness that having fair algorithms is per se a nearly meaningless requirement that needs to be complemented with many additional social choices to become actionable. Namely, there is a hiatus between what the society is demanding from Automated Decision-Making systems, and what this demand actually means in real-world scenarios. In this work, we outline the key features of such a hiatus and pinpoint a set of crucial open points that we as a society must address in order to give a concrete meaning to the increasing demand of fairness in Automated Decision-Making systems."}

Currently, Large language models (LLMs) that power such chatbots are being utilized primarily for their automation capabilities for software monitoring, report generation etc. and for specific personalized question answering capabilities, on a limited scope and scale. One major limitation of the currently evolving family of LLMs is 'hallucinations', wherein inaccurate responses are reported as factual. Hallucinations are primarily caused by biased training data, ambiguous prompts and inaccurate LLM parameters, and they majorly occur while combining mathematical facts with language-based context. Thus, monitoring and controlling for hallucinations becomes necessary when designing solutions that are meant for decision makers. In this work we present the three major stages in the journey of designing hallucination-minimized LLM-based solutions that are specialized for the decision makers of the financial domain, namely: prototyping, scaling and LLM evolution using human feedback. These three stages and the novel data to answer generation modules presented in this work are necessary to ensure that the Generative AI chatbots, autonomous reports and alerts are reliable and high-quality to aid key decision-making processes."}

Hallucinations are often attributed to knowledge gaps in LMs, but we hypothesize that in some cases, when justifying previously generated hallucinations, LMs output false claims that they can separately recognize as incorrect. We construct three question-answering datasets where ChatGPT and GPT-4 often state an incorrect answer and offer an explanation with at least one incorrect claim. Crucially, we find that ChatGPT and GPT-4 can identify 67% and 87% of their own mistakes, respectively. We refer to this phenomenon as hallucination snowballing: an LM over-commits to early mistakes, leading to more mistakes that it otherwise would not make."}

This issue of hallucination is arguably the biggest hindrance to safely deploying these powerful LLMs into real-world production systems that impact people's lives. The journey toward widespread adoption of LLMs in practical settings heavily relies on addressing and mitigating hallucinations. Unlike traditional AI systems focused on limited tasks, LLMs have been exposed to vast amounts of online text data during training. While this allows them to display impressive language fluency, it also means they are capable of extrapolating information from the biases in training data, misinterpreting ambiguous prompts, or modifying the information to align superficially with the input. This becomes hugely alarming when we rely on language generation capabilities for sensitive applications, such as summarizing medical records, financial analysis reports, etc. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of over 32 techniques developed to mitigate hallucination in LLMs. Notable among these are Retrieval Augmented Generation (Lewis et al, 2021), Knowledge Retrieval (Varshney et al,2023), CoNLI (Lei et al, 2023), and CoVe (Dhuliawala et al, 2023). Furthermore, we introduce a detailed taxonomy categorizing these methods based on various parameters, such as dataset utilization, common tasks, feedback mechanisms, and retriever types. This classification helps distinguish the diverse approaches specifically designed to tackle hallucination issues in LLMs. Additionally, we analyze the challenges and limitations inherent in these techniques, providing a solid foundation for future research in addressing hallucinations and related phenomena within the realm of LLMs."}

However, hallucinations - incorrect or unfounded claims - are still prevalent, prompting the creation of automated metrics to detect these in LLM outputs. Our contributions include: introducing ChainPoll, an innovative hallucination detection method that excels compared to its counterparts, and unveiling RealHall, a refined collection of benchmark datasets to assess hallucination detection metrics from recent studies. While creating RealHall, we assessed tasks and datasets from previous hallucination detection studies and observed that many are not suitable for the potent LLMs currently in use. Overcoming this, we opted for four datasets challenging for modern LLMs and pertinent to real-world scenarios. Using RealHall, we conducted a comprehensive comparison of ChainPoll with numerous hallucination metrics from recent studies. Our findings indicate that ChainPoll outperforms in all RealHall benchmarks, achieving an overall AUROC of 0.781. This surpasses the next best theoretical method by 11% and exceeds industry standards by over 23%. Additionally, ChainPoll is cost-effective and offers greater transparency than other metrics. We introduce two novel metrics to assess LLM hallucinations: Adherence and Correctness. Adherence is relevant to Retrieval Augmented Generation workflows, evaluating an LLM's analytical capabilities within given documents and contexts. In contrast, Correctness identifies logical and reasoning errors."}

The framework is domain-agnostic, allowing the use of any language model for benchmark creation or evaluation in any domain. We introduce the publicly available HypoTermQA Benchmarking Dataset, on which state-of-the-art models' performance ranged between 3% and 11%, and evaluator agents demonstrated a 6% error rate in hallucination prediction. The proposed framework provides opportunities to test and improve LLMs. Additionally, it has the potential to generate benchmarking datasets tailored to specific domains, such as law, health, and finance."}

However, the practical deployment still faces challenges, notably the issue of \"hallucination\", where models generate plausible-sounding but unfaithful or nonsensical information. This issue becomes particularly critical in the medical domain due to the uncommon professional concepts and potential social risks involved. This paper analyses the phenomenon of hallucination in medical generative QA systems using widely adopted LLMs and datasets. Our investigation centers on the identification and comprehension of common problematic answers, with a specific emphasis on hallucination. To tackle this challenge, we present an interactive self-reflection methodology that incorporates knowledge acquisition and answer generation. Through this feedback process, our approach steadily enhances the factuality, consistency, and entailment of the generated answers. Consequently, we harness the interactivity and multitasking ability of LLMs and produce progressively more precise and accurate answers. Experimental results on both automatic and human evaluation demonstrate the superiority of our approach in hallucination reduction compared to baselines."}

Recent research on machine learning and fairness has emphasized that awareness of sensitive attributes, such as race and sex, is critical to the development of interventions. However, on the ground, the existence of these data cannot be taken for granted. This paper uses the domains of employment, credit, and healthcare in the United States to surface conditions that have shaped the availability of sensitive attribute data. For each domain, we describe how and when private companies collect or infer sensitive attribute data for antidiscrimination purposes. An inconsistent story emerges: Some companies are required by law to collect sensitive attribute data, while others are prohibited from doing so. Still others, in the absence of legal mandates, have determined that collection and imputation of these data are appropriate to address disparities. This story has important implications for fairness research and its future applications. If companies that mediate access to life opportunities are unable or hesitant to collect or infer sensitive attribute data, then proposed techniques to detect and mitigate bias in machine learning models might never be implemented outside the lab. We conclude that today's legal requirements and corporate practices, while highly inconsistent across domains, offer lessons for how to approach the collection and inference of sensitive data in appropriate circumstances.

The objective of this paper is to identify the main societal and ethical challenges implied by a massive uptake of AI.

The challenges should be dealt with in different ways depending on their origin; some have technological solutions, while others require ethical, societal, or political answers. Depending on the origin, different stakeholders might need to act. Whatever the identified stakeholder, not treating those issues will lead to uncertainty and unforeseen consequences with potentially large negative societal impact, hurting especially the most vulnerable groups of societies.

Hence, in this paper, we propose an abstractive target-aware related work generator (TAG), which can generate related work sections consisting of new sentences. Concretely, we first propose a target-aware graph encoder, which models the relationships between reference papers and the target paper with target-centered attention mechanisms. In the decoding process, we propose a hierarchical decoder that attends to the nodes of different levels in the graph with keyphrases as semantic indicators. Finally, to generate a more informative related work, we propose multi-level contrastive optimization objectives, which aim to maximize the mutual information between the generated related work with the references and minimize that with non-references.

In the context of visualization, several different types of measures have been proposed, ranging from approaches that evaluate particular aspects of individual visualization techniques, their perceptual characteristics, and even economic factors. Furthermore, there are approaches that attempt to provide means for measuring general properties of the visualization process as a whole. Measures can be quantitative or qualitative, and one of the primary goals is to provide objective means for reasoning about visualizations and their effectiveness. As such, they play a central role in the development of scientific theories for visualization. In this chapter, we provide an overview of the current state of the art, survey and classify different types of visualization measures, characterize their strengths and drawbacks, and provide an outline of open challenges for future research."}

Its base notion holds that the choice of metrics to be applied in a research assessment process depends upon the unit of assessment, the research dimension to be assessed, and the purposes and policy context of the assessment. An indicator may by highly useful within one assessment process, but less so in another. For instance, publication counts are useful tools to help discriminating between those staff members who are research active, and those who are not, but are of little value if active scientists are to be compared one another according to their research performance. This paper gives a systematic account of the potential usefulness and limitations of a set of 10 important metrics including altmetrics, applied at the level of individual articles, individual researchers, research groups and institutions. It presents a typology of research impact dimensions, and indicates which metrics are the most appropriate to measure each dimension. It introduces the concept of a meta-analysis of the units under assessment in which metrics are not used as tools to evaluate individual units, but to reach policy inferences regarding the objectives and general setup of an assessment process."}

A general consensus on extractive summarization is that both relevance and coverage are critical issues to address. The existing methods designed to model coverage can be characterized by either reducing redundancy or increasing diversity in the summary. Maximal margin relevance (MMR) is a widely-cited method since it takes both relevance and redundancy into account when generating a summary for a given document. In addition to MMR, there is only a dearth of research concentrating on reducing redundancy or increasing diversity for the spoken document summarization task, as far as we are aware. Motivated by these observations, two major contributions are presented in this paper. First, in contrast to MMR, which considers coverage by reducing redundancy, we propose two novel coverage-based methods, which directly increase diversity. With the proposed methods, a set of representative sentences, which not only are relevant to the given document but also cover most of the important sub-themes of the document, can be selected automatically. Second, we make a step forward to plug in several document/sentence representation methods into the proposed framework to further enhance the summarization performance. A series of empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods."}

The identification of translational science has practicality such as evaluating the effectiveness of investments made into large programs like the Clinical and Translational Science Awards. Despite several proposed methods that group publications---the primary unit of research output---into some categories, we still lack a quantitative way to place papers onto the full, continuous spectrum from basic research to clinical medicine. Methods: Here we learn vector-representations of controlled vocabularies assigned to MEDLINE papers to obtain a Translational Axis (TA) that points from basic science to clinical medicine. The projected position of a term on the TA, expressed by a continuous quantity, indicates the term's \"appliedness.\" The position of a paper, determined by the average location over its terms, quantifies the degree of its \"appliedness,\" which we term as \"level score.\" Results: We validate our method by comparing with previous techniques, showing excellent agreement yet uncovering significant variations of scores of papers in previously defined categories. The measure allows us to characterize the standing of journals, disciplines, and the entire biomedical literature along the basic-applied spectrum. Analysis on large-scale citation network reveals two main findings. First, direct citations mainly occurred between papers with similar scores. Second, shortest paths are more likely ended up with a paper closer to the basic end of the spectrum, regardless of where the starting paper is on the spectrum. Conclusions: The proposed method provides a quantitative way to identify translational science."}

While increasingly accessible science mapping tools enable end users to visualize the structure and dynamics of a research field, a common bottleneck in the current practice is the construction of a collection of scholarly publications as the input of the subsequent scientometric analysis and visualization. End users often have to face a dilemma in the preparation process: the more they know about a knowledge domain, the easier it is for them to find the relevant data to meet their needs adequately; the little they know, the harder the problem is. What can we do to avoid missing something valuable but beyond our initial description? In this article, we introduce a flexible and generic methodology, cascading citation expansion, to increase the quality of constructing a bibliographic dataset for systematic reviews. Furthermore, the methodology simplifies the conceptualization of globalism and localism in science mapping and unifies them on a consistent and continuous spectrum. We demonstrate an application of the methodology to the research of literature-based discovery and compare five datasets constructed based on three use scenarios, namely a conventional keyword-based search (one dataset), an expansion process starting with a groundbreaking article of the knowledge domain (two datasets), and an expansion process starting with a recently published review article by a prominent expert in the domain (two datasets). The unique coverage of each of the datasets is inspected through network visualization overlays with reference to other datasets in a broad and integrated context."}

In this paper, we present a new framework CTRLStruct for dialogue structure learning to effectively explore topic-level dialogue clusters as well as their transitions with unlabelled information. Precisely, dialogue utterances encoded by bi-directional Transformer are further trained through a special designed contrastive learning task to improve representation. Then we perform clustering to utterance-level representations and form topic-level clusters that can be considered as vertices in dialogue structure graph. The edges in the graph indicating transition probability between vertices are calculated by mimicking expert behavior in datasets. Finally, dialogue structure graph is integrated into dialogue model to perform controlled response generation. Experiments on two popular open-domain dialogue datasets show our model can generate more coherent responses compared to some excellent dialogue models, as well as outperform some typical sentence embedding methods in dialogue utterance representation.

It aims to condense lengthy documents into shorter versions while retaining the most critical information. Various methods have been proposed for text summarization, including extractive and abstractive summarization. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) like GPT3 and ChatGPT has recently created significant interest in using these models for text summarization tasks. Recent studies \\cite{goyal2022news, zhang2023benchmarking} have shown that LLMs-generated news summaries are already on par with humans. However, the performance of LLMs for more practical applications like aspect or query-based summaries is underexplored.

Our experiments reveal that ChatGPT's performance is comparable to traditional fine-tuning methods in terms of Rouge scores. Moreover, we highlight some unique differences between ChatGPT-generated summaries and human references, providing valuable insights into the superpower of ChatGPT for diverse text summarization tasks.

However, community concerns about these models' hallucination issues continue to rise. LLMs sometimes generate factually hallucinated summaries, which can be extremely harmful in the clinical domain NLP tasks (e.g., clinical note summarization), where factually incorrect statements can lead to critically erroneous diagnoses. Fine-tuning LLMs using human feedback has shown the promise of aligning LLMs to be factually consistent during generation, but such training procedure requires high-quality human-annotated data, which can be extremely expensive to get in the clinical domain. In this work, we propose a new pipeline using ChatGPT instead of human experts to generate high-quality feedback data for improving factual consistency in the clinical note summarization task. We focus specifically on edit feedback because recent work discusses the shortcomings of human alignment via preference feedback in complex situations (such as clinical NLP tasks that require extensive expert knowledge), as well as some advantages of collecting edit feedback from domain experts. In addition, although GPT has reached the expert level in many clinical NLP tasks (e.g., USMLE QA), there is not much previous work discussing whether GPT can generate expert-level edit feedback for LMs in the clinical note summarization task.

It is especially important to adhere to pre-approved terminology and adapt to corrected translations in domain-specific projects. Machine translation (MT) has achieved significant progress in the area of domain adaptation. However, in-domain data scarcity is common in translation settings, due to the lack of specialised datasets and terminology, or inconsistency and inaccuracy of available in-domain translations. In such scenarios where there is insufficient in-domain data to fine-tune MT models, producing translations that are consistent with the relevant context is challenging. While real-time adaptation can make use of smaller amounts of in-domain data to improve the translation on the fly, it remains challenging due to supported context limitations and efficiency constraints. Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown interesting capabilities of in-context learning, where they learn to replicate certain input-output text generation patterns, without further fine-tuning. Such capabilities have opened new horizons for domain-specific data augmentation and real-time adaptive MT. This work attempts to address two main relevant questions: 1) in scenarios involving human interaction and continuous feedback, can we employ language models to improve the quality of adaptive MT at inference time? and 2) in the absence of sufficient in-domain data, can we use pre-trained large-scale language models to improve the process of MT domain adaptation?"}

Nevertheless, their significant performance in tasks demanding a broad understanding and contextual processing shows their potential for translation. To exploit these abilities, we investigate using LLM's for MT and explore recent parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques. Surprisingly, our initial experiments find that fine-tuning for translation purposes even led to performance degradation. To overcome this, we propose an alternative approach: adapting LLM's as Automatic Post-Editors (APE) rather than direct translators. Building on the LLM's exceptional ability to process and generate lengthy sequences, we also propose extending our approach to document-level translation. We show that leveraging Low-Rank-Adapter fine-tuning for APE can yield significant improvements across both sentence and document-level metrics while generalizing to out-of-domain data. Most notably, we achieve a state-of-the-art accuracy rate of 89\\% on the ContraPro test set, which specifically assesses the model's ability to resolve pronoun ambiguities when translating from English to German. Lastly, we investigate a practical scenario involving manual post-editing for document-level translation, where reference context is made available.

GPT is trained on massive amounts of text data and uses deep learning techniques to learn patterns and relationships within the data, enabling it to generate coherent and contextually appropriate text. This position paper proposes using GPT technology to generate new process models when/if needed. We introduce ProcessGPT as a new technology that has the potential to enhance decision-making in data-centric and knowledge-intensive processes. ProcessGPT can be designed by training a generative pre-trained transformer model on a large dataset of business process data. This model can then be fine-tuned on specific process domains and trained to generate process flows and make decisions based on context and user input. The model can be integrated with NLP and machine learning techniques to provide insights and recommendations for process improvement. Furthermore, the model can automate repetitive tasks and improve process efficiency while enabling knowledge workers to communicate analysis findings, supporting evidence, and make decisions. ProcessGPT can revolutionize business process management (BPM) by offering a powerful tool for process augmentation, automation and improvement. Finally, we demonstrate how ProcessGPT can be a powerful tool for augmenting data engineers in maintaining data ecosystem processes within large bank organizations. Our scenario highlights the potential of this approach to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance the quality of business operations through the automation of data-centric and knowledge-intensive processes. These results underscore the promise of ProcessGPT as a transformative technology for organizations looking to improve their process workflows."}

Models are getting bigger and better on various tasks. However, Transformer models remain computationally challenging since they are not efficient at inference-time compared to traditional approaches. In this paper, we present FastFormers, a set of recipes to achieve efficient inference-time performance for Transformer-based models on various NLU tasks. We show how carefully utilizing knowledge distillation, structured pruning and numerical optimization can lead to drastic improvements on inference efficiency. We provide effective recipes that can guide practitioners to choose the best settings for various NLU tasks and pretrained models. Applying the proposed recipes to the SuperGLUE benchmark, we achieve from 9.8x up to 233.9x speed-up compared to out-of-the-box models on CPU. On GPU, we also achieve up to 12.4x speed-up with the presented methods. We show that FastFormers can drastically reduce cost of serving 100 million requests from 4,223 USD to just 18 USD on an Azure F16s_v2 instance.

Yet, addressing bias in AI, which risks worsening healthcare disparities, cannot be overlooked. This study reviews methods to detect and mitigate diverse forms of bias in AI models developed using EHR data. Methods: We conducted a systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, analyzing articles from PubMed, Web of Science, and IEEE published between January 1, 2010, and Dec 17, 2023. The review identified key biases, outlined strategies for detecting and mitigating bias throughout the AI model development process, and analyzed metrics for bias assessment. Results: Of the 450 articles retrieved, 20 met our criteria, revealing six major bias types: algorithmic, confounding, implicit, measurement, selection, and temporal. The AI models were primarily developed for predictive tasks in healthcare settings. Four studies concentrated on the detection of implicit and algorithmic biases employing fairness metrics like statistical parity, equal opportunity, and predictive equity. Sixty proposed various strategies for mitigating biases, especially targeting implicit and selection biases. These strategies, evaluated through both performance (e.g., accuracy, AUROC) and fairness metrics, predominantly involved data collection and preprocessing techniques like resampling, reweighting, and transformation. Discussion: This review highlights the varied and evolving nature of strategies to address bias in EHR-based AI models, emphasizing the urgent needs for the establishment of standardized, generalizable, and interpretable methodologies to foster the creation of ethical AI systems that promote fairness and equity in healthcare."}

Representation Bias in data can happen due to various reasons ranging from historical discrimination to selection and sampling biases in the data acquisition and preparation methods.

While there has been extensive study of fairness in machine learning models, including several review papers, bias in the data has been less studied. This paper reviews the literature on identifying and resolving representation bias as a feature of a data set, independent of how consumed later. The scope of this survey is bounded to structured (tabular) and unstructured (e.g., image, text, graph) data.

Then, we classify the dataset refinement algorithms into three categories based on the refinement process: data sampling, data subset selection, and active learning. In addition, we organize these dataset refinement methods according to the addressed data problems and provide a systematic comparative description. We point out that these three types of dataset refinement have distinct advantages and disadvantages for dataset problems, which informs the choice of the data-centric method appropriate to a particular research objective.

The self-attention architecture allows transformer to combine information from all elements of a sequence into context-aware representations. However, information about the context is stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. This might limit the processing of properties related to the sequence as a whole more difficult. Adding trainable memory to selectively store local as well as global representations of a sequence is a promising direction to improve the Transformer model. Memory-augmented neural networks (MANNs) extend traditional neural architectures with general-purpose memory for representations. MANNs have demonstrated the capability to learn simple algorithms like Copy or Reverse and can be successfully trained via backpropagation on diverse tasks from question answering to language modeling outperforming RNNs and LSTMs of comparable complexity. In this work, we propose and study few extensions of the Transformer baseline (1) by adding memory tokens to store non-local representations, (2) creating memory bottleneck for the global information, (3) controlling memory update with dedicated layer. We evaluate these memory augmented Transformers and demonstrate that presence of memory positively correlates with the model performance for machine translation and language modelling tasks.

However, there is an ongoing debate about how and when transformers can acquire highly structured behavior and achieve systematic generalization. Here, we explore how well a causal transformer can perform a set of algorithmic tasks, including copying, sorting, and hierarchical compositions of these operations. We demonstrate strong generalization to sequences longer than those used in training by replacing the standard positional encoding typically used in transformers with labels arbitrarily paired with items in the sequence. We search for the layer and head configuration sufficient to solve these tasks, then probe for signs of systematic processing in latent representations and attention patterns. We show that two-layer transformers learn reliable solutions to multi-level problems, develop signs of task decomposition, and encode input items in a way that encourages the exploitation of shared computation across related tasks. These results provide key insights into how attention layers support structured computation both within a task and across multiple tasks."}

Its effectiveness is partly due to its non-sequential architecture, which promotes scalability and parallelism but limits the model to inputs of a bounded length. In particular, such architectures perform poorly on algorithmic tasks, where the model must learn a procedure which generalizes to input lengths unseen in training, a capability we refer to as inductive generalization. Identifying the computational limits of existing self-attention mechanisms, we propose I-BERT, a bi-directional Transformer that replaces positional encodings with a recurrent layer. The model inductively generalizes on a variety of algorithmic tasks where state-of-the-art Transformer models fail to do so. We also test our method on masked language modeling tasks where training and validation sets are partitioned to verify inductive generalization. Out of three algorithmic and two natural language inductive generalization tasks, I-BERT achieves state-of-the-art results on four tasks."}

The self-attention mechanism in the transformer architecture is capable of capturing long-range dependencies and it is the main reason behind its effectiveness in processing sequential data. Nevertheless, despite their success, transformers have two significant drawbacks that still limit their applicability in online reinforcement learning: (1) in order to remember all past information, the self-attention mechanism requires access to the whole history to be provided as context. (2) The inference cost in transformers is expensive. In this paper, we introduce recurrent alternatives to the transformer self-attention mechanism that offer context-independent inference cost, leverage long-range dependencies effectively, and performs well in online reinforcement learning task. We quantify the impact of the different components of our architecture in a diagnostic environment and assess performance gains in 2D and 3D pixel-based partially-observable environments (e.g. T-Maze, Mystery Path, Craftax, and Memory Maze). Compared with a state-of-the-art architecture, GTrXL, inference in our approach is at least 40% cheaper while reducing memory use more than 50%. Our approach either performs similarly or better than GTrXL, improving more than 37% upon GTrXL performance in harder tasks."}

Nevertheless, most of existing designs directly employ self-attention over a 2D feature map to obtain the attention matrix based on pairs of isolated queries and keys at each spatial location, but leave the rich contexts among neighbor keys under-exploited. In this work, we design a novel Transformer-style module, i.e., Contextual Transformer (CoT) block, for visual recognition. Such design fully capitalizes on the contextual information among input keys to guide the learning of dynamic attention matrix and thus strengthens the capacity of visual representation. Technically, CoT block first contextually encodes input keys via a $3\\times3$ convolution, leading to a static contextual representation of inputs. We further concatenate the encoded keys with input queries to learn the dynamic multi-head attention matrix through two consecutive $1\\times1$ convolutions. The learnt attention matrix is multiplied by input values to achieve the dynamic contextual representation of inputs. The fusion of the static and dynamic contextual representations are finally taken as outputs. Our CoT block is appealing in the view that it can readily replace each $3\\times3$ convolution in ResNet architectures, yielding a Transformer-style backbone named as Contextual Transformer Networks (CoTNet). Through extensive experiments over a wide range of applications (e.g., image recognition, object detection and instance segmentation), we validate the superiority of CoTNet as a stronger backbone.

We interpret the original self-attention as a simple graph filter and redesign it from a graph signal processing (GSP) perspective. We propose a graph-filter-based self-attention (GFSA) to learn a general yet effective one, whose complexity, however, is slightly larger than that of the original self-attention mechanism.

In this paper, we demonstrate that the self-attention mechanism can be approximated by a low-rank matrix. We further exploit this finding to propose a new self-attention mechanism, which reduces the overall self-attention complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ in both time and space.

Most existing approaches leverage sparsity or low-rank assumptions in the attention matrix to reduce cost, but sacrifice expressiveness. Instead, we propose Combiner, which provides full attention capability in each attention head while maintaining low computation and memory complexity. The key idea is to treat the self-attention mechanism as a conditional expectation over embeddings at each location, and approximate the conditional distribution with a structured factorization. Each location can attend to all other locations, either via direct attention, or through indirect attention to abstractions, which are again conditional expectations of embeddings from corresponding local regions. We show that most sparse attention patterns used in existing sparse transformers are able to inspire the design of such factorization for full attention, resulting in the same sub-quadratic cost ($\\mathcal{O}(L\\log(L))$ or $\\mathcal{O}(L\\sqrt{L})$). Combiner is a drop-in replacement for attention layers in existing transformers and can be easily implemented in common frameworks.

Our architecture, by contrast, maintains both full expressiveness over joint distributions over data and ease of implementation with standard deep learning frameworks, while requiring reasonable memory and computation and achieving state-of-the-art results on standard generative modeling benchmarks. Our models are based on axial attention, a simple generalization of self-attention that naturally aligns with the multiple dimensions of the tensors in both the encoding and the decoding settings. Notably the proposed structure of the layers allows for the vast majority of the context to be computed in parallel during decoding without introducing any independence assumptions. This semi-parallel structure goes a long way to making decoding from even a very large Axial Transformer broadly applicable.

It causes the fluency of generated text to rapidly decrease when the control strength exceeds a critical value, rendering the text completely unusable. This limitation hinders the effectiveness of decoding methods in achieving high levels of controllability. To address this problem, we propose a novel lightweight decoding framework named Air-Decoding. Its main idea is reconstructing the attribute distributions to balance the weights between attribute words and non-attribute words to generate more fluent text. Specifically, we train prefixes by prefix-tuning to obtain attribute distributions. Then we design a novel attribute distribution reconstruction method to balance the obtained distributions and use the reconstructed distributions to guide language models for generation, effectively avoiding the issue of Attribute Collapse.

Transformers have been at the heart of these advancements where the cutting-edge transformer-based Language Models (LMs) have led to new state-of-the-art results in a wide spectrum of applications. While the number of research works involving neural LMs is exponentially increasing, their vast majority are high-level and far from self-contained. Consequently, a deep understanding of the literature in this area is a tough task especially in the absence of a unified mathematical framework explaining the main types of neural LMs. We address the aforementioned problem in this tutorial where the objective is to explain neural LMs in a detailed, simplified and unambiguous mathematical framework accompanied by clear graphical illustrations. Concrete examples on widely used models like BERT and GPT2 are explored. Finally, since transformers pretrained on language-modeling-like tasks have been widely adopted in computer vision and time series applications, we briefly explore some examples of such solutions in order to enable readers to understand how transformers work in the aforementioned domains and compare this use with the original one in NLP."}

However, the process of finetuning LLMs requires significant training resources and annotation work. In this paper, we explore the capability of generative models to generate descriptive text from graph data in a zero-shot setting. Specifically, we evaluate GPT-3 and ChatGPT on two graph-to-text datasets and compare their performance with that of finetuned LLM models such as T5 and BART. Our results demonstrate that generative models are capable of generating fluent and coherent text, achieving BLEU scores of 10.57 and 11.08 for the AGENDA and WebNLG datasets, respectively. However, our error analysis reveals that generative models still struggle with understanding the semantic relations between entities, and they also tend to generate text with hallucinations or irrelevant information. As a part of error analysis, we utilize BERT to detect machine-generated text and achieve high macro-F1 scores. We have made the text generated by generative models publicly available."}

We show that the PLMs BART and T5 achieve new state-of-the-art results and that task-adaptive pretraining strategies improve their performance even further. In particular, we report new state-of-the-art BLEU scores of 49.72 on LDC2017T10, 59.70 on WebNLG, and 25.66 on AGENDA datasets - a relative improvement of 31.8%, 4.5%, and 42.4%, respectively.

We experiment with eighteen different translation directions involving high and low resource languages, as well as non English-centric translations, and evaluate the performance of three GPT models: ChatGPT, GPT3.5 (text-davinci-003), and text-davinci-002. Our results show that GPT models achieve very competitive translation quality for high resource languages, while having limited capabilities for low resource languages. We also show that hybrid approaches, which combine GPT models with other translation systems, can further enhance the translation quality.

A drawback of existing PLM-based models is their non-Markov architectures across turns, i.e., the whole history is used as the conditioning input at each turn. First, this brings inefficiencies in memory and computation. Furthermore, using the whole history increases model complexity and may hurt the training efficiency, especially when facing small amounts of labeled training data (the low-resource setting). In this paper, motivated by the observation that dialog states could be viewed as Markov states, we propose to build Markovian Generative Architectures (MGA) over PLM backbones for efficient TOD systems. Experiments on MultiWOZ2.1 show that in the rich-resource setting, the proposed Markov models reduce memory and time costs without performance degradation; in the low-resource setting, the training efficiency of the Markov models is more significant."}

The novelty of this work lies in the use of language-specific prefixes, control tokens, and candidates extracted from pre-trained masked language models to learn simpler alternatives for complex words. The evaluation results on three well-known LS datasets -- LexMTurk, BenchLS, and NNSEval -- show that our model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art models like LSBert and ConLS. Moreover, further evaluation of our approach on the part of the recent TSAR-2022 multilingual LS shared-task dataset shows that our model performs competitively when compared with the participating systems for English LS and even outperforms the GPT-3 model on several metrics.

Inspired by the advancements of the GPT, we present PointGPT, a novel approach that extends the concept of GPT to point clouds, addressing the challenges associated with disorder properties, low information density, and task gaps. Specifically, a point cloud auto-regressive generation task is proposed to pre-train transformer models. Our method partitions the input point cloud into multiple point patches and arranges them in an ordered sequence based on their spatial proximity. Then, an extractor-generator based transformer decoder, with a dual masking strategy, learns latent representations conditioned on the preceding point patches, aiming to predict the next one in an auto-regressive manner. Our scalable approach allows for learning high-capacity models that generalize well, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various downstream tasks. In particular, our approach achieves classification accuracies of 94.9% on the ModelNet40 dataset and 93.4% on the ScanObjectNN dataset, outperforming all other transformer models. Furthermore, our method also attains new state-of-the-art accuracies on all four few-shot learning benchmarks."}

They have shifted the field from application-specific model pipelines to a single model that is adapted to a wide range of tasks. Autoregressive PLMs like GPT-3 or PaLM, alongside techniques like few-shot learning, have additionally shifted the output modality to generation instead of classification or regression. Despite their ubiquitous use, the generation quality of language models is rarely evaluated when these models are introduced. Additionally, it is unclear how existing generation tasks--while they can be used to compare systems at a high level--relate to the real world use cases for which people have been adopting them. In this work, we discuss how to adapt existing application-specific generation benchmarks to PLMs and provide an in-depth, empirical study of the limitations and capabilities of PLMs in natural language generation tasks along dimensions such as scale, architecture, input and output language. Our results show that PLMs differ in their applicability to different data regimes and their generalization to multiple languages and inform which PLMs to use for a given generation task setup. We share best practices to be taken into consideration when benchmarking generation capabilities during the development of upcoming PLMs."}

This paper comes to address this gap by presenting an empirical analysis of scalability and performance of inferencing a Transformer-based model on CPUs. Focusing on the highly popular BERT model, we identify key components of the Transformer architecture where the bulk of the computation happens, and propose three optimizations to speed them up.

Natural language generation (NLG) and generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models have revolutionized a variety of sectors: the scope not only permeated throughout journalism and customer service but also reached academia. To mitigate the hazardous implications that may arise from the use of these models, preventative measures must be implemented, such as providing human agents with the capacity to distinguish between artificially made and human composed texts utilizing automated systems and possibly reverse-engineered language models. Furthermore, to ensure a balanced and responsible approach, it is critical to have a full grasp of the socio-technological ramifications of these breakthroughs.

This opens up applications like text-to-video generation, image captioning, text-to-speech, and more and is achieved either by retro-fitting an LLM with multi-modal capabilities, or building a MM-LLM from scratch.

In the last decades, health care research benefited from new computer-based recruiting methods, the use of federated architectures for data storage, the introduction of innovative analyses of datasets, and so on. Nevertheless, health care datasets can still be affected by data bias. Due to data bias, they provide a distorted view of reality, leading to wrong analysis results and, consequently, decisions. For example, in a clinical trial that studied the risk of cardiovascular diseases, predictions were wrong due to the lack of data on ethnic minorities. It is, therefore, of paramount importance for researchers to acknowledge data bias that may be present in the datasets they use, eventually adopt techniques to mitigate them and control if and how analyses results are impacted. This paper proposes a method to address bias in datasets that: (i) defines the types of data bias that may be present in the dataset, (ii) characterizes and quantifies data bias with adequate metrics, (iii) provides guidelines to identify, measure, and mitigate data bias for different data sources. The method we propose is applicable both for prospective and retrospective clinical trials. We evaluate our proposal both through theoretical considerations and through interviews with researchers in the health care environment."}

A CRS mainly faces three key challenges: (1) at each turn, it must decide if recommending a KB entity is appropriate; if so, it must identify the most relevant KB entity to recommend; and finally, it must recommend the entity in a fluent utterance that is consistent with the conversation history. Recent CRSs do not pay sufficient attention to these desiderata, often generating unfluent responses or not recommending (relevant) entities at the right turn. We introduce a new CRS we call CoRE-CoG. CoRE-CoG addresses the limitations in prior systems by implementing (1) a recommendation trigger that decides if the system utterance should include an entity, (2) a type pruning module that improves the relevance of recommended entities, and (3) a novel constrained response generator to make recommendations while maintaining fluency. Together, these modules ensure simultaneous accurate recommendation decisions and fluent system utterances.

Recently, dialogue systems integrated with complementary information such as images, audio, or video have gained immense popularity. In this work, we propose an end-to-end framework with the capability to extract necessary slot values from the utterance and generate a coherent response, thereby assisting the user to achieve their desired goals in a multimodal dialogue system having both textual and visual information. The task of extracting the necessary information is dependent not only on the text but also on the visual cues present in the dialogue. Similarly, for the generation, the previous dialog context comprising multimodal information is significant for providing coherent and informative responses. We employ a multimodal hierarchical encoder using pre-trained DialoGPT and also exploit the knowledge base (Kb) to provide a stronger context for both the tasks. Finally, we design a slot attention mechanism to focus on the necessary information in a given utterance. Lastly, a decoder generates the corresponding response for the given dialogue context and the extracted slot values.

The most common type of medical data is the massive free-text electronic medical records (EMR). It is widely regarded that mining such massive data can bring up important information for improving medical practices as well as for possible new discoveries on complex diseases. However, the free EMR texts are lacking consistent standards, rich of private information, and limited in availability. Also, as they are accumulated from everyday practices, it is often hard to have a balanced number of samples for the types of diseases under study. These problems hinder the development of ML and NLP methods for EMR data analysis. To tackle these problems, we developed a model to generate synthetic text of EMRs called Medical Text Generative Adversarial Network or mtGAN. It is based on the GAN framework and is trained by the REINFORCE algorithm. It takes disease features as inputs and generates synthetic texts as EMRs for the corresponding diseases. We evaluate the model from micro-level, macro-level and application-level on a Chinese EMR text dataset. The results show that the method has a good capacity to fit real data and can generate realistic and diverse EMR samples. This provides a novel way to avoid potential leakage of patient privacy while still supply sufficient well-controlled cohort data for developing downstream ML and NLP methods.

A sparsity of language resources has hampered previous work on Indonesian. The Transformer is a new architecture rapidly becoming dominant for NLP, surpassing alternatives like convolutional and recurrent neural networks. T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) is a Transformer model that converts all text-based language problems to text-to-text format for English. The multilingual variant is mT5 (multilingual T5) which has shown promising results on many NLP tasks across languages. However, the size of this multilingual model is a drawback for its application in real production applications, which sometimes require only one language. In this study, the mT5 model was adapted for only one language, Indonesian, resulting in a pre-trained T5 model that was specific only for Indonesian with a smaller size. For performance comparison, we fine-tuned this model and the mT5 model to the Sentiment Analysis (SA), Question Generation (QG), and Question Answering (QA) tasks with the exact mechanism and dataset. Fine-tuned model based on our model achieved 77.18% accuracy on SA, 8% higher than the mT5-based model, and obtained nearly the same score as the mT5-based model on QG and QA. The results confirm that it is possible to produce a smaller pre-trained model that maintains comparable yields while reducing the model size by up to 58%. In addition, the resulting model requires less memory, loads faster, and inference times faster."}

However, these models contain a large amount of parameters. The emergence of even larger and more accurate models such as GPT2 and Megatron, suggest a trend of large pre-trained Transformer models. However, using these large models in production environments is a complex task requiring a large amount of compute, memory and power resources. In this work we show how to perform quantization-aware training during the fine-tuning phase of BERT in order to compress BERT by $4\\times$ with minimal accuracy loss. Furthermore, the produced quantized model can accelerate inference speed if it is optimized for 8bit Integer supporting hardware."}

The Transformer, for instance, is an illustrative example that generates abstract representations of tokens inputted to an encoder based on their relationships to all tokens in a sequence. Recent studies have shown that although such models are capable of learning syntactic features purely by seeing examples, explicitly feeding this information to deep learning models can significantly enhance their performance. Leveraging syntactic information like part of speech (POS) may be particularly beneficial in limited training data settings for complex models such as the Transformer. We show that the syntax-infused Transformer with multiple features achieves an improvement of 0.7 BLEU when trained on the full WMT 14 English to German translation dataset and a maximum improvement of 1.99 BLEU points when trained on a fraction of the dataset. In addition, we find that the incorporation of syntax into BERT fine-tuning outperforms baseline on a number of downstream tasks from the GLUE benchmark."}

It is pre-trained on a large set of annotated NLG corpus to acquire the controllable generation ability, and fine-tuned with only a few domain-specific labels to adapt to new domains.

Yet the natural language generation (NLG) component for many of these systems remains largely handcrafted. This limitation greatly restricts the range of applications; it also means that it is impossible to take advantage of recent work in expressive and statistical language generation that can dynamically and automatically produce a large number of variations of given content. We propose that a solution to this problem lies in new methods for developing language generation resources. We describe the ES-Translator, a computational language generator that has previously been applied only to fables, and quantitatively evaluate the domain independence of the EST by applying it to personal narratives from weblogs. We then take advantage of recent work on language generation to create a parameterized sentence planner for story generation that provides aggregation operations, variations in discourse and in point of view.

English as a foreign language (EFL) students' use of NLG tools might facilitate their idea generation, which is fundamental to creative writing. However, little is known about how EFL students interact with NLG tools to generate ideas. This study explores strategies adopted by EFL students when searching for ideas using NLG tools, evaluating ideas generated by NLG tools and selecting NLG tools for ideas generation. Four Hong Kong secondary school students attended workshops where they learned to write stories comprising their own words and words generated by NLG tools. After the workshops, they answered questions to reflect on their writing experience with NLG tools. In a thematic analysis of the written reflections, we found students may have existing ideas when searching for ideas and evaluating ideas with NLG tools. Students showed some aversion to ideas generated by NLG tools and selected NLG tools that generated a greater quantity of ideas. The findings inform our understanding of EFL students' concerns when using NLG tools for idea generation and can inform educators' instruction to implement NLG tools for classroom creative writing."}

This standard approach falls short, however, when a user's intent or context of work is not easily recoverable based solely on that source text -- a scenario that we argue is more of the rule than the exception. In this work, we argue that NLG systems in general should place a much higher level of emphasis on making use of additional context, and suggest that relevance (as used in Information Retrieval) be thought of as a crucial tool for designing user-oriented text-generating tasks. We further discuss possible harms and hazards around such personalization, and argue that value-sensitive design represents a crucial path forward through these challenges."}

We identify key stylistic and content coverage factors that characterize different types of summaries such as paper reviews, abstracts, and lay summaries. By controlling stylistic features, we find that non-fine-tuned LLMs outperform humans in the MuP review generation task, both in terms of similarity to reference summaries and human preferences. Also, we show that we can improve the controllability of LLMs with keyword-based classifier-free guidance (CFG) while achieving lexical overlap comparable to strong fine-tuned baselines on arXiv and PubMed. However, our results also indicate that LLMs cannot consistently generate long summaries with more than 8 sentences. Furthermore, these models exhibit limited capacity to produce highly abstractive lay summaries. Although LLMs demonstrate strong generic summarization competency, sophisticated content control without costly fine-tuning remains an open problem for domain-specific applications."}

Most of the current state-of-the-art NLP results are achieved by using monolingual transformer models, where the model is pre-trained using a single language unlabelled text corpus. Then, the model is fine-tuned to the specific downstream task. However, the cost of pre-training a new transformer model is high for most languages. In this work, we propose a cost-effective transfer learning method to adopt a strong source language model, trained from a large monolingual corpus to a low-resource language. Thus, using XLNet language model, we demonstrate competitive performance with mBERT and a pre-trained target language model on the cross-lingual sentiment (CLS) dataset and on a new sentiment analysis dataset for low-resourced language Tigrinya. With only 10k examples of the given Tigrinya sentiment analysis dataset, English XLNet has achieved 78.88% F1-Score outperforming BERT and mBERT by 10% and 7%, respectively. More interestingly, fine-tuning (English) XLNet model on the CLS dataset has promising results compared to mBERT and even outperformed mBERT for one dataset of the Japanese language."}

However, the issue of hallucination has parallelly emerged as a by-product, posing significant concerns. While some recent endeavors have been made to identify and mitigate different types of hallucination, there has been a limited emphasis on the nuanced categorization of hallucination and associated mitigation methods. To address this gap, we offer a fine-grained discourse on profiling hallucination based on its degree, orientation, and category, along with offering strategies for alleviation. As such, we define two overarching orientations of hallucination: (i) factual mirage (FM) and (ii) silver lining (SL). To provide a more comprehensive understanding, both orientations are further sub-categorized into intrinsic and extrinsic, with three degrees of severity - (i) mild, (ii) moderate, and (iii) alarming. We also meticulously categorize hallucination into six types: (i) acronym ambiguity, (ii) numeric nuisance, (iii) generated golem, (iv) virtual voice, (v) geographic erratum, and (vi) time wrap. Furthermore, we curate HallucInation eLiciTation (HILT), a publicly available dataset comprising of 75,000 samples generated using 15 contemporary LLMs along with human annotations for the aforementioned categories. Finally, to establish a method for quantifying and to offer a comparative spectrum that allows us to evaluate and rank LLMs based on their vulnerability to producing hallucinations, we propose Hallucination Vulnerability Index (HVI). We firmly believe that HVI holds significant value as a tool for the wider NLP community, with the potential to serve as a rubric in AI-related policy-making.

Building upon this discovery, we propose a novel sampling-based method, i.e., semantic-aware cross-check consistency (SAC3) that expands on the principle of self-consistency checking. Our SAC3 approach incorporates additional mechanisms to detect both question-level and model-level hallucinations by leveraging advances including semantically equivalent question perturbation and cross-model response consistency checking. Through extensive and systematic empirical analysis, we demonstrate that SAC3 outperforms the state of the art in detecting both non-factual and factual statements across multiple question-answering and open-domain generation benchmarks."}

However, while finetuning, what changes across layers in these models with respect to pretrained checkpoints is under-studied. Further, how robust are these models to perturbations in input text? Does the robustness vary depending on the NLP task for which the models have been finetuned? While there exists some work on studying the robustness of BERT finetuned for a few NLP tasks, there is no rigorous study that compares this robustness across encoder only, decoder only and encoder-decoder models. In this paper, we characterize changes between pretrained and finetuned language model representations across layers using two metrics: CKA and STIR. Further, we study the robustness of three language models (BERT, GPT-2 and T5) with eight different text perturbations on classification tasks from the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark, and generation tasks like summarization, free-form generation and question generation. GPT-2 representations are more robust than BERT and T5 across multiple types of input perturbation. Although models exhibit good robustness broadly, dropping nouns, verbs or changing characters are the most impactful. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into perturbation-specific weaknesses of popular Transformer-based models, which should be kept in mind when passing inputs.

However, in the presence of many downstream tasks, fine-tuning is parameter inefficient: an entire new model is required for every task. As an alternative, we propose transfer with adapter modules. Adapter modules yield a compact and extensible model; they add only a few trainable parameters per task, and new tasks can be added without revisiting previous ones. The parameters of the original network remain fixed, yielding a high degree of parameter sharing. To demonstrate adapter's effectiveness, we transfer the recently proposed BERT Transformer model to 26 diverse text classification tasks, including the GLUE benchmark. Adapters attain near state-of-the-art performance, whilst adding only a few parameters per task. On GLUE, we attain within 0.4% of the performance of full fine-tuning, adding only 3.6% parameters per task. By contrast, fine-tuning trains 100% of the parameters per task."}

Different PET methods utilize different manually designed tunable modules. In small PLMs, there are usually noticeable performance differences among PET methods.

To investigate this hypothesis, we introduce a more flexible PET method called Arbitrary PET (APET) method. The APET method is compatible with a tunable module, which consists of any number of parameters distributed in arbitrary positions. Then, we utilize it and conduct experiments on 11 NLP tasks across 3 representative PLMs. Our investigations reveal that model scaling (1) mitigates the effects of the positions of tunable parameters on performance, and (2) enables tuning methods to achieve performance comparable to full-parameter fine-tuning by optimizing fewer tunable parameters. Intriguingly, we also observe that tuning methods optimize the similar number of tunable parameters to exceed random guess performance on different tasks. We collectively discuss this phenomenon and the two aforementioned findings from an optimization perspective to understand the underlying mechanisms. These conclusions enhance our understanding of the impact of model scaling on PET and assist in designing more effective and efficient PET methods for PLMs of different scales.

However, due to their size, these VLLMs are extremely resource intensive and cumbersome to deploy at production time. Several recent publications have looked into various ways to distil knowledge from a transformer based VLLM (most commonly BERT-Base) into a smaller model which can run much faster at inference time. Here, we propose a novel set of techniques which together produce a task-specific hybrid convolutional and transformer model, WaLDORf, that achieves state-of-the-art inference speed while still being more accurate than previous distilled models."}

In this paper, we explore three carefully-designed light Transformer architectures to figure out whether the Transformer with less computations could produce competitive results. Experimental results on language model benchmark datasets hint that such trade-off is promising, and the light Transformer reduces 70% parameters at best, while obtains competitive perplexity compared to standard Transformer.

Domain-specific variants of these models have demonstrated excellent performance on a variety of specialised tasks. In legal NLP, BERT-based models have led to new state-of-the-art results on multiple tasks. The exploration of these models has demonstrated the importance of capturing the specificity of the legal language and its vocabulary. However, such approaches suffer from high computational costs, leading to a higher ecological impact and lower accessibility. Our findings, focusing on English language legal text, show that lightweight LSTM-based Language Models are able to capture enough information from a small legal text pretraining corpus and achieve excellent performance on short legal text classification tasks. This is achieved with a significantly reduced computational overhead compared to BERT-based models. However, our method also shows degraded performance on a more complex task, multi-label classification of longer documents, highlighting the limitations of this lightweight approach."}

Despite their success, large GPT models like GPT-4 face inherent limitations such as considerable size, high computational requirements, complex deployment processes, and closed development loops. These constraints restrict their widespread adoption and raise concerns regarding their responsible development and usage. The need for user-friendly, relatively small, and open-sourced alternative GPT models arises from the desire to overcome these limitations while retaining high performance. In this survey paper, we provide an examination of alternative open-sourced models of large GPTs, focusing on user-friendly and relatively small models that facilitate easier deployment and accessibility. Through this extensive survey, we aim to equip researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts with a thorough understanding of user-friendly and relatively small open-sourced models of large GPTs, their current state, challenges, and future research directions, inspiring the development of more efficient, accessible, and versatile GPT models that cater to the broader scientific community and advance the field of general artificial intelligence.

In research, datasets, metrics, techniques, and tools are applied to detect and mitigate algorithmic unfairness and bias. This study aims to examine existing knowledge on bias and unfairness in Machine Learning models, identifying mitigation methods, fairness metrics, and supporting tools. A Systematic Literature Review found 40 eligible articles published between 2017 and 2022 in the Scopus, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, and Google Scholar knowledge bases. The results show numerous bias and unfairness detection and mitigation approaches for ML technologies, with clearly defined metrics in the literature, and varied metrics can be highlighted. We recommend further research to define the techniques and metrics that should be employed in each case to standardize and ensure the impartiality of the machine learning model, thus, allowing the most appropriate metric to detect bias and unfairness in a given context."}

AI systems can help us make evidence-driven, efficient decisions, but can also confront us with unjustified, discriminatory decisions wrongly assumed to be accurate because they are made automatically and quantitatively. It is becoming evident that these technological developments are consequential to people's fundamental human rights. Despite increasing attention to these urgent challenges in recent years, technical solutions to these complex socio-ethical problems are often developed without empirical study of societal context and the critical input of societal stakeholders who are impacted by the technology. On the other hand, calls for more ethically- and socially-aware AI often fail to provide answers for how to proceed beyond stressing the importance of transparency, explainability, and fairness. Bridging these socio-technical gaps and the deep divide between abstract value language and design requirements is essential to facilitate nuanced, context-dependent design choices that will support moral and social values. In this paper, we bridge this divide through the framework of Design for Values, drawing on methodologies of Value Sensitive Design and Participatory Design to present a roadmap for proactively engaging societal stakeholders to translate fundamental human rights into context-dependent design requirements through a structured, inclusive, and transparent process."}

Investigating the salience of ethical AI issues among the German population", "abstract": "Building and implementing ethical AI systems that benefit the whole society is cost-intensive and a multi-faceted task fraught with potential problems. While computer science focuses mostly on the technical questions to mitigate social issues, social science addresses citizens' perceptions to elucidate social and political demands that influence the societal implementation of AI systems. Thus, in this study, we explore the salience of AI issues in the public with an emphasis on ethical criteria to investigate whether it is likely that ethical AI is actively requested by the population. Between May 2020 and April 2021, we conducted 15 surveys asking the German population about the most important AI-related issues (total of N=14,988 respondents). Our results show that the majority of respondents were not concerned with AI at all. However, it can be seen that general interest in AI and a higher educational level are predictive of some engagement with AI. Among those, who reported having thought about AI, specific applications (e.g., autonomous driving) were by far the most mentioned topics. Ethical issues are voiced only by a small subset of citizens with fairness, accountability, and transparency being the least mentioned ones. These have been identified in several ethical guidelines (including the EU Commission's proposal) as key elements for the development of ethical AI. The salience of ethical issues affects the behavioral intentions of citizens in the way that they 1) tend to avoid AI technology and 2) engage in public discussions about AI. We conclude that the low level of ethical implications may pose a serious problem for the actual implementation of ethical AI for the Common Good and emphasize that those who are presumably most affected by ethical issues of AI are especially unaware of ethical risks. Yet, once ethical AI is top of the mind, there is some potential for activism."}

To prevent algorithmic disparities, fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics (FATE) in AI are being implemented. However, the current discourse on these issues is largely dominated by more economically developed countries (MEDC), leaving out local knowledge, cultural pluralism, and global fairness. This study aims to address this gap by examining FATE-related desiderata, particularly transparency and ethics, in areas of the global South that are underserved by AI. A user study (n=43) and a participatory session (n=30) were conducted to achieve this goal. The results showed that AI models can encode bias and amplify stereotypes. To promote inclusivity, a community-led strategy is proposed to collect and curate representative data for responsible AI design. This will enable the affected community or individuals to monitor the increasing use of AI-powered systems. Additionally, recommendations based on public input are provided to ensure that AI adheres to social values and context-specific FATE needs."}

While research aiming to mitigate these issues is inherently interdisciplinary, the design of unbiased algorithms and fair socio-technical systems are key desired outcomes which depend on practitioners from the fields of data science and computing. However, these computing fields broadly also suffer from the same under-representation issues that are found in the datasets we analyze. This disconnect affects the design of both the desired outcomes and metrics by which we measure success. If the ethical AI research community accepts this, we tacitly endorse the status quo and contradict the goals of non-discrimination and equity which work on algorithmic fairness, accountability, and transparency seeks to address. Therefore, we advocate in this work for diversifying computing as a core priority of the field and our efforts to achieve ethical AI practices. We draw connections between the lack of diversity within academic and professional computing fields and the type and breadth of the biases encountered in datasets, machine learning models, problem formulations, and interpretation of results. Examining the current fairness/ethics in AI literature, we highlight cases where this lack of diverse perspectives has been foundational to the inequity in treatment of underrepresented and protected group data. We also look to other professional communities, such as in law and health, where disparities have been reduced both in the educational diversity of trainees and among professional practices. We use these lessons to develop recommendations that provide concrete steps for the computing community to increase diversity."}

Much of this research comes from outside of the practicing data science community, leaving its members with little concrete guidance to proactively address these concerns. This article introduces issues of discrimination to the data science community on its own terms. In it, we tour the familiar data mining process while providing a taxonomy of common practices that have the potential to produce unintended discrimination. We also survey how discrimination is commonly measured, and suggest how familiar development processes can be augmented to mitigate systems' discriminatory potential. We advocate that data scientists should be intentional about modeling and reducing discriminatory outcomes. Without doing so, their efforts will result in perpetuating any systemic discrimination that may exist, but under a misleading veil of data-driven objectivity."}

The growing research on bias, fairness, and transparency in computational systems aims to illuminate and mitigate harms, and could thus help inform reflections on possible negative impacts of particular pieces of technical work. The prevalent notion of computational harms -- narrowly construed as either allocational or representational harms -- does not fully capture the open, context dependent, and unobservable nature of harms across the wide range of AI infused systems.The current literature focuses on a small range of examples of harms to motivate algorithmic fixes, overlooking the wider scope of probable harms and the way these harms might affect different stakeholders. The system affordances may also exacerbate harms in unpredictable ways, as they determine stakeholders' control(including of non-users) over how they use and interact with a system output. To effectively assist in anticipating harmful uses, we argue that frameworks of harms must be context-aware and consider a wider range of potential stakeholders, system affordances, as well as viable proxies for assessing harms in the widest sense."}

So far, summarization researchers have given considerably more attention to relevance than to background knowledge. In contrast, this work puts background knowledge in the foreground. Building on the realization that the choices made by human summarizers and annotators contain implicit information about their background knowledge, we develop and compare techniques for inferring background knowledge from summarization data. Based on this framework, we define summary scoring functions that explicitly model background knowledge, and show that these scoring functions fit human judgments significantly better than baselines. We illustrate some of the many potential applications of our framework. First, we provide insights into human information importance priors. Second, we demonstrate that averaging the background knowledge of multiple, potentially biased annotators or corpora greatly improves summary-scoring performance. Finally, we discuss potential applications of our framework beyond summarization."}

In previous work, there are two problems left unsolved: neglect of sentiment beneath the text and insufficient utilization of topic-related knowledge. Therefore, we propose a novel Sentiment-Controllable topic-to-essay generator with a Topic Knowledge Graph enhanced decoder, named SCTKG, which is based on the conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) framework. We firstly inject the sentiment information into the generator for controlling sentiment for each sentence, which leads to various generated essays. Then we design a Topic Knowledge Graph enhanced decoder. Unlike existing models that use knowledge entities separately, our model treats the knowledge graph as a whole and encodes more structured, connected semantic information in the graph to generate a more relevant essay. Experimental results show that our SCTKG can generate sentiment controllable essays and outperform the state-of-the-art approach in terms of topic relevance, fluency, and diversity on both automatic and human evaluation."}

As such, it is crucial that NLG systems are trustworthy and reliable, for example by indicating when they are likely to be wrong; and supporting multiple views, backgrounds and writing styles -- reflecting diverse human sub-populations. In this paper, we argue that a principled treatment of uncertainty can assist in creating systems and evaluation protocols better aligned with these goals. We first present the fundamental theory, frameworks and vocabulary required to represent uncertainty. We then characterise the main sources of uncertainty in NLG from a linguistic perspective, and propose a two-dimensional taxonomy that is more informative and faithful than the popular aleatoric/epistemic dichotomy. Finally, we move from theory to applications and highlight exciting research directions that exploit uncertainty to power decoding, controllable generation, self-assessment, selective answering, active learning and more."}

However, such generative commonsense reasoning (GCSR) skills are lacking in state-of-the-art text generation methods. Descriptive sentences about arbitrary concepts generated by neural text generation models (e.g., pre-trained text-to-text Transformers) are often grammatically fluent but may not correspond to human common sense, largely due to their lack of mechanisms to capture concept relations, to identify implicit concepts, and to perform generalizable reasoning about unseen concept compositions. In this paper, we propose an Imagine-and-Verbalize (I&V) method, which learns to imagine a relational scene knowledge graph (SKG) with relations between the input concepts, and leverage the SKG as a constraint when generating a plausible scene description. We collect and harmonize a set of knowledge resources from different domains and modalities, providing a rich auxiliary supervision signal for I&V. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of I&V in improving language models on both concept-to-sentence and concept-to-story generation tasks, while enabling the model to learn well from fewer task examples and generate SKGs that make common sense to human annotators."}

In this general framework, efficiency is characterised as the parsimonious regulation of production and comprehension costs while effectiveness is measured with respect to task-oriented and contextually grounded communicative goals. We provide concrete suggestions for the estimation of goals, costs, and utility via modern statistical methods, demonstrating applications of our framework to the classic pragmatic task of visually grounded referential games and to abstractive text summarisation, two popular generation tasks with real-world applications. In sum, we advocate for the development of NLG systems that learn to make pragmatic production decisions from experience, by reasoning about goals, costs, and utility in a human-like way."}

In terms of deployment, we offer a comparison of the performance of different LLMs across various medical tasks, and further compare them with state-of-the-art lightweight models, aiming to provide an understanding of the advantages and limitations of LLMs in medicine. Overall, in this review, we address the following questions: 1) What are the practices for developing medical LLMs 2) How to measure the medical task performance of LLMs in a medical setting? 3) How have medical LLMs been employed in real-world practice? 4) What challenges arise from the use of medical LLMs? and 5) How to more effectively develop and deploy medical LLMs?

One of the common trends in these recent models is a significant increase in model complexity, which introduces both more weights and computation. Moreover, with the advent of large-scale unsupervised datasets, training time is further extended due to the increased amount of data samples within a single training epoch. As a result, to train these models within a reasonable time, machine learning (ML) programmers often require advanced hardware setups such as the premium GPU-enabled NVIDIA DGX workstations or specialized accelerators such as Google's TPU Pods. Our work addresses this limitation and demonstrates that the BERT pre-trained model can be trained within 2 weeks on an academic-size cluster of widely available GPUs through careful algorithmic and software optimizations. In this paper, we present these optimizations on how to improve single device training throughput, distribute the training workload over multiple nodes and GPUs, and overcome the communication bottleneck introduced by the large data exchanges over the network. We show that we are able to perform pre-training on BERT within a reasonable time budget (12 days) in an academic setting, but with a much less expensive and less aggressive hardware resource requirement than in previously demonstrated industrial settings based on NVIDIA DGX machines or Google's TPU Pods."}
