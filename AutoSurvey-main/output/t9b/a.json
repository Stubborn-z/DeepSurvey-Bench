    "survey": "# A Comprehensive Survey of Controllable Text Generation Using Transformer-Based Pre-Trained Language Models\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\n### 1.1 Overview of Controllable Text Generation (CTG)\n\n---\nControllable Text Generation (CTG) represents a pivotal advancement in Natural Language Generation (NLG), enabling the production of text that adheres to specific constraints or attributes while maintaining coherence and fluency. This capability addresses a critical limitation of traditional language models, which often generate generic, unfaithful, or biased outputs when deployed in real-world applications. The emergence of transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) has revolutionized CTG by providing flexible frameworks for fine-grained control over generated content, making it indispensable across diverse domains [1].  \n\n### Core Concepts and Evolution of CTG  \nAt its core, CTG refers to the systematic modulation of text generation to satisfy predefined conditions, such as stylistic preferences, emotional tones, factual accuracy, or domain-specific requirements. Early approaches relied on rigid rule-based systems or template filling, which lacked scalability for complex tasks. The shift to neural networks—and later, transformer-based PLMs—enabled data-driven control through fine-tuning, conditioning, or latent space manipulation. For example, attribute-based methods like those in [2] use continuous vector representations to guide generation without extensive retraining, while frameworks such as [3] disentangle stylistic and semantic constraints for nuanced control.  \n\n### Motivations and Applications  \nThe need for CTG arises from both technical and practical imperatives. Technically, large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3, despite their fluency, often struggle with domain-specific accuracy or ethical alignment, risking hallucinations or biased outputs in high-stakes settings like healthcare and law [4]. Practically, CTG enables personalized and context-aware generation, such as educational questions aligned with Bloom’s taxonomy [5] or play scripts adhering to thematic constraints [6].  \n\nKey applications highlight CTG’s versatility:  \n- **Dialogue Systems**: Ensuring responses exhibit empathy, formality, or task correctness, as in customer service or educational chatbots.  \n- **Creative Writing**: Assisting authors with genre-specific tone or narrative consistency.  \n- **Bias Mitigation**: Reducing stereotypes via frameworks like [7], which dynamically modulate attribute words to balance fairness and fluency.  \n\n### Challenges and Ethical Considerations  \nCTG faces multifaceted challenges. Technically, balancing multiple attributes (e.g., emotional expressiveness and factual accuracy) can degrade fluency, as noted in [3]. Ethically, safeguards are needed to prevent misuse, such as generating misleading content. Robust evaluation frameworks, like those proposed in [8], are critical to ensure reliability.  \n\n### Conclusion  \nCTG marks a paradigm shift in NLG, bridging human creativity and machine efficiency. Its evolution—from rule-based systems to PLM-driven approaches—reflects progress in addressing controllability, fairness, and scalability. As CTG methodologies advance, they promise to unlock new possibilities for human-machine collaboration, tailoring text to the nuanced needs of diverse users and domains [1].  \n---\n\n### 1.2 Significance of CTG Across Domains\n\nControllable Text Generation (CTG) has emerged as a pivotal technology across diverse domains, enabling the creation of contextually appropriate, stylistically consistent, and domain-specific textual content. Building on the foundational concepts and motivations outlined earlier, this subsection explores the transformative applications of CTG, emphasizing how transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) address real-world challenges in machine translation, summarization, style transfer, and specialized domains like healthcare and legal processing.  \n\n### Machine Translation  \nMachine translation (MT) exemplifies the power of CTG to preserve meaning and style across languages while adapting to domain-specific requirements. Recent advancements in multilingual PLMs have significantly improved translation quality, particularly in low-resource and specialized settings. For instance, [9] demonstrates the effectiveness of transfer learning for clinical text translation, achieving top-tier performance in the ClinSpEn-2022 shared task. Similarly, [10] reveals that fine-tuned LLMs can outperform GPT-4 in certain language pairs, highlighting CTG’s potential to address challenges like domain adaptation and terminology consistency.  \n\n### Summarization  \nText summarization leverages CTG to condense lengthy documents into concise, informative summaries—a capability with profound implications for domains like healthcare and law. In healthcare, [11] shows that T5 and BART models outperform rule-based systems in generating clinical problem lists. Further, [12] demonstrates that fine-tuned LLMs match or exceed medical experts in 81% of cases, alleviating documentation burdens. Legal applications are equally compelling: [13] achieves state-of-the-art results through multi-task learning, while [14] reveals hybrid methods can rival human-written summaries for business articles.  \n\n### Style Transfer  \nStyle transfer showcases CTG’s ability to bridge communication gaps by modifying stylistic attributes (e.g., tone, formality) without altering core meaning. In healthcare, [15] introduces a pretraining task that improves medical jargon simplification by 106% in human evaluations. Similarly, [16] provides insights for preserving content during formality transfer in dialogues, underscoring CTG’s role in enhancing accessibility.  \n\n### Domain-Specific Applications  \nHealthcare and legal domains highlight CTG’s precision in high-stakes settings. ClinicalGPT, a specialized LLM [17], outperforms general-purpose models in medical QA and diagnostics, while [18] enhances factuality via retrieval-augmented generation. In law, [19] emphasizes domain-specific fine-tuning, and [20] aligns model decisions with legal reasoning, streamlining workflows.  \n\n### Cross-Domain and Low-Resource Scenarios  \nCTG’s adaptability shines in challenging scenarios. [21] proposes strategies to mitigate domain shifts, while [22] demonstrates LLMs’ capability to handle historical and multilingual texts, expanding CTG’s reach.  \n\n### Ethical and Practical Considerations  \nDespite its promise, CTG deployment requires rigorous safeguards. [23] identifies risks of erroneous translations in critical contexts, and [24] reveals gaps in evaluating medical summary factuality, underscoring the need for robust evaluation frameworks.  \n\n### Conclusion  \nAs illustrated, CTG’s significance lies in its ability to enhance communication, streamline workflows, and improve decision-making across domains. The integration of transformer-based PLMs enables nuanced control over text generation, addressing challenges like domain specificity and low-resource adaptation. However, as discussed in the subsequent subsection on architectural foundations, ongoing innovation must balance technical advancements with ethical responsibility to fully realize CTG’s transformative potential.\n\n### 1.3 Role of Transformer-Based Pre-Trained Language Models (PLMs)\n\n---\nThe advent of transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) has revolutionized Controllable Text Generation (CTG), enabling unprecedented control over text attributes like style, tone, and domain specificity. This subsection examines how transformer architectures and their evolutionary advancements have shaped CTG capabilities, while also addressing persistent challenges and future directions.\n\n### Architectural Foundations for CTG\nThe transformer architecture, introduced by Vaswani et al., overcame key limitations of earlier sequential models through self-attention mechanisms, enabling parallel processing and superior capture of long-range dependencies. This breakthrough proved particularly transformative for CTG, as the architecture supports both autoregressive (GPT-style) and bidirectional (BERT-style) generation paradigms. The former excels in open-ended generation tasks, while the latter enhances semantic control for applications like summarization and dialogue systems [1]. Pre-training objectives such as masked language modeling (BERT) and autoregressive prediction (GPT) further enabled these models to learn universal representations that could be efficiently adapted to specific CTG tasks with minimal fine-tuning data.\n\n### Evolutionary Milestones in PLMs for CTG\nThe progression of transformer-based PLMs has followed three key trajectories: scale, specialization, and efficiency. Initial models like GPT-1 and BERT demonstrated the viability of large-scale pre-training, while subsequent iterations (GPT-2/3, T5) scaled parameters and introduced few-shot learning capabilities for finer-grained control [25]. The development of multilingual models (mBERT, XLM-R) extended CTG benefits to diverse languages, with architectures like mT5 achieving state-of-the-art performance in cross-lingual applications [26]. Concurrently, domain-specific adaptations emerged, such as BioGPT for biomedical text and LegaLMFiT for legal documents, demonstrating how task-adaptive pretraining could enhance precision in specialized domains [27].\n\n### Efficiency and Real-World Adaptations\nAs CTG applications expanded, efficiency became paramount. Techniques like quantization (Q8BERT) and distillation (MiniLM) reduced computational demands, while architectural innovations like sparse attention improved inference speed [28]. The Residual Memory Transformer exemplified this trend, introducing lightweight control mechanisms for GPT-style models without compromising performance [29]. These advancements enabled practical deployment in resource-constrained environments while maintaining the nuanced control required for applications like healthcare documentation and legal text generation.\n\n### Persistent Challenges and Emerging Solutions\nDespite progress, transformer-based CTG faces significant hurdles. Bias amplification remains prevalent, with studies showing PLMs can perpetuate harmful stereotypes present in training data [30]. Hallucination—the generation of plausible but incorrect content—poses particular risks in high-stakes domains [31]. Emerging solutions include multimodal architectures (e.g., CogView2 for text-to-image generation) and open-source alternatives (GPT-Neo) that promote accessibility while addressing ethical concerns [32]. Future research directions emphasize smaller, more efficient models and enhanced evaluation frameworks to ensure responsible deployment across languages and domains.\n\nThis evolutionary trajectory demonstrates how transformer-based PLMs have become indispensable for CTG, balancing increasing sophistication with practical deployability. As discussed in the following subsection on key challenges, ongoing innovation must address technical limitations while ensuring these powerful tools align with ethical and societal needs.\n\n### 1.4 Key Challenges in CTG\n\n---\n### 1.4 Key Challenges in CTG  \n\nWhile transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) have significantly advanced Controllable Text Generation (CTG), several persistent challenges hinder their reliable deployment across applications. These challenges—spanning technical limitations, ethical concerns, and practical constraints—require urgent attention to ensure CTG systems are both effective and responsible. Building on the evolutionary progress outlined in Section 1.3, this subsection systematically examines these barriers and their interdependencies, while connecting to the survey's broader objectives in Section 1.5.  \n\n#### Bias and Fairness in CTG  \nBias amplification remains a critical issue, as PLMs often perpetuate societal prejudices embedded in their training data. Gender, racial, and cultural biases manifest in generated text, particularly in sensitive domains like healthcare and legal systems [33]. For instance, [34] reveals GPT-3.5's tendency to disproportionately decline answering prompts about women, exposing systemic retrieval biases. Mitigation efforts face inherent tensions: fairness is context-dependent [35], and techniques like adversarial debiasing may compromise accuracy or introduce new biases [36]. The interdisciplinary nature of this challenge—spanning technical, legal, and ethical domains—demands holistic solutions [37].  \n\n#### Hallucination and Factual Inconsistency  \nThe generation of plausible but factually incorrect content (hallucination) poses significant risks, especially in precision-critical fields like finance and medicine [38]. Studies show even state-of-the-art models like GPT-4 propagate errors through over-commitment to initial mistakes [39]. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and self-verification pipelines offer partial solutions [40], their reliance on external knowledge bases limits scalability [41]. The lack of standardized benchmarks further complicates progress, as noted in [42], which calls for domain-specific evaluation frameworks.  \n\n#### Computational and Environmental Costs  \nThe resource intensity of CTG systems creates barriers to accessibility and sustainability. Training models like GPT-3 requires thousands of GPU hours, exacerbating inequities in research and deployment [43]. Although efficiency techniques (e.g., model distillation, sparse attention) reduce costs, they often sacrifice performance in low-resource settings [44]. The environmental impact is equally concerning, with large-scale training contributing significantly to carbon emissions [45].  \n\n#### Data Scarcity and Representation Gaps  \nHigh-quality training data is scarce for low-resource languages and specialized domains, perpetuating biases and limiting model robustness [46]. Annotation challenges for underrepresented populations further compound this issue [47], while synthetic data generation risks amplifying noise or existing biases [48]. Ethical constraints around data collection, such as privacy and consent, add another layer of complexity [49].  \n\n#### Ethical and Societal Implications  \nBeyond technical limitations, CTG raises profound ethical questions around misuse (e.g., misinformation, deepfakes) and accountability [50]. Frameworks like FATE (Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics) aim to address these concerns but face implementation hurdles, such as legal barriers to collecting sensitive attribute data [51].  \n\n#### Future Directions  \nAddressing these challenges requires:  \n1. **Standardized Evaluation**: Developing metrics for bias and hallucination benchmarking [33].  \n2. **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: Integrating social, legal, and technical insights [52].  \n3. **Lightweight Solutions**: Prioritizing efficient, interpretable methods to democratize access [53].  \n\nAs this survey transitions to its structural overview in Section 1.5, these unresolved issues underscore the need for balanced innovation—advancing CTG capabilities while ensuring ethical alignment and practical deployability.  \n---\n\n### 1.5 Objectives and Structure of the Survey\n\n---\n### 1.5 Objectives and Structure of the Survey  \n\nThis survey provides a comprehensive and systematic overview of controllable text generation (CTG) using transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs), building upon the challenges outlined in Section 1.4.

By integrating insights from diverse domains [65], it aims to inspire novel solutions and foster interdisciplinary collaboration for ethical and impactful text generation systems.  \n\n---\n\n## 2 Foundations of Transformer-Based PLMs for CTG\n\n### 2.1 Transformer Architecture and Core Components\n\n---\nThe transformer architecture, introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017), has become the cornerstone of modern pre-trained language models (PLMs) due to its ability to capture long-range dependencies and enable parallel processing. This subsection provides a detailed breakdown of the transformer architecture, focusing on its core components—self-attention mechanisms, positional embeddings, and layer normalization—and their collective role in enabling context-aware representations and efficient parallel processing. These features are critical for controllable text generation (CTG), where fine-grained control over text attributes and coherence is required.\n\n### Self-Attention Mechanisms\nAt the core of the transformer architecture lies the self-attention mechanism, which dynamically computes relationships between all pairs of words in a sequence. Unlike traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that process sequences sequentially, self-attention operates in parallel, using Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) matrices to compute attention scores. These scores, derived from the scaled dot product of Q and K followed by a softmax operation, determine the importance of each word relative to others. The multi-head attention variant further enhances this capability by splitting attention into multiple \"heads,\" each capturing distinct linguistic patterns (e.g., syntactic or semantic relationships). This flexibility is particularly advantageous for CTG tasks, such as sentiment transformation or toxicity mitigation, where precise attribute control is essential [2] [7].\n\n### Positional Embeddings\nSince transformers lack inherent sequential processing, positional embeddings are indispensable for encoding word order. These embeddings, either learned or sinusoidal, are added to token embeddings to convey positional information. Sinusoidal embeddings, used in the original transformer, employ sine and cosine functions to generalize to unseen sequence lengths. Positional embeddings are vital for CTG tasks requiring strict syntactic or structural coherence, such as dialogue generation or table-to-text conversion [75] [76]. Recent innovations, like dynamic positional embeddings, further improve adaptability to varying input lengths [1].\n\n### Layer Normalization\nLayer normalization (LayerNorm) stabilizes training in deep transformer models by normalizing activations across the feature dimension for each sample. Applied after self-attention and feed-forward layers, LayerNorm mitigates gradient issues and ensures stable activations, particularly for variable-length sequences in NLP. In CTG, LayerNorm is crucial for fine-tuning pre-trained models to specialized domains (e.g., legal or medical texts) and for parameter-efficient techniques like adapters, where maintaining stable representations is paramount [2].\n\n### Context-Aware Representations and Parallel Processing\nThe synergy of self-attention, positional embeddings, and LayerNorm enables transformers to generate context-aware representations. Self-attention captures global dependencies, positional embeddings preserve word order, and LayerNorm ensures stable training. This combination is essential for tasks like sentiment-controlled generation, where context and attribute alignment are key [3]. Additionally, the parallel processing capability of transformers—computing attention scores for all positions simultaneously—scales efficiently for large datasets and complex CTG constraints, such as multi-attribute control [8].\n\n### Conclusion\nThe transformer's core components—self-attention, positional embeddings, and LayerNorm—collectively empower PLMs with context-aware representations and parallel processing, making them indispensable for CTG. Advances like multi-head attention and dynamic positional embeddings continue to expand their capabilities, solidifying transformers as the backbone of modern text generation systems. Future optimizations of these components promise even greater precision and adaptability in CTG tasks [1].  \n---\n\n### 2.2 Pre-Training Paradigms and Objectives\n\n---\n2.2 Pre-Training Paradigms and Objectives  \n\nThe effectiveness of transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) in controllable text generation (CTG) is fundamentally shaped by their pre-training objectives and architectural paradigms. Building on the transformer architecture's capabilities (Section 2.1), these objectives determine how models capture linguistic patterns, contextual relationships, and domain-specific knowledge—critical factors for fine-grained control in downstream tasks. This subsection systematically examines three dominant pre-training paradigms—masked language modeling (MLM), autoregressive modeling, and sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) learning—while analyzing how encoder-only, decoder-only, and encoder-decoder architectures influence CTG performance.  \n\n### Masked Language Modeling (MLM)  \nMLM, introduced by BERT, trains models to predict randomly masked tokens using bidirectional context. This objective excels in capturing deep syntactic and semantic relationships, making it ideal for tasks requiring comprehensive contextual analysis. For instance, BERT variants achieve state-of-the-art performance in legal document classification and clinical entity recognition by leveraging bidirectional attention [19] [11]. However, MLM's non-autoregressive nature limits its fluency in generative tasks, creating a gap between understanding and generation capabilities—a challenge later addressed by hybrid architectures (Section 2.3).  \n\n### Autoregressive Modeling  \nAutoregressive models like GPT generate text sequentially by predicting each token conditioned on preceding tokens. This unidirectional approach prioritizes fluency and coherence, enabling breakthroughs in dialogue systems [77] and creative writing. The paradigm's generative strength is exemplified by ChatGPT's ability to produce human-like responses through large-scale pre-training [78]. However, its inability to incorporate future context can compromise factual consistency—evident in medical summarization tasks where GPT-3 may generate plausible but inaccurate content [12]. This limitation motivated the development of encoder-decoder models that balance generation with contextual understanding.  \n\n### Sequence-to-Sequence Learning  \nSeq2seq models (e.g., T5, BART) unify encoding and decoding through objectives like denoising autoencoding, where models reconstruct corrupted input text. Their versatility supports diverse CTG tasks, from multilingual translation [10] to style transfer [15]. T5's text-to-text framework demonstrates how unified training across tasks enhances adaptability [26], while BART's denoising objective improves faithfulness in domain-specific summarization [79]. These architectures bridge the gap between BERT's contextual depth and GPT's generative fluency, foreshadowing the efficiency-focused innovations discussed in Section 2.3.  \n\n### Architectural Trade-offs for CTG  \nThe choice of architecture involves key trade-offs:  \n1. **Encoder-Only (BERT)**: Optimized for context-heavy tasks like legal text analysis but requires auxiliary decoders for generation [80].  \n2. **Decoder-Only (GPT)**: Dominates open-ended generation but struggles with controlled, context-dependent outputs [81].  \n3. **Encoder-Decoder (T5/BART)**: Balances understanding and generation, enabling robust performance in summarization [82] and adaptive machine translation [83].  \n\n### Evolving Objectives for Enhanced Controllability  \nRecent advances address paradigm limitations through:  \n- **Domain-Specialized Hybrids**: BioBERT combines MLM with seq2seq fine-tuning for biomedical generation [84].  \n- **Retrieval-Augmented Training**: Improves factual grounding in autoregressive models [85].  \n- **Continual Pre-Training**: Enhances niche applications like legal text generation [86].  \n\n### Conclusion  \nPre-training paradigms and architectural choices form the foundation for CTG capabilities. While MLM excels in understanding, autoregressive models lead in fluency, and seq2seq architectures offer a middle ground—themes further developed in Section 2.3's discussion of model evolution. Future progress hinges on hybrid objectives and domain-aware adaptations to achieve precise control without sacrificing generative quality.  \n---\n\n### 2.3 Evolution of Transformer-Based PLMs\n\nThe evolution of transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) has progressed through distinct phases of innovation, each addressing key challenges in scalability, efficiency, and adaptability. This subsection systematically traces this progression, connecting architectural advancements to their implications for controllable text generation (CTG) while bridging the pre-training paradigms discussed in Section 2.2 and the multilingual/domain-specific adaptations explored in Section 2.4.  \n\n### Foundational Models: BERT and GPT  \nThe field was revolutionized by BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), which established the encoder-only and decoder-only paradigms, respectively. BERT's bidirectional masked language modeling (MLM) excelled in natural language understanding (NLU) tasks by capturing contextual relationships [87], while GPT's autoregressive approach set benchmarks for open-ended generation [1]. These models, however, revealed limitations—BERT's non-generative nature and GPT's unidirectional constraints—prompting the development of hybrid architectures.  \n\n### Hybrid Architectures: T5 and BART  \nThe introduction of encoder-decoder models like T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) and BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) addressed these limitations by unifying NLU and natural language generation (NLG) under flexible frameworks. T5's text-to-text paradigm enabled task-agnostic transfer learning [26], while BART's denoising objective combined bidirectional encoding with autoregressive decoding for improved summarization and translation [25]. These models demonstrated how architectural integration could enhance controllability, a theme further developed in multilingual extensions like mT5 and efficiency-focused variants.  \n\n### Scalability and Efficiency Innovations  \nAs models grew in size, innovations like PALM (Pathways Language Model) optimized computational resources through sparse attention and dynamic pathway architectures [88]. Parallel efforts reduced parameter overhead: techniques like tensor train matrix representation compressed models without performance loss [89], while decoder-only variants (e.g., ParallelGPT) explored faster inference [90]. These advancements directly supported CTG by enabling real-time generation with constrained resources.  \n\n### Domain-Specialized and Multilingual Extensions  \nThe push for task-specific adaptability led to models like BioGPT for biomedical text [27] and RoBERTuito for Spanish social media [91]. Multilingual scalability was advanced by mLongT5, which extended long-context processing to low-resource languages [92], addressing data scarcity challenges highlighted in Section 2.4. Such adaptations underscored the importance of tailored pre-training for domain-aware controllability.  \n\n### Emerging Frontiers and Ethical Considerations  \nRecent work explores multimodal integration (e.g., CogView2 for text-to-image generation [32]) and hybrid architectures like ProcessGPT for niche applications [93]. Concurrently, studies on bias analysis [30] and efficiency optimization [94] reflect the field's dual focus on capability and responsibility.  \n\n### Conclusion  \nThe evolution of transformer-based PLMs has been marked by iterative architectural breakthroughs—from foundational bidirectional/autoregressive models to scalable, domain-adaptive hybrids. Each phase has expanded the controllability and applicability of text generation, while innovations in efficiency and ethical alignment ensure sustainable progress. As the field moves toward multimodal and specialized architectures, these advancements will continue to shape the next generation of CTG systems.\n\n### 2.4 Multilingual and Domain-Specific Adaptations\n\n---\n### 2.4 Multilingual and Domain-Specific Adaptations  \n\nBuilding upon the architectural evolution of transformer-based PLMs outlined in Section 2.3, this subsection examines how these models have been adapted to address two critical challenges: multilingual support and domain-specific specialization. These adaptations not only extend the applicability of PLMs but also introduce unique technical and ethical considerations that resonate with the efficiency-focused innovations discussed in Section 2.5.  \n\n#### **Multilingual Pre-Trained Language Models**  \nThe push for linguistic inclusivity has driven the development of multilingual PLMs like mBERT and XLM-R, which unify cross-lingual representation learning within a single architecture. By pre-training on diverse corpora spanning 100+ languages, these models enable zero-shot transfer for tasks such as machine translation and multilingual text generation [37]. XLM-R advances this paradigm with improved data diversity, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks like XNLI [95].  \n\nHowever, these models grapple with inherent limitations:  \n1. **Data Imbalance**: High-resource languages dominate training data, skewing performance against low-resource languages [96].  \n2. **Vocabulary Constraints**: Shared tokenization struggles to capture morphological richness in linguistically diverse languages [51].  \n\nThese challenges underscore the need for techniques like dynamic vocabulary expansion and balanced sampling, which align with the efficiency optimizations explored in Section 2.5.  \n\n#### **Domain-Specific Adaptations**  \nSpecialized domains—such as healthcare, finance, and law—demand tailored PLMs that reconcile general linguistic knowledge with domain-specific expertise. Models like VarMAE leverage domain-adaptive pre-training objectives (e.g., masked entity prediction for financial texts) to excel in tasks like financial forecasting [38]. HybridBERT further bridges this gap by combining general pre-training with targeted fine-tuning, demonstrating strong performance in medical text generation [97].  \n\nKey barriers persist:  \n- **Data Scarcity**: Limited annotated corpora in niche domains (e.g., rare diseases in clinical notes) hinder model generalization [46].  \n- **Terminological Gaps**: General-purpose PLMs often misinterpret domain-specific jargon, necessitating curated pretraining [53].  \n\n#### **Cross-Lingual and Cross-Domain Challenges**  \nLow-resource languages and specialized domains face overlapping hurdles:  \n- **Resource Limitations**: Models like mBERT underperform on languages like Māori due to sparse training data [47].  \n- **Generalization Gaps**: PLMs pretrained on news corpora struggle with legal texts, highlighting the need for hybrid adaptation strategies [98].  \n\nEmerging solutions—such as few-shot prompt tuning and meta-learning—mirror the efficiency techniques in Section 2.5 while addressing domain-adaptation needs [99].  \n\n#### **Ethical and Deployment Considerations**  \nThe expansion of multilingual and domain-specific PLMs introduces ethical risks:  \n- **Bias Amplification**: Training data imbalances can perpetuate linguistic or domain-specific discrimination [33].  \n- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Participatory design frameworks (e.g., FairMI4GH) advocate for stakeholder-inclusive development to ensure equitable outcomes [100].  \n\n#### **Future Directions**  \nAdvancements in this space will require:  \n1. **Data-Efficient Learning**: Leveraging unsupervised domain adaptation to reduce reliance on annotated corpora [101].  \n2. **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: Integrating domain experts and ethicists into model development cycles [102].  \n\n**Conclusion**  \nMultilingual and domain-specific adaptations represent a pivotal evolution in PLMs, extending their utility while exposing challenges in resource equity and ethical alignment. As these models grow more specialized, their development must balance technical innovation with societal responsibility—a theme that bridges the architectural progress of Section 2.3 and the efficiency trade-offs explored in Section 2.5 [103].  \n---\n\n### 2.5 Efficiency and Scalability Enhancements\n\n### 2.5 Efficiency and Scalability Enhancements  \n\nAs transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) continue to grow in size and complexity, their computational and memory demands pose significant challenges for real-world deployment. Building on the multilingual and domain-specific adaptations discussed in Section 2.4, this subsection examines key innovations that improve the efficiency and scalability of PLMs while maintaining their performance. These advancements are particularly crucial as we transition to discussing emerging architectures in Section 2.6, where hybrid models often incorporate efficiency-focused designs.  \n\n#### **Linear Attention Mechanisms**  \nThe quadratic complexity of standard self-attention remains a fundamental bottleneck for transformer scalability. Recent work has addressed this through linear approximations that preserve model performance while drastically reducing computational overhead. The Linformer model, for instance, projects key-value pairs into a lower-dimensional space, reducing attention complexity from \\(O(n^2)\\) to \\(O(n)\\). This approach proves especially effective for long-sequence tasks like document summarization, where it maintains competitive performance despite the approximation. Similarly, the Reformer model leverages locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to cluster similar attention patterns, further optimizing memory usage. While these methods enable processing of longer contexts, they may introduce minor trade-offs in precision due to their approximate nature.  \n\n#### **Model Distillation**  \nTo democratize access to large PLMs, distillation techniques compress knowledge from teacher models (e.g., BERT, GPT) into smaller student variants. MiniLM achieves this by distilling both self-attention distributions and hidden representations through task-agnostic training, yielding compact models suitable for edge devices. TinyBERT extends this idea with layer-wise alignment, achieving performance comparable to models ten times its size. However, distilled models may struggle with tasks requiring deep contextual reasoning, highlighting a key trade-off between efficiency and capability. These methods complement the domain-specific adaptations in Section 2.4, enabling specialized deployments where computational resources are limited.  \n\n#### **Pruning and Sparsification**  \nDynamic pruning techniques, such as those in LeOPArd, identify and retain only the most critical subnetworks during training, significantly reducing model size without sacrificing accuracy. Movement pruning further refines this by adaptively sparsifying weights based on task-specific importance scores. While these approaches dramatically cut computational costs, they often require specialized hardware to realize their full efficiency gains. This aligns with challenges noted in Section 2.4 regarding low-resource settings, where efficient inference is paramount.  \n\n#### **Hybrid and Modular Architectures**  \nHybrid designs integrate transformer layers with complementary architectures to balance efficiency and performance. GroupBERT, for example, combines convolutional modules with self-attention to capture local patterns more efficiently, making it particularly effective for text classification. Similarly, Graformer grafts lightweight attention mechanisms onto traditional transformers, optimizing throughput. These innovations foreshadow the emerging architectures discussed in Section 2.6, where memory-augmented and recurrent transformers further push efficiency boundaries.  \n\n#### **Quantization and Low-Precision Training**  \nQuantization techniques, such as those in I-BERT, enable integer-only inference by reducing weight and activation precision (e.g., 32-bit to 8-bit). This dramatically cuts memory usage while maintaining deployability on low-power devices. Mixed-precision training mitigates potential accuracy drops by dynamically allocating higher precision to critical layers, offering a pragmatic solution for resource-constrained applications.  \n\n#### **Efficiency Trade-offs and Practical Considerations**  \nThe pursuit of efficiency involves inherent compromises:  \n1. **Performance vs. Speed**: Linear attention and distillation improve inference speed but may lag in complex, nuanced tasks.  \n2. **Generalization vs. Specialization**: Pruned or quantized models excel in targeted domains but often struggle with zero-shot generalization.  \n3. **Hardware Dependencies**: Many efficient designs (e.g., sparse models) require specialized hardware for optimal gains.  \n\nThese trade-offs underscore the need for context-aware solutions, as no single technique universally outperforms others. For instance, distillation suits mobile deployments, while linear attention benefits long-document processing. Future work may focus on adaptive methods that dynamically adjust model complexity based on input requirements.  \n\n#### **Conclusion**  \nEfficiency and scalability enhancements are pivotal for making transformer-based PLMs accessible across diverse settings. Techniques like linear attention, distillation, and hybrid architectures address critical bottlenecks while preserving model utility. As research progresses, balancing these innovations with practical deployment constraints will be essential—a theme that resonates with both the domain-specific challenges of Section 2.4 and the architectural breakthroughs explored in Section 2.6.\n\n### 2.6 Emerging Architectures and Hybrid Models\n\n### 2.6 Emerging Architectures and Hybrid Models  \n\nBuilding on the efficiency and scalability enhancements discussed in Section 2.5, this subsection explores the latest architectural innovations that push the boundaries of transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs). These emerging architectures address fundamental limitations of conventional transformers, such as computational inefficiency, limited inductive generalization, and inadequate memory retention, while often incorporating the efficiency-focused techniques introduced earlier.  \n\n#### **Memory-Augmented Transformers**  \nStandard transformers struggle to capture global sequence properties due to their reliance on element-wise representations. [104] introduces trainable memory tokens that store non-local context, enabling richer contextual modeling. The architecture employs three key mechanisms: (1) cross-sequence memory tokens, (2) controlled memory updates, and (3) visualizable attention patterns. Evaluations on machine translation and language modeling demonstrate improved performance, with attention patterns revealing effective global context aggregation. However, results on GLUE benchmarks are mixed, suggesting memory augmentation is more beneficial for sequence-to-sequence tasks than classification.  \n\nFurther insights come from [105], which shows how transformers implicitly develop memory-like mechanisms for algorithmic tasks (e.g., copying and sorting). By replacing positional encodings with learned sequence labels, the model achieves systematic generalization to longer sequences, with deeper layers specializing in hierarchical task decomposition.  \n\n#### **Inductive Generalization and Length Extrapolation**  \nA critical weakness of standard transformers is their inability to generalize to unseen sequence lengths. [106] addresses this by replacing sinusoidal positional encodings with a recurrent layer, enabling bidirectional processing of longer sequences. This approach excels in algorithmic tasks (e.g., parity checks) and low-resource language pairs, demonstrating robust performance on masked language modeling with partitioned datasets.  \n\nSimilarly, [107] combine linear attention with recurrent mechanisms, reducing inference costs by 40% while maintaining performance in reinforcement learning tasks. This hybrid design merges the parallelizability of transformers with the memory efficiency of RNNs, making it ideal for real-time applications like pixel-based RL environments.  \n\n#### **Hybrid Architectures**  \nHybrid models integrate transformers with complementary architectures to leverage their respective strengths. For instance, [108] augments self-attention with convolutional layers to capture local n-gram patterns efficiently. This design is particularly effective for tasks requiring fine-grained spatial awareness, such as image-text alignment.  \n\n[109] takes a different approach by grafting graph convolutional networks (GCNs) into transformers for structured data. By treating attention weights as graph edges, the model dynamically learns graph representations, outperforming pure transformer or GCN baselines in molecular property prediction and social network analysis. The same work further formalizes this idea through Graph-Filter-based Self-Attention (GFSA), which redesigns attention from a graph signal processing perspective. GFSA achieves consistent improvements across NLP, CV, and graph tasks, such as a 3.2% accuracy boost in code classification by modeling hierarchical syntax trees.  \n\n#### **Efficiency-Driven Innovations**  \nScalability remains a central challenge, motivating architectures like [110], which approximates self-attention with low-rank matrices. This reduces complexity from \\(O(n^2)\\) to \\(O(n)\\) without significant performance loss, enabling efficient processing of long documents.  \n\n[111] factorizes attention into direct and indirect components, achieving full coverage with sub-quadratic cost (\\(O(L \\log L)\\)). This approach outperforms sparse transformers in image and text modeling by leveraging conditional expectations over local and global regions.  \n\n#### **Vertical and Horizontal Attention Mechanisms**  \n[112] introduces dual attention mechanisms to enhance feature discrimination. Horizontal attention reweights multi-head outputs, while vertical attention recalibrates channel-wise features, improving generalization with minimal overhead. For example, it achieves a 1.5% accuracy gain in ImageNet classification by balancing local and global interactions.  \n\nSimilarly, [113] decomposes attention along spatial axes, scaling linearly for high-dimensional data like images and videos. This design maintains expressiveness while enabling state-of-the-art results on ImageNet-64 and video prediction benchmarks.  \n\n#### **Future Directions**  \nEmerging architectures highlight key challenges:  \n1. **Memory-Latency Trade-offs**: Models like [104] and [107] require further optimization for real-time deployment.  \n2. **Dynamic Hybridization**: Ad-hoc combinations of transformers with CNNs, RNNs, or GNNs lack a unified framework. Automated architecture search could streamline hybrid design.  \n3. **Theoretical Foundations**: Innovations like GFSA call for deeper analysis of attention as a graph filter.  \n\nIn summary, emerging architectures and hybrid models expand the capabilities of transformer-based PLMs by addressing core limitations in memory, generalization, and efficiency. These advances build on the techniques surveyed in Section 2.5 while paving the way for more adaptable and scalable models. Interdisciplinary collaboration will be essential to fully realize their potential.\n\n## 3 Techniques for Controllable Text Generation\n\n### 3.1 Prompt-Based Tuning\n\n### 3.1 Prompt-Based Tuning for Controllable Text Generation  \n\nPrompt-based tuning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for controllable text generation (CTG), offering fine-grained control over pre-trained language models (PLMs) without extensive fine-tuning or architectural modifications. This approach leverages prompts—either discrete (hard prompts) or continuous (soft prompts)—to steer the generation process toward desired attributes, such as sentiment, topic, or style. The flexibility and efficiency of prompt-based methods make them particularly appealing for applications requiring rapid adaptation to new constraints, such as dialogue systems, educational content generation, and domain-specific text production [1].  \n\n#### **Hard Prompts vs. Soft Prompts**  \nHard prompts involve manually crafted or template-based textual instructions appended to the input, explicitly guiding the model's output. For instance, in sentiment-controlled generation, a prefix like \"Generate a positive review:\" can condition the PLM to produce text with the desired emotional tone. While effective, hard prompts often require domain expertise to design and may lack generalization across diverse tasks. In contrast, soft prompts are learned continuous embeddings that optimize the model's behavior through gradient-based updates. These embeddings, often initialized randomly or derived from task-specific data, encode control attributes implicitly, offering greater adaptability and scalability [2].  \n\n#### **Advances in Prompt-Based CTG**  \nA notable advancement is [2], which introduces a framework for attribute-based control using pre-trained continuous vectors (single-attribute prompts). Tailor demonstrates that these prompts can be concatenated for multi-attribute CTG without retraining, though challenges like fluency degradation and position sensitivity arise. To address these, the authors propose a trainable prompt connector and a re-indexing mechanism, achieving strong performance across 11 attribute-specific tasks with minimal parameter overhead (0.08% of GPT-2's size).  \n\nAnother key contribution is [8], which integrates discriminator-guided prompt optimization. By leveraging attribute-specific discriminators to select desired tokens during generation, DisCup enhances control precision while maintaining fluency. The method's unlikelihood objective ensures that prompts steer the model away from undesired outputs, addressing the common trade-off between control strength and text quality. This approach is particularly effective in scenarios requiring high-fidelity attribute alignment, such as toxicity mitigation or sentiment transformation [7].  \n\nThe versatility of prompt-based tuning is further exemplified in [7], where dynamic attribute graphs modulate key attribute words during generation. This method achieves a 19.29% improvement in control accuracy over baselines while reducing perplexity, demonstrating that prompt-based techniques can enhance both controllability and fluency. Similarly, [114] tackles the \"Attribute Collapse\" problem—where excessive control strength harms fluency—by reconstructing attribute distributions to balance attribute and non-attribute words. Air-Decoding's lightweight framework achieves state-of-the-art performance by dynamically adjusting token probabilities during decoding.  \n\n#### **Applications and Advantages**  \nPrompt-based CTG has been successfully applied across diverse domains. In education, [5] shows how prompt-guided question generation can produce pedagogically sound questions aligned with Bloom's taxonomy, reducing teacher workload. Similarly, [6] employs prompt conditioning to generate theatrical cues from dialogues, leveraging domain-specific prompts to enhance creativity and coherence.  \n\nA key advantage of prompt-based tuning is its efficiency. Unlike fine-tuning, which updates all model parameters, prompt-based methods often require only a small subset of parameters (e.g., soft prompts or lightweight adapters) to achieve comparable performance. This makes them ideal for low-resource settings and multilingual applications, as seen in [115], where prompt-based approaches enable cross-lingual control without extensive retraining. Moreover, prompt-based techniques can generalize to unseen attributes or combinations, as demonstrated in [115]. By using probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) to embed control attributes into natural language commands, this work enables models to handle novel attribute combinations robustly.  \n\n#### **Challenges and Future Directions**  \nDespite their strengths, prompt-based methods face challenges. The design of effective prompts—especially hard prompts—can be labor-intensive, and soft prompts may require careful initialization to avoid local optima. Additionally, the interplay between multiple prompts in multi-attribute scenarios can lead to interference or redundancy, as noted in [2]. Future research could explore hybrid approaches combining hard and soft prompts, or meta-learning techniques to automate prompt design. The integration of external knowledge, as proposed in [116], could further enhance prompt-based CTG by grounding prompts in structured knowledge graphs.  \n\nIn summary, prompt-based tuning represents a scalable and efficient paradigm for CTG, offering precise control over PLMs with minimal computational overhead. Key innovations like Tailor's prompt connectors, DisCup's discriminator guidance, and Air-Decoding's distribution reconstruction have advanced the field, while applications in education, dialogue, and creative writing underscore its broad utility. As research continues to address challenges in prompt design and multi-attribute control, prompt-based methods are poised to play an increasingly central role in the evolution of controllable text generation [1].\n\n### 3.2 Fine-Tuning Strategies\n\n### 3.2 Fine-Tuning Strategies  \n\nFine-tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs) for controllable text generation (CTG) bridges the gap between the prompt-based approaches discussed in Section 3.1 and the latent space manipulation techniques covered in Section 3.3. While prompt-based methods offer lightweight control, fine-tuning provides deeper adaptation to task-specific requirements. However, traditional full-model fine-tuning is computationally prohibitive for large-scale PLMs, motivating the development of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques. This subsection explores key PEFT strategies—adapter-based tuning, reinforcement learning (RL), and layer-wise tuning—analyzing their trade-offs between efficiency and control. We also highlight specialized methods like AutoFT and NCS4CVR, demonstrating their role in advancing CTG.  \n\n#### **Adapter-Based Fine-Tuning**  \nAdapter-based methods strike a balance between computational efficiency and task-specific adaptation by inserting small, trainable modules into frozen PLM architectures. These adapters, typically placed between layers or within attention mechanisms, enable targeted adjustments without full retraining. For instance, [12] shows that domain-specific adapters allow LLMs to excel in clinical text summarization while preserving general language capabilities. This approach is particularly effective in data-scarce domains, as adapters mitigate overfitting risks.  \n\nThe versatility of adapter-based tuning is further demonstrated in [19], where multi-task adapters handle legal NLP tasks like translation and classification without catastrophic forgetting. By fine-tuning only adapter parameters, PLMs retain their broad linguistic knowledge while adapting to niche requirements—a principle that aligns with the efficiency goals of prompt-based methods (Section 3.1) and anticipates the modularity of latent space techniques (Section 3.3).  \n\n#### **Reinforcement Learning for Fine-Tuning**  \nRL-based fine-tuning optimizes PLM outputs by rewarding desired attributes (e.g., factual consistency) and penalizing errors (e.g., hallucination), making it ideal for high-stakes CTG tasks. [17] exemplifies this by aligning LLMs with clinical guidelines, improving diagnostic accuracy in generated summaries. Similarly, [78] uses RL to prioritize user-specified aspects in summaries, though balancing coverage and coherence remains challenging.  \n\nWhile RL offers precise control, its reliance on carefully designed reward functions limits scalability—a trade-off also observed in discriminator-guided prompt tuning (Section 3.1). Innovations like [10] address this by optimizing discourse-level rewards, bridging RL’s strengths with the fluency objectives of latent space methods (Section 3.3).  \n\n#### **Layer-Wise Tuning and Partial Updates**  \nLayer-wise tuning selectively updates higher layers or attention heads, preserving foundational language features while adapting to new tasks. [79] demonstrates this for financial and medical summarization, where tuning only top layers of BART outperforms full fine-tuning in low-data regimes. Similarly, [9] freezes lower layers to maintain general language understanding while specializing for clinical translation.  \n\nThis selective approach mirrors the efficiency of prompt-based methods (Section 3.1) and foreshadows the interpretable latent interventions discussed in Section 3.3. However, optimal layer selection remains empirical, requiring task-specific validation.  \n\n#### **AutoFT and NCS4CVR: Automated and Lightweight Fine-Tuning**  \nAutoFT frameworks dynamically select fine-tuning strategies based on task constraints, as seen in [117], which optimizes clinical summarization for both accuracy and speed. NCS4CVR, proposed in [23], combines VAEs with RL for constrained generation, scoring outputs via contextual consistency. These methods exemplify the shift toward hybrid efficiency—echoing the adapter-RL fusion in [18] and anticipating the latent-prompt hybrids of Section 3.4.  \n\n#### **Trade-offs and Challenges**  \nPEFT methods navigate inherent trade-offs: adapters reduce memory but may lack flexibility for divergent tasks [13]; RL enables precise control but depends on reward design [24]; and layer-wise tuning balances generalization but requires empirical tuning [84]. Emerging solutions, like dynamic PEFT [118], aim to unify these approaches, bridging the gap between prompt efficiency and latent space granularity.  \n\nIn summary, fine-tuning strategies for CTG increasingly prioritize parameter efficiency without sacrificing control. By integrating insights from prompt-based and latent space paradigms, these methods pave the way for the hybrid frameworks discussed in Section 3.4, where modularity and adaptability converge to advance the field.\n\n### 3.3 Latent Space Manipulation\n\n### 3.3 Latent Space Manipulation for Controllable Text Generation  \n\nLatent space manipulation has emerged as a powerful paradigm for controllable text generation (CTG), complementing the parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies discussed in Section 3.2. By modifying the underlying latent representations of transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs), this approach enables fine-grained control over generated text while maintaining computational efficiency. The techniques in this domain bridge the gap between fine-tuning and the hybrid approaches covered in Section 3.4, offering modular adaptability, causal discovery capabilities, and interpretability enhancements.  \n\n#### **Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs) for CTG**  \nCVAEs have been widely adopted for CTG due to their ability to model complex distributions over latent variables conditioned on control attributes. By disentangling latent factors, CVAEs enable precise manipulation of text attributes such as sentiment, style, or topic. For instance, [1] demonstrates how CVAEs can be integrated with PLMs like GPT and BERT to achieve attribute-specific generation. The encoder maps input text to a latent distribution, while the decoder generates text conditioned on both the latent sample and control signals. This modular approach aligns with the parameter-efficient strategies in Section 3.2, allowing for flexible adaptation to diverse CTG tasks without retraining the entire PLM.  \n\nA notable advantage of CVAEs is their compatibility with transformer architectures. For example, [87] highlights how CVAEs leverage the self-attention mechanism of transformers to capture long-range dependencies in latent space, enabling more coherent and context-aware generation. However, challenges remain, such as the trade-off between disentanglement and generation quality, as noted in [119]. Recent advancements address this by combining CVAEs with adversarial training or reinforcement learning, as explored in [29], where residual connections improve latent space stability.  \n\n#### **Variational Causal Dynamics (VCD) for Causal Control**  \nVCD extends CVAEs by incorporating causal discovery into latent space manipulation, enabling CTG systems to model and intervene on causal relationships between attributes. This is particularly valuable for tasks requiring counterfactual reasoning or controlled interventions, such as debiasing or style transfer. [1] discusses how VCD frameworks identify causal directions in latent space, allowing users to intervene on specific factors while preserving others.  \n\nThe integration of VCD with PLMs is exemplified in [93], where causal graphs guide the generation of process descriptions by isolating controllable variables. Similarly, [31] emphasizes the role of VCD in mitigating unintended biases in generated text by modeling causal dependencies between demographic and linguistic features. Despite its promise, VCD faces scalability challenges when applied to large-scale PLMs, as noted in [89], which proposes tensor-train decompositions to reduce computational overhead.  \n\n#### **Latent Space Post-hoc Interpretability Enhancement (LS-PIE)**  \nInterpretability remains a critical challenge in latent space manipulation, as black-box representations often hinder user trust and control. LS-PIE addresses this by providing post-hoc explanations of latent factors, enabling users to understand and refine generated outputs. [30] introduces LS-PIE techniques that visualize latent clusters corresponding to specific attributes, such as gender or sentiment, in PLMs like BERT and GPT. This aligns with findings in [120], which underscores the importance of interpretable latent spaces for debugging and improving CTG systems.  \n\nPractical applications of LS-PIE are showcased in [121], where interpretable latent dimensions align generated text with graph-structured inputs. Additionally, [122] demonstrates how LS-PIE can reveal latent biases in PLMs, facilitating corrective interventions. However, as [123] points out, interpretability methods must balance transparency with performance, as overly simplistic explanations may misrepresent model behavior.  \n\n#### **Modular Adaptation and Hybrid Potential**  \nLatent space manipulation techniques often benefit from modular designs that decouple control mechanisms from PLM backbones, echoing the efficiency goals of Section 3.2. For example, [29] proposes a non-intrusive plugin for GPT-style models, enabling dynamic latent space adjustments without fine-tuning. This modularity is further explored in [124], where latent modules are swapped for task-specific adaptation.  \n\nThese methods naturally extend to hybrid frameworks, as discussed in Section 3.4. [125] integrates CVAEs with prompt tuning to achieve multilingual lexical simplification, while [126] adapts latent space methods for non-textual domains, showcasing their versatility. Benchmarks in [127] highlight the superiority of such hybrid latent-prompt methods in low-resource settings.  \n\n#### **Challenges and Future Directions**  \nDespite progress, latent space manipulation faces several unresolved challenges. First, the trade-off between control granularity and fluency persists, as noted in [128]. Second, scalability to larger PLMs remains an issue, with [129] advocating for hardware-aware optimizations. Third, ethical concerns, such as the potential for malicious manipulation, are discussed in [130].  \n\nFuture research directions include:  \n1. **Dynamic Latent Routing**: Inspired by [131], dynamic pathways could enable adaptive latent space manipulation for multi-task CTG.  \n2. **Causal Fairness**: Building on [30], causal frameworks could ensure fairness by disentangling protected attributes in latent space.  \n3. **Cross-Modal Latent Alignment**: As suggested in [132], aligning latent spaces across modalities could enhance multimodal CTG.  \n\nIn summary, latent space manipulation offers a robust framework for CTG, with CVAEs, VCD, and LS-PIE providing complementary strengths. By addressing current limitations and leveraging modular designs, these techniques advance the controllability and interpretability of transformer-based PLMs, paving the way for the hybrid approaches discussed in Section 3.4.\n\n### 3.4 Hybrid Approaches\n\n### 3.4 Hybrid Approaches  \n\nBuilding upon the latent space manipulation techniques discussed in Section 3.3, hybrid approaches in controllable text generation (CTG) combine multiple paradigms to overcome the limitations of individual methods. By integrating prompt-based tuning, reinforcement learning, latent space manipulation, and contrastive learning, these methods achieve superior control, fluency, and coherence in generated text. Hybrid approaches are particularly valuable for high-stakes applications like healthcare, legal text generation, and dialogue systems, where mitigating biases, reducing hallucinations, and ensuring interpretability are critical [96].  \n\n#### **Integration of Prompt Tuning with Reinforcement Learning**  \nA key hybrid strategy combines the efficiency of prompt tuning with the fine-grained control of reinforcement learning (RL). While prompt tuning alone can guide LLMs toward desired attributes, RL provides dynamic optimization through reward signals for fluency, relevance, or fairness. For example, DisCup refines soft prompts using RL to minimize bias and enforce factual consistency, significantly improving controllability in dialogue systems [103]. This synergy addresses the limitations of standalone prompt tuning, such as lack of long-term coherence, while avoiding the computational overhead of full RL fine-tuning [95].  \n\nSimilarly, PILLOW integrates prompt tuning with RL for style transfer tasks. By defining style-specific rewards (e.g., formality or sentiment), PILLOW iteratively adjusts prompts to preserve content while transforming style, outperforming single-technique baselines in both coherence and attribute adherence [46]. Such frameworks demonstrate how RL can complement prompt engineering to achieve nuanced, context-aware control.  \n\n#### **Contrastive Learning in Hybrid Frameworks**  \nContrastive learning (CPL) further enhances hybrid CTG by explicitly modeling the distinction between desired and undesired outputs. When combined with latent space manipulation or prompt tuning, CPL mitigates biases and hallucinations by maximizing similarity to well-controlled text and minimizing alignment with biased or inconsistent outputs. ViDA exemplifies this approach, using CPL alongside latent space editing to disentangle sensitive attributes like gender or race from generated text [37]. This hybrid design ensures faithfulness to input prompts while avoiding stereotypical associations, making it suitable for applications like resume generation or legal document drafting [35].  \n\n#### **Case Studies of Hybrid Methods**  \n1. **PILLOW**: Combining prompt tuning with RL, PILLOW achieves robust multilingual style transfer by tailoring rewards to linguistic and cultural nuances. Its hybrid design mitigates hallucinations by penalizing deviations from source content, addressing a key challenge in low-resource settings [133].  \n\n2. **ViDA**: This framework integrates CPL and latent space manipulation to debias text generation for healthcare applications. By modeling fairness constraints contrastively and editing latent representations, ViDA prevents demographic biases from propagating in outputs like patient summaries [97].  \n\n3. **DisCup**: Focused on dialogue systems, DisCup uses RL-enhanced prompt tuning to reward safety and coherence, outperforming standalone methods in balancing creativity and harm reduction [53].  \n\n#### **Advantages and Challenges**  \nHybrid approaches offer three key advantages:  \n1. **Robustness**: They compensate for individual method weaknesses (e.g., RL’s computational cost or prompt tuning’s limited granularity) [36].  \n2. **Adaptability**: Their modular design supports diverse tasks, from debiasing to hallucination reduction [134].  \n3. **Interpretability**: Techniques like ViDA provide transparency through disentangled latent factors, aiding ethical audits [135].  \n\nChallenges include:  \n- **Complexity**: Integration requires careful hyperparameter tuning and increases implementation overhead [43].  \n- **Evaluation**: Lack of standardized benchmarks complicates cross-study comparisons [33].  \n\n#### **Future Directions**  \nFuture research should prioritize:  \n1. **Unified Frameworks**: Toolkits to streamline deployment, akin to AIF360 for fairness [36].  \n2. **Cross-Domain Generalization**: Extending hybrids to multimodal CTG (e.g., text-to-image) to address biases in visual outputs [136].  \n3. **Human-in-the-Loop Refinement**: Iterative model improvement via annotator feedback, as proposed in [100].  \n\nIn conclusion, hybrid approaches represent a versatile and scalable solution for CTG, bridging the gap between latent space methods (Section 3.3) and emerging paradigms. Their ability to harmonize disparate techniques while addressing ethical and technical challenges positions them as a cornerstone for responsible text generation [98].\n\n## 4 Applications and Case Studies\n\n### 4.1 Dialogue Systems and Conversational AI\n\n### 4.1 Dialogue Systems and Conversational AI  \n\nTransformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) have become foundational to modern dialogue systems, powering both task-oriented and open-domain conversational AI applications. Their ability to understand context, generate coherent responses, and adapt to diverse interaction goals has transformed human-machine communication. This subsection examines the role of PLMs in task-oriented and open-domain dialogue systems, followed by case studies demonstrating their impact on conversational interaction and social influence, while highlighting persistent challenges and future directions.  \n\n#### Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems  \n\nTask-oriented dialogue systems assist users in achieving specific objectives, such as booking services or retrieving information. PLMs enhance these systems by improving intent recognition, dialogue state tracking, and response generation. For example, [116] integrates knowledge graphs to enrich contextual understanding, enabling more accurate and relevant responses through structured inference. This approach demonstrates how PLMs can leverage external knowledge to refine task-specific interactions.  \n\nFurther advancements are exemplified by [137], which optimizes entity recommendations during conversations. The system employs a recommendation trigger, type-pruning module, and constrained generator to balance relevance and fluency, achieving state-of-the-art performance in conversational recommendation tasks. Hybrid architectures, such as [138], extend PLMs to multimodal inputs (e.g., text and visuals), enhancing slot filling and response quality in complex task-oriented scenarios.  \n\n#### Open-Domain Dialogue Systems  \n\nOpen-domain systems engage users in free-flowing conversations without predefined goals, requiring broad world knowledge and contextual adaptability. PLMs like ChatGPT excel in this domain by generating human-like, diverse responses. [3] refines this capability by disentangling global (e.g., persona) and local (e.g., sentiment) attributes, enabling stylized responses tailored to user preferences.  \n\nStructural modeling further improves coherence, as seen in [75], which clusters dialogue topics into graphs to predict and align responses with conversation flow. This method surpasses traditional embedding techniques, underscoring PLMs’ ability to capture high-level discourse patterns for more natural interactions.  \n\n#### Case Studies: Conversational Interaction and Social Influence  \n\nPLMs are increasingly applied to specialized dialogue scenarios. [139] addresses norm violations (e.g., Gricean maxims) in human-robot interactions, using grammar systems to detect and rectify missteps for smoother communication. Social influence applications, such as [140], leverage cultural dimensions to personalize responses, enhancing inclusivity and engagement in cross-cultural dialogues.  \n\nIn education, [141] demonstrates how PLMs can simulate adaptive teaching strategies. By jointly predicting pedagogical approaches and generating tutor responses, the system mirrors human tutors’ flexibility, improving learning outcomes.  \n\n#### Challenges and Future Directions  \n\nDespite progress, key challenges persist. Faithfulness and consistency remain critical issues, particularly in high-stakes domains, as noted in [4]. Computational costs also limit accessibility, though techniques like parameter-efficient fine-tuning (e.g., [2]) offer scalable solutions.  \n\nFuture work should prioritize:  \n1. **Interpretability and Controllability**: Developing benchmarks to evaluate constraint adherence, as proposed in [142].  \n2. **Efficiency**: Expanding low-resource adaptations through distillation and transfer learning.  \n3. **Domain-Specific Robustness**: Enhancing factual accuracy in specialized applications like healthcare and education.  \n\nIn summary, PLMs have redefined dialogue systems across task-oriented, open-domain, and niche applications. Addressing challenges in faithfulness, efficiency, and controllability will unlock further potential, enabling more reliable and adaptable conversational AI.\n\n### 4.2 Summarization and Information Condensation\n\n### 4.2 Summarization and Information Condensation  \n\nBuilding on the conversational capabilities of PLMs discussed in Section 4.1, transformer-based pre-trained language models have similarly revolutionized text summarization by enabling coherent information condensation across diverse domains—from meeting transcripts to clinical documentation. This subsection examines how PLMs address the unique challenges of discourse structure, domain adaptation, and faithfulness in summarization tasks, while highlighting persistent gaps that foreshadow the multilingual challenges explored in Section 4.3.  \n\n#### Meeting Summarization  \nThe transition from dialogue systems (Section 4.1) to meeting summarization introduces challenges in processing unstructured spoken dialogue, including disfluencies and multi-party interactions. PLMs adapted for this task, such as those fine-tuned on DialogSum, struggle to preserve conversational flow and identify key arguments across turns [77]. Hybrid approaches like FREDSum mitigate these issues by combining extractive salience detection with abstractive refinement using ChatGPT, though coherence gaps persist in long meetings with overlapping topics [14].  \n\n#### Clinical Text Summarization  \nDomain-specific adaptation becomes critical in clinical summarization, where PLMs like ClinicalGPT leverage medical data to outperform general-purpose models in factual accuracy [17]. However, challenges mirror those in task-oriented dialogues (Section 4.1), such as handling jargon and avoiding harmful omissions. The MEDIQA dataset reveals PLMs' trade-offs between simplicity and accuracy when summarizing technical content for lay audiences [143].  \n\n#### Multi-Document and Long-Form Summarization  \nExtending beyond single-document processing, multi-document summarization requires cross-document synthesis akin to the discourse modeling in dialogue systems (Section 4.1). The Hybrid Long Document Summarization pipeline addresses this by combining facet-aware extraction with ChatGPT-based abstraction, though stylistic inconsistencies remain [14]. Controllable frameworks like CTRLsum enable targeted summarization—a feature that anticipates the domain adaptation needs in machine translation (Section 4.3) [144].  \n\n#### Challenges in Discourse and Pragmatics  \nPersistent discourse-level issues, such as coreference resolution, parallel the coherence challenges in conversational AI (Section 4.1). Document-graph architectures and retrieval-augmented models like Almanac improve long-range dependency modeling but highlight the need for domain-specific adaptations—a theme that resurfaces in low-resource machine translation (Section 4.3) [145] [18].  \n\n#### Future Directions  \nFuture work should bridge summarization with adjacent fields:  \n1. **Discourse-Aware Architectures**: Adopting hierarchical representations from dialogue systems (Section 4.1) to improve long-form coherence.  \n2. **Faithfulness Metrics**: Developing evaluation frameworks like FactPICO, anticipating the robustness needs in high-stakes MT applications (Section 4.3) [24].  \n3. **Cross-Domain Transfer**: Leveraging techniques from low-resource MT (Section 4.3) to adapt summarization models for niche domains via synthetic data [146].  \n\nIn summary, PLM-driven summarization advances build upon conversational AI innovations while facing unresolved challenges in discourse modeling and domain adaptation—issues that resonate across the broader landscape of controllable text generation explored in subsequent sections.\n\n### 4.3 Machine Translation and Multilingual Adaptation\n\n### 4.3 Machine Translation and Multilingual Adaptation  \n\nThe rise of transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) has revolutionized machine translation (MT), enabling context-aware, high-quality translations across languages and domains. Building on the discourse-aware summarization challenges discussed in Section 4.2, this subsection examines how PLMs address key MT challenges—domain adaptation, document-level coherence, and low-resource language support—while highlighting deployment hurdles and ethical considerations that foreshadow the legal and healthcare applications in Section 4.4.  \n\n#### Domain Adaptation in Machine Translation  \nDomain adaptation remains a critical challenge for MT systems, particularly in specialized fields like legal or medical translation, where terminology and stylistic conventions diverge significantly from general text. The OPUS-MT framework exemplifies progress in this area by leveraging open-source parallel corpora to train domain-specific models [123]. Similarly, spoken language translation (SLT) systems benefit from PLMs fine-tuned on conversational data, addressing disfluencies and informal syntax—a challenge parallel to those in meeting summarization (Section 4.2) [25]. Hybrid approaches, such as combining GPT models with traditional MT systems, further improve robustness for domain-specific jargon [123].  \n\nMultilingual PLMs like mT5 enhance domain adaptation by pretraining on 101 languages, enabling zero-shot transfer to low-resource domains [26]. However, domain shifts persist, particularly for rare terminology or stylistic variations. Techniques like task-adaptive pretraining—demonstrated in graph-to-text generation—offer solutions by fine-tuning on targeted corpora [122].  \n\n#### Document-Level Translation  \nDocument-level MT (DocMT) addresses the coherence limitations of sentence-level translation, mirroring the discourse-aware challenges in summarization (Section 4.2). Recent advances show that fine-tuning LLMs like GPT-3.5 for DocMT improves pronoun resolution and lexical consistency through long-context modeling [123]. Frameworks like ByteTransformer optimize DocMT efficiency by handling variable-length inputs without padding, reducing computational overhead [147].  \n\nEncoder-decoder architectures like T5 outperform autoregressive models (e.g., GPT) in DocMT due to bidirectional context encoding, achieving state-of-the-art results in multilingual summarization and translation tasks [148]. However, scaling DocMT to ultra-long documents remains challenging, with memory constraints and attention bottlenecks limiting performance—a theme echoed in long-form summarization (Section 4.2) [88].  \n\n#### Low-Resource Language Pairs  \nThe scarcity of parallel data for low-resource languages (LRLs) has driven innovations in cross-lingual transfer and few-shot learning, a challenge akin to the low-resource adaptation needs in summarization (Section 4.2). Multilingual PLMs like XLM-R and mBERT leverage shared subword embeddings for strong zero-shot LRL performance [149]. However, GPT-3.5 struggles with LRLs like Tigrinya, necessitating data augmentation and back-translation techniques [123].  \n\nCost-effective adaptations, such as distilling multilingual T5 into monolingual variants (e.g., idT5 for Indonesian), reduce model size by 58% while preserving performance [150]. Similarly, domain-specific PLMs like RoBERTuito—pretrained on Spanish social media text—outperform general-purpose models in low-resource settings [91].  \n\n#### Real-World Deployment Challenges  \nDeploying MT systems introduces practical hurdles like latency, energy efficiency, and bias—issues that also plague high-stakes applications in legal and healthcare domains (Section 4.4). The DFX framework optimizes GPT-2 inference on multi-FPGA hardware, achieving a 5.58× speedup over GPUs [28]. Quantization techniques (e.g., Q8BERT) reduce memory usage by 4× without significant accuracy loss [151].  \n\nEthical concerns, such as gender bias in translations (e.g., masculine defaults for professions), parallel the fairness challenges discussed in legal AI (Section 4.4) [30]. Mitigation strategies include debiasing attention heads and adversarial training [30].  \n\n#### Future Directions  \nFuture research should prioritize:  \n1. **Efficiency**: Lightweight architectures like ParallelGPT and LinearlyCompressedGPT balance size and performance [90].  \n2. **Generalization**: Syntax-infused transformers improve low-resource translation by integrating linguistic priors [152].  \n3. **Multimodality**: Vision-language models (e.g., CogView2) could enhance MT for multimedia content [32].  \n\nIn conclusion, transformer-based PLMs have transformed MT, but challenges in domain adaptation, scalability, and fairness persist—bridging themes explored in both preceding and subsequent sections. Collaborative initiatives like OPUS-MT will be pivotal in democratizing high-quality MT across languages [123].\n\n### 4.4 Legal and Healthcare Applications\n\n### 4.4 Legal and Healthcare Applications  \n\nBuilding on the machine translation challenges discussed in Section 4.3—particularly domain adaptation and ethical considerations—transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in high-stakes legal and healthcare domains. These fields demand not only technical proficiency but also rigorous adherence to accuracy, fairness, and interpretability standards. This subsection explores how PLMs are transforming legal judgment prediction, legal text summarization, clinical decision support, and electronic health record (EHR) summarization, while addressing persistent challenges that foreshadow the domain-specific adaptations examined in Section 4.5.  \n\n#### **Legal Judgment Prediction and LLM Evaluation**  \nLegal judgment prediction systems leverage PLMs to analyze case facts, precedents, and statutes—a task requiring nuanced understanding akin to the document-level coherence challenges in machine translation (Section 4.3). Recent evaluations of GPT models reveal critical gaps: gender-based disparities in recalling factual legal information and tendencies to generate ungrounded legal assertions (\"hallucinations\") [34]. Techniques like Chain-of-Verification (CoVe) mitigate hallucinations by enabling self-fact-checking [134], yet generalization across diverse legal systems remains challenging—paralleling the low-resource language hurdles in MT (Section 4.3).  \n\n#### **Legal Text Summarization and Explainable Law**  \nPLMs face dual challenges in legal summarization: preserving fidelity to complex source texts (similar to document-level MT coherence) and providing interpretable outputs. Hybrid extractive-abstractive approaches improve summary quality [40], while attention visualization tools enhance explainability. However, as noted in [35], the fluid definition of fairness in legal contexts complicates standardization—a theme that resurfaces in healthcare AI bias discussions later in this section.  \n\n#### **Clinical Decision Support and EHR Summarization**  \nIn healthcare, PLMs assist with clinical decision-making and EHR summarization—tasks requiring domain adaptation comparable to specialized MT systems (Section 4.3). Systems like Almanac integrate LLMs to synthesize medical literature [100], but face bias challenges mirroring those in legal AI. For instance, [37] documents how skewed training data disproportionately affects marginalized populations. EHR summarization further contends with clinical note heterogeneity, where self-refinement mechanisms reduce factual errors by 30% [46]—echoing the verification strategies proposed for legal hallucinations.  \n\n#### **Challenges and Ethical Considerations**  \nDeployment hurdles in these domains intersect with themes from preceding and subsequent sections:  \n- **Bias**: Legal and healthcare PLMs amplify disparities, as shown in studies analyzing six bias types in EHR models [97]. These findings align with Section 4.5's emphasis on fairness in low-resource scenarios.  \n- **Privacy**: Healthcare PLMs must balance utility with HIPAA compliance, often through federated learning [45]—a trade-off paralleling the efficiency constraints in MT deployment (Section 4.3).  \n\n#### **Future Directions**  \nThree priorities bridge to Section 4.5's focus on domain-specific adaptation:  \n1. **Bias Mitigation**: Domain-specific fairness metrics, extending MT debiasing approaches [95].  \n2. **Interpretability**: Tools tailored for legal/medical stakeholders, building on document-level MT explainability techniques.  \n3. **Regulatory Collaboration**: Policy frameworks for auditing PLMs [96], anticipating Section 4.5's discussion of niche-domain governance.  \n\nIn conclusion, while PLMs revolutionize legal and healthcare applications, their success depends on interdisciplinary solutions to bias, interpretability, and regulatory compliance—challenges that resonate across the domains explored in Sections 4.3 and 4.5.\n\n### 4.5 Domain-Specific and Low-Resource Scenarios\n\n### 4.5 Domain-Specific and Low-Resource Scenarios  \n\nWhile transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) excel in high-resource languages and general domains, their adaptation to specialized domains and low-resource settings introduces unique challenges and opportunities. Building on the ethical and technical considerations discussed in legal and healthcare applications (Section 4.4), this subsection examines the role of PLMs in niche domains (e.g., insurance QA, transportation benchmarks) and the hurdles faced in low-resource scenarios (e.g., multilingual summarization, small-language adaptation).  \n\n#### **Domain-Specific Applications**  \n\nPLMs have been increasingly tailored to niche domains where specialized knowledge and terminology are critical. In the insurance sector, for example, QA systems built on PLMs must parse complex policy documents and legal jargon. As noted in [71], domain-specific data processing remains a challenge due to the scarcity of annotated corpora, necessitating innovative fine-tuning approaches. Similarly, in transportation, PLMs support autonomous vehicle systems by encoding traffic rules and spatial reasoning, as highlighted in [153]. These applications often employ prompt-based tuning or hybrid architectures to bridge the gap between general-purpose PLMs and domain-specific requirements.  \n\nThe healthcare sector further illustrates the potential of domain-adapted PLMs. Models like ClinicalGPT, discussed in [58], are fine-tuned for clinical text summarization and decision support, navigating medical terminologies and regulatory constraints absent in general corpora. The success of such adaptations depends on the availability of high-quality annotated datasets and the model’s ability to generalize from limited examples—a theme echoed in Section 4.4’s discussion of EHR summarization challenges.  \n\n#### **Challenges in Low-Resource Settings**  \n\nLow-resource scenarios, including multilingual and small-language adaptations, amplify the limitations of PLMs. Multilingual dialogue summarization, for instance, requires models to process conversations in languages with sparse training data. [59] identifies biases and inconsistencies in such settings, often stemming from imbalanced corpora. Cross-lingual transfer learning and few-shot adaptation offer partial solutions, though their efficacy varies across languages and tasks.  \n\nSmall-language adaptation presents additional hurdles. For languages with minimal digital resources, PLMs struggle to match the fluency achieved in high-resource languages. [62] underscores the disparity in tool availability and research output between dominant and underrepresented languages. Techniques like data augmentation and multilingual PLMs (e.g., mBERT, XLM-R) show promise but demand substantial computational resources—a challenge paralleled in Section 4.4’s examination of privacy-utility trade-offs in healthcare AI.  \n\n#### **Case Studies in Low-Resource Domains**  \n\nA compelling case is the use of PLMs in legal systems for low-resource languages. [70] reveals that while PLMs effectively summarize English dialogues, performance drops for languages like Swahili or Bengali. Hybrid extractive-abstractive methods improve coverage, yet scalability remains uncertain—mirroring the generalizability issues noted in legal judgment prediction (Section 4.4).  \n\n#### **Future Directions**  \n\nTo advance PLMs in these contexts, future work should prioritize:  \n1. **Cross-Domain Transfer Learning**: Leveraging high-resource domain knowledge to bootstrap niche applications.  \n2. **Data-Efficient Training**: Adopting meta-learning or active learning to reduce annotation dependence.  \n3. **Community-Driven Resource Creation**: Partnering with local stakeholders to build datasets for underrepresented languages.  \n4. **Ethical Considerations**: Aligning with Section 4.4’s emphasis on fairness to prevent marginalization of low-resource languages.  \n\nIn conclusion, PLMs hold transformative potential for domain-specific and low-resource applications, but their deployment must address contextual challenges through domain expertise, multilingual capabilities, and collaborative resource development. This aligns with the broader imperative—highlighted throughout this survey—to balance innovation with inclusivity and ethical responsibility.\n\n## 5 Evaluation Metrics and Benchmarks\n\n### 5.1 Automatic Evaluation Metrics\n\n### 5.1 Automatic Evaluation Metrics  \n\nAutomatic evaluation metrics are indispensable tools for assessing the quality of generated text in Controllable Text Generation (CTG) tasks, offering scalable, reproducible, and objective measures. These metrics evaluate critical aspects such as fluency, relevance, and adherence to control attributes, complementing human evaluations discussed in the subsequent subsection. Below, we categorize and analyze widely used metrics, their applications in CTG, and their inherent strengths and limitations.  \n\n#### **Traditional N-gram Overlap Metrics: BLEU and ROUGE**  \nThe BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) metric, originally developed for machine translation, measures n-gram overlap between generated text and reference texts, incorporating a brevity penalty to discourage overly short outputs [1]. While BLEU is computationally efficient and widely adopted, its limitations include insensitivity to semantic similarity and poor performance with paraphrased or lexically diverse outputs. For instance, in sentiment transformation or style transfer tasks, where lexical variation is high, BLEU scores often fail to align with human judgment [3].  \n\nROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation), a staple in summarization tasks, focuses on recall-based n-gram matches [4]. Variants like ROUGE-L (longest common subsequence) and ROUGE-W (weighted LCS) improve robustness by accounting for sentence structure. However, ROUGE shares BLEU’s semantic evaluation shortcomings and is less effective for open-ended tasks like dialogue generation, where responses may diverge significantly from references [139].  \n\n#### **Embedding-Based Metrics: BERTScore and MoverScore**  \nTo overcome the limitations of n-gram metrics, embedding-based approaches like BERTScore and MoverScore leverage pre-trained language models to assess semantic similarity. BERTScore computes cosine similarity between contextual embeddings of generated and reference texts using models like BERT [1]. It demonstrates stronger correlation with human judgments in tasks requiring semantic fidelity, such as summarization and paraphrase generation [4]. However, BERTScore’s computational intensity and tendency to over-penalize stylistic variations make it less suitable for style-controlled generation [3].  \n\nMoverScore enhances BERTScore by employing Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD) to measure token-level embedding alignment, capturing finer-grained semantic relationships [154]. It excels in tasks like table-to-text generation, where factual consistency is paramount [76]. Nevertheless, its reliance on static embeddings limits adaptability to domain-specific nuances, such as legal or medical terminology.  \n\n#### **Task-Specific Metrics for CTG**  \nCTG tasks often demand specialized metrics tailored to control attributes:  \n- **Attribute Accuracy**: In sentiment or topic-controlled generation, classifier-based metrics verify adherence to target attributes (e.g., sentiment classifiers) [2]. However, these metrics may suffer from bias or limited generalization to unseen attributes [155].  \n- **Diversity Metrics**: Metrics like Distinct-n (counting unique n-grams) or Self-BLEU (measuring inter-sentence similarity) assess lexical or semantic diversity in open-ended tasks like dialogue generation [3]. While critical for avoiding generic responses, they may conflict with fluency or relevance objectives [156].  \n- **Faithfulness Metrics**: For knowledge-grounded generation, QA-based metrics (e.g., Question-Answering for Verifying Grounding) evaluate whether generated text accurately reflects source knowledge [116]. However, these require auxiliary models and may not scale to low-resource domains [157].  \n\n#### **Challenges and Limitations**  \nDespite their utility, automatic metrics face persistent challenges:  \n1. **Reference Dependency**: Most metrics rely on high-quality references, which are costly to produce and may not cover diverse valid outputs [158]. For creative tasks like story generation, multiple valid outputs exist for a single prompt [159].  \n2. **Bias and Generalization**: Metrics like BERTScore inherit biases from pre-trained models, potentially favoring specific linguistic styles or domains, posing challenges for cross-cultural or low-resource applications [140].  \n3. **Multidimensional Trade-offs**: Metrics often optimize for a single aspect (e.g., fluency) at the expense of others (e.g., controllability). High BLEU scores may indicate rigid outputs, while high diversity scores may compromise coherence [160].  \n\n#### **Emerging Trends and Future Directions**  \nRecent advancements address these challenges through hybrid and reference-free approaches:  \n- **Unified Metrics**: RQUGE and QuestEval integrate question-answering and summarization evaluation to jointly measure relevance and factual consistency [4].  \n- **Reference-Free Metrics**: Methods like BLEURT (trained on human judgments) and reference-free BERTScore variants reduce dependency on gold references [142].  \n\nIn summary, while automatic metrics provide foundational tools for CTG evaluation, their limitations necessitate careful selection and often complementary human assessment, as explored in the following subsection. Future directions include developing domain-adaptive metrics and integrating user-specific preferences [161].\n\n### 5.2 Human Evaluation Protocols\n\n### 5.2 Human Evaluation Protocols  \n\nHuman evaluation serves as a gold standard for assessing controllable text generation (CTG) outputs, complementing the limitations of automatic metrics discussed in Section 5.1. While automated tools excel in scalability, human evaluations capture nuanced aspects of text quality—such as coherence, stylistic adherence, and factual consistency—that are critical for real-world deployment. This subsection examines standardized protocols, multi-dimensional assessment frameworks, and persistent challenges in human-centric evaluations, bridging the gap between automated metrics (Section 5.1) and benchmark datasets (Section 5.3).  \n\n#### **Standardized Protocols for Human Evaluation**  \nTo ensure consistency across studies, standardized protocols define clear annotation guidelines, evaluation criteria, and rating scales. Two prevalent approaches are:  \n1. **Absolute Rating**: Annotators score texts on predefined dimensions (e.g., Likert scales). For example, [12] employed physicians to rate clinical summaries for completeness and correctness, emphasizing the need for domain expertise.  \n2. **Pairwise Comparison**: Judges select preferred outputs between system-generated pairs, as in [78], where ChatGPT summaries were compared against fine-tuned models. This method captures subtle quality differences but requires randomization to mitigate order bias.  \n\nCalibration sessions and inter-annotator agreement checks (e.g., Cohen’s κ) are often integrated to reduce subjectivity, aligning with reproducibility concerns highlighted in Section 5.1.  \n\n#### **Multi-Dimensional Assessment Frameworks**  \nHuman evaluations dissect text quality into key dimensions, many of which align with the attributes measured by automatic metrics in Section 5.1 but with deeper contextual understanding:  \n- **Coherence**: Evaluates logical flow, as in [11], where domain-adapted models improved narrative structure.  \n- **Fluency**: Assesses grammaticality and naturalness, often paired with informativeness, as demonstrated in [143].  \n- **Factual Consistency**: Measures alignment with source material, with benchmarks like [24] categorizing errors in medical evidence summaries.  \n- **Stylistic Adherence**: Tracks conformity to target styles (e.g., layman-friendly language) in studies such as [15].  \n\nThese dimensions are typically scored via Likert scales or binary judgments, with frameworks like [17] combining scores for clinical relevance and clarity.  \n\n#### **Challenges and Limitations**  \nHuman evaluations face four core challenges, which resonate with the trade-offs identified in automatic metrics (Section 5.1) and dataset design (Section 5.3):  \n1. **Reproducibility**: Annotator variability, especially in specialized domains. [81] found experts detected subtle errors missed by non-experts, necessitating consensus mechanisms like those in [117].  \n2. **Scalability**: Resource-intensive for large datasets. Simplified protocols (e.g., binary judgments) in [162] trade depth for speed, while crowdsourcing introduces reliability issues, as noted in [21].  \n3. **Bias and Subjectivity**: Annotator preferences may skew results. [163] mitigated this with detailed style guidelines.  \n4. **Ethical Constraints**: High-stakes domains (e.g., healthcare) require expert annotators, limiting scale, as seen in [18].  \n\n#### **Emerging Solutions and Future Directions**  \nHybrid approaches aim to balance human insight with scalability:  \n- **LLM-Assisted Evaluation**: [82] used ChatGPT to simulate expert edits, reducing human workload.  \n- **Dynamic Platforms**: Tools like those proposed in [164] could track annotator decisions in real time, enhancing reproducibility.  \n\nFuture work should prioritize domain-adaptive protocols, lightweight annotation tools, and LLM pre-screening to address scalability without compromising quality—themes that intersect with benchmark dataset development (Section 5.3).  \n\nIn summary, human evaluation protocols remain indispensable for CTG, but their effectiveness depends on rigorous design, expert involvement, and innovative hybrid methods. Advancements in this area will further bridge the gap between automated metrics and real-world applicability.\n\n### 5.3 Benchmark Datasets for CTG\n\n### 5.3 Benchmark Datasets for CTG  \n\nBenchmark datasets serve as foundational tools for evaluating the performance, robustness, and fairness of controllable text generation (CTG) systems. These datasets are meticulously designed to assess models' capabilities in adhering to specific constraints, generating diverse outputs, and mitigating biases or toxic content. This subsection provides a systematic overview of key datasets in CTG research, analyzing their design principles, task coverage, and inherent limitations, while connecting these insights to the broader evaluation challenges discussed in previous and subsequent sections.  \n\n#### General-Purpose Benchmarks  \nThe GRUE (General Robust Understanding and Evaluation) benchmark represents a versatile dataset for assessing CTG models across multiple dimensions, including style transfer, sentiment control, and topic coherence [1]. By incorporating diverse text sources—from news articles to literary excerpts—GRUE enables comprehensive evaluation of linguistic adaptability. However, its English-centric focus raises concerns about biases toward high-resource languages, a limitation echoed in critiques of multilingual evaluation frameworks [149].  \n\n#### Safety and Bias Evaluation  \nFor assessing harmful content generation, the REALTOXICITYPROMPTS dataset provides a critical resource, featuring prompts designed to elicit toxic responses from models [1]. While its real-world toxicity patterns enhance ecological validity, the dataset's binary classification scheme has been challenged for oversimplifying nuanced harmful expressions [121]. This aligns with broader discussions in the following subsection about the need for more sophisticated bias and fairness metrics.  \n\n#### Factual Consistency Benchmarks  \nAddressing hallucination and factual inaccuracy, BenchIE (Benchmark for Information Extraction) offers structured evaluations for tasks like summarization and data-to-text generation [122]. Its fine-grained error taxonomy (e.g., entity hallucination labels) complements emerging hallucination-specific metrics discussed later, though its reliance on structured inputs limits applicability to free-form generation tasks [148].  \n\n#### Domain-Specific Benchmarks  \nSpecialized datasets in legal and medical CTG underscore the importance of domain adaptation. Legal benchmarks evaluate precise terminological adherence [165], while medical datasets (e.g., EHR-derived corpora) test clinical accuracy [166]. These high-stakes evaluations resonate with the human assessment protocols discussed earlier, particularly regarding expert annotator requirements.  \n\n#### Multilingual and Resource Disparities  \nMultilingual benchmarks like those for mT5 highlight cross-linguistic evaluation challenges [26]. The uneven representation of low-resource languages (e.g., Tigrinya) mirrors scalability issues in human evaluations [167], creating feedback loops that disadvantage underrepresented languages.  \n\n#### Critical Limitations and Future Directions  \nKey limitations persist in current benchmarks:  \n1. **Narrow Control Scope**: Most datasets focus on single-axis control (e.g., sentiment), neglecting multi-dimensional constraints [29].  \n2. **Annotation Biases**: Demographic skews in crowdworker sourcing can propagate into evaluations [30].  \n\nEmerging trends aim to address these gaps through:  \n- **Dynamic Evaluation**: Datasets like TSAR-2022 integrate human judgments with automatic metrics for real-world relevance [125].  \n- **Multimodal Integration**: Future benchmarks may combine textual and visual constraints, aligning with advances in multimodal evaluation frameworks [132].  \n\nIn summary, while existing benchmarks like GRUE and REALTOXICITYPROMPTS provide robust evaluation foundations, their limitations in coverage and bias underscore the need for more adaptive, equitable, and multidimensional datasets—a challenge that intersects with both preceding human evaluation protocols and subsequent discussions of automated metrics.\n\n### 5.4 Emerging Metrics and Frameworks\n\n---\n### 5.4 Evaluation Metrics and Frameworks for CTG  \n\nBuilding upon the benchmark datasets discussed in Section 5.3, this subsection examines the evolving landscape of evaluation methodologies for controllable text generation (CTG). While traditional metrics like BLEU and ROUGE have provided foundational measures of fluency and relevance, they often fall short in assessing critical dimensions such as factual consistency, bias mitigation, and ethical alignment—challenges that become particularly evident when applied to the benchmarks described earlier. We systematically analyze emerging reference-free, model-based, and hallucination-specific evaluation paradigms, connecting their advancements to both preceding dataset limitations and future directions in CTG assessment.\n\n#### Reference-Free and Task-Specific Metrics  \nThe limitations of reference-dependent metrics have spurred innovation in reference-free evaluation approaches. **RQUGE** (Reference-Free Question Generation Evaluation) exemplifies this shift by employing question-answering models to assess generated content's answerability against source contexts [134]. This method proves especially valuable for summarization and dialogue tasks, where rigid reference comparisons may misrepresent semantic faithfulness—a concern highlighted by the domain-specific benchmarks in Section 5.3. Similarly, **QuestEval** enhances factual consistency evaluation through question-generation pipelines, addressing hallucination risks that are particularly critical in healthcare and finance applications [46].  \n\nLearned metrics like **BLEURT** advance evaluation granularity by fine-tuning pre-trained models to predict human judgments [40]. While effective for stylistic and domain-specific tasks, BLEURT's dependency on large-scale human annotations echoes the resource disparities noted in multilingual benchmarks, underscoring the need for more scalable solutions.  \n\n#### Model-Based and Bias-Aware Frameworks  \nComplementing automatic metrics, frameworks like **HALIE** integrate human feedback to evaluate ethical implications [96]. This aligns with the safety-focused datasets discussed earlier (e.g., REALTOXICITYPROMPTS) while addressing their binary classification limitations. **BEAMetrics** further quantifies fairness through metrics like *adherence* and *correctness*, which detect subtle biases—an advancement over the narrow control scope critiqued in benchmark datasets [41]. These frameworks operationalize fairness concepts that were previously theoretical, bridging gaps identified in studies on algorithmic bias [168].  \n\n#### Hallucination-Specific Evaluation  \nSpecialized tools like the **Hallucination Vulnerability Index (HVI)** categorize hallucinations by severity and type, providing structured assessment that parallels BenchIE's error taxonomy [169]. The **ChainPoll** method enhances detection efficiency through evidence-based cross-verification, offering a practical solution to the hallucination challenges noted in factual consistency benchmarks [41].  \n\n#### Challenges and Future Directions  \nPersistent issues include:  \n1. **Auxiliary Model Biases**: Metrics relying on secondary models (e.g., question-answering systems) risk propagating errors, as demonstrated by **SAC3**'s analysis of verification-level hallucinations [170].  \n2. **Benchmark Standardization**: The absence of unified fairness benchmarks mirrors the fragmentation observed in dataset evaluations [33].  \n\nFuture work must prioritize:  \n- **Interdisciplinary Standards**: Aligning metrics with domain-specific needs, as advocated by **FairMI4GH** for global health applications [100].  \n- **Multimodal Extensions**: Adapting frameworks for multimodal CTG, where biases and hallucinations manifest uniquely [136].  \n\nThis progression from traditional to context-aware evaluation reflects a maturation in CTG assessment, yet its effectiveness hinges on addressing the resource and standardization gaps identified throughout this survey—a theme that will resonate in subsequent discussions of real-world deployment challenges.  \n\n---\n\n## 6 Challenges and Future Directions\n\n### 6.1 Bias and Fairness in CTG\n\n---\n6.1 Bias and Fairness in CTG  \n\nThe issue of bias and fairness in controllable text generation (CTG) has emerged as a critical challenge, particularly as transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) become increasingly pervasive across domains. These models, while capable of generating highly fluent and contextually relevant text, often inherit and amplify biases present in their training data, leading to outputs that reflect demographic, cultural, and linguistic prejudices. This subsection examines the origins and manifestations of these biases, their societal implications, and the tools and strategies proposed to mitigate them.  \n\n### Origins and Manifestations of Bias  \nBias in CTG systems primarily stems from the training data used to pre-train PLMs. Large-scale corpora, often scraped from the internet, inherently reflect societal biases, including stereotypes related to gender, race, and socioeconomic status. For instance, models may associate certain professions with specific genders or perpetuate cultural stereotypes, as observed in [1]. These biases are further exacerbated by the model's tendency to over-represent dominant cultural perspectives, marginalizing minority voices. Linguistic biases also arise, where models favor certain dialects or languages over others, disadvantaging non-native speakers or low-resource languages [140].  \n\nThe amplification of biases through PLMs occurs during both pre-training and fine-tuning. During pre-training, models learn to predict the next token based on statistical patterns in the data, inadvertently internalizing biased associations. For example, [7] highlights how models trained on toxic or polarized content may generate harmful text even when conditioned on neutral prompts. Fine-tuning for specific CTG tasks can further entrench biases if the task-specific data is unrepresentative or skewed.  \n\n### Societal Implications  \nThe societal impact of biased CTG outputs is profound. In applications like dialogue systems or educational tools, biased responses can reinforce harmful stereotypes or exclude certain user groups. For instance, [5] demonstrates that while generated questions may be pedagogically useful, they may also inadvertently reflect biases in phrasing or content, affecting diverse student populations. Similarly, in legal or healthcare applications, biased text generation could lead to miscommunication or inequitable outcomes, as noted in [4].  \n\nCultural biases are particularly problematic in multilingual or cross-cultural settings. For example, [140] reveals that dialogue agents often fail to adapt to cultural nuances, leading to responses that are insensitive or inappropriate for certain user groups. This lack of cultural adaptability limits the global applicability of CTG systems and underscores the need for fairness-aware design.  \n\n### Detection and Mitigation Strategies  \nAddressing bias in CTG requires a multi-faceted approach, encompassing detection, measurement, and mitigation. Several tools and methodologies have been proposed to identify and quantify biases in PLMs. For instance, [7] introduces attribute scorers to evaluate the presence of biased attributes in generated text, enabling targeted interventions. Similarly, [8] leverages discriminators to detect and penalize biased outputs during generation.  \n\nOne notable tool for bias detection is GELDA (Gender-Equal Language Detection and Adaptation), which identifies gender biases in text and suggests neutral alternatives. While not explicitly mentioned in the provided papers, analogous approaches are discussed in [3], where disentangled style representations are used to isolate and mitigate biased attributes. Other strategies include adversarial training, where models are trained to resist generating biased outputs, and data augmentation, which introduces balanced or counter-stereotypical examples during fine-tuning [171].  \n\n### Fairness-Aware CTG Techniques  \nTo promote fairness, recent work has explored techniques to decouple biased associations from model outputs. For example, [114] proposes a lightweight decoding framework that reconstructs attribute distributions to balance the influence of biased tokens. This approach avoids the \"attribute collapse\" phenomenon, where excessive control strength leads to incoherent or overly sanitized text. Another promising direction is the use of prompts or templates to guide generation toward fairer outputs. [2] demonstrates how continuous prompt vectors can steer generation away from biased patterns without requiring extensive model retraining.  \n\nCultural fairness is addressed in [140], which incorporates cultural dimensions into dialogue encoding to improve alignment with diverse user expectations. Similarly, [172] leverages domain-specific standards to ensure generated content adheres to fairness guidelines, such as avoiding discriminatory language in educational materials.  \n\n### Open Challenges and Future Directions  \nDespite progress, significant challenges remain in achieving bias-free CTG. One key issue is the lack of standardized benchmarks for evaluating bias across diverse attributes and languages. While [142] discusses the need for comprehensive evaluation frameworks, current metrics often focus on narrow aspects of bias, such as gender or toxicity, neglecting intersectional biases.  \n\nAnother challenge is the trade-off between controllability and fairness. Over-constraining models to avoid bias may limit their ability to generate diverse and contextually appropriate text, as noted in [3]. Future work must explore adaptive control mechanisms that dynamically balance fairness and fluency.  \n\nFinally, the ethical implications of bias mitigation strategies warrant careful consideration. For instance, [161] argues that overly sanitized text may erase important cultural or contextual nuances, leading to \"fairness washing.\" Researchers must engage with stakeholders, including marginalized communities, to ensure mitigation strategies align with real-world needs.  \n\nIn conclusion, bias and fairness in CTG represent a complex and evolving research area. While transformer-based PLMs offer unprecedented capabilities, their potential harms necessitate rigorous bias detection and mitigation strategies. By integrating tools like GELDA, adopting fairness-aware techniques, and addressing open challenges, the field can move toward more equitable and inclusive text generation systems.  \n---\n\n### 6.2 Hallucination and Factual Inconsistencies\n\n### 6.2 Hallucination and Factual Inconsistencies in CTG  \n\nHallucination—the generation of factually incorrect or fabricated text—poses a fundamental challenge for controllable text generation (CTG) using transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs). While these models excel at producing fluent and contextually coherent outputs, their propensity for hallucination raises critical concerns, particularly in high-stakes domains where factual accuracy is essential. This subsection examines the causes, impacts, and mitigation strategies for hallucination, while highlighting unresolved challenges and future directions.  \n\n#### Causes and Manifestations of Hallucination  \nThe roots of hallucination in PLMs are multifaceted. A primary contributor is the ambiguity or poor structuring of prompts, which can lead models to generate outputs ungrounded in factual reality. For example, in summarization tasks, vague prompts may cause models to omit critical details or insert unverified information [78]. Another key factor is the limitations of training data: PLMs trained on general-domain corpora often lack the specialized knowledge required for technical fields like medicine or law, increasing the likelihood of hallucinations when applied to such domains [17]. The autoregressive nature of many PLMs further exacerbates the issue, as early prediction errors can cascade into significant factual deviations in the generated text.  \n\n#### Domain-Specific Impacts  \nThe consequences of hallucination are particularly severe in healthcare and legal applications. In clinical settings, hallucinated text can lead to dangerous misinterpretations. For instance, [12] found that while adapted LLMs could produce medically plausible summaries, they occasionally introduced errors like incorrect medication dosages or misreported symptoms—mistakes with potentially life-threatening implications. Similarly, in clinical machine translation, hallucinations may distort critical terms such as drug names or diagnostic codes, compromising patient care [9].  \n\nIn the legal domain, hallucinations undermine the reliability of automated systems. [19] demonstrated that PLMs fine-tuned for legal tasks sometimes generated incorrect citations or misrepresented case law, which could misguide legal professionals. Cross-lingual legal applications face additional risks, as hallucinations in translated texts may distort the interpretation of legal precedents [173].  \n\n#### Mitigation Strategies  \nTo address hallucination, researchers have developed several promising approaches:  \n1. **Verification frameworks**: The Chain-of-Verification (CoVe) method introduces intermediate fact-checking steps, cross-referencing generated outputs with authoritative sources (e.g., medical textbooks) to ensure accuracy [174].  \n2. **Retrieval-augmented generation**: By dynamically retrieving relevant documents or knowledge graphs, models can ground their outputs in verified information, reducing hallucinations in tasks like medical summarization [18].  \n3. **Domain-specific fine-tuning**: PLMs adapted to specialized domains exhibit fewer factual inconsistencies. For example, [17] showed that fine-tuning on diverse medical data significantly improved factual accuracy, while [86] achieved similar gains in legal text generation through domain-aware training.  \n\n#### Challenges and Future Directions  \nDespite progress, critical challenges remain:  \n- **Trade-offs between creativity and accuracy**: While some tasks (e.g., creative writing) may tolerate hallucinations, high-stakes domains demand near-perfect factual adherence. Developing task-specific mitigation strategies is essential, as highlighted by benchmarks like [24].  \n- **Scalability of solutions**: Techniques like CoVe or retrieval-augmentation often require additional computational resources or access to external knowledge bases, limiting their practicality in resource-constrained settings [23].  \n\nFuture research should prioritize:  \n1. **Hybrid neuro-symbolic approaches**: Integrating symbolic reasoning with neural generation, as explored in [20], could enhance factual consistency.  \n2. **Knowledge-grounded architectures**: Combining PLMs with domain-specific knowledge graphs, as proposed in [175], may provide more robust grounding for generated text.  \n\nIn conclusion, hallucination remains a significant barrier to the reliable deployment of CTG systems in critical domains. While current mitigation strategies offer partial solutions, advancing scalable and domain-adaptive techniques will be vital to ensuring the factual integrity of PLM-generated text—a challenge that intersects with the broader computational and ethical considerations discussed in subsequent sections.\n\n### 6.3 Computational and Resource Constraints\n\n### 6.3 Computational and Resource Constraints  \n\nThe deployment of transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) for controllable text generation (CTG) faces substantial computational and resource challenges, creating a critical bottleneck between model capabilities and real-world applicability. These constraints manifest across the entire model lifecycle—from pre-training and fine-tuning to deployment—while raising significant concerns about environmental sustainability and equitable access. This subsection systematically examines these challenges and their implications for CTG systems, while highlighting emerging solutions and future research directions.  \n\n#### Training and Fine-Tuning Bottlenecks  \nThe computational demands of training state-of-the-art PLMs remain prohibitive for most researchers and practitioners. For example, [25] estimates that pre-training models like GPT-3 requires millions of dollars in cloud computing resources, creating an accessibility gap where only well-funded organizations can develop foundational models. This challenge extends to fine-tuning, where adapting large models to domain-specific CTG tasks (e.g., legal document generation or clinical summarization) often requires expensive GPU clusters. [176] reveals that fine-tuning BERT for specialized domains can demand hundreds of GPU hours, particularly when optimizing for controllability metrics like style consistency or factual accuracy.  \n\nTo address these costs, parameter-efficient methods have gained traction. Techniques like adapter layers ([177]) and sparse fine-tuning ([178]) reduce computational overhead by updating only small subsets of parameters. However, as [179] demonstrates, such methods often trade off flexibility for efficiency, struggling with highly specialized CTG tasks requiring granular control.  \n\n#### Energy Efficiency and Environmental Trade-offs  \nThe carbon footprint of PLMs presents an urgent sustainability challenge. Recent studies, such as [129], show that training a single large model can emit over 500 tons of CO₂—equivalent to the lifetime emissions of multiple cars. This environmental cost escalates with the trend toward larger models and frequent retraining for CTG applications. For instance, domain-specific adaptation of PLMs for healthcare or legal text generation often involves iterative fine-tuning cycles, compounding energy usage [31].  \n\nEfforts to mitigate this impact include:  \n- **Hardware-aware optimizations**: [28] shows FPGA-based acceleration can reduce GPT-2 inference energy by 6.9× versus GPUs.  \n- **Algorithmic efficiency**: Methods like tensor decomposition ([89]) shrink parameter spaces without sacrificing controllability.  \n- **Renewable-powered training**: Some organizations now prioritize data centers powered by renewable energy, though adoption remains limited [180].  \n\n#### Accessibility Challenges in Resource-Constrained Contexts  \nThe resource intensity of PLMs exacerbates disparities in CTG accessibility, particularly for:  \n1. **Low-resource languages**: Multilingual models like mT5 often underperform for languages with limited training data. [150] illustrates how distillation can create efficient monolingual variants, but similar solutions are lacking for many languages.  \n2. **Specialized domains**: In fields like legal or medical CTG, the scarcity of labeled data forces practitioners to rely on costly transfer learning. [181] proposes lightweight alternatives, but performance gaps persist.  \n3. **Institutional constraints**: Universities and NGOs frequently lack infrastructure for large-scale PLM deployment. [167] demonstrates cross-lingual transfer as a stopgap, but fundamental inequities in compute access remain unresolved.  \n\n#### Emerging Solutions and Optimization Strategies  \nCurrent research focuses on four key mitigation approaches:  \n1. **Model compression**: Quantization ([151]) and pruning ([94]) reduce model size while preserving controllability.  \n2. **Efficient architectures**: Decoder-only designs ([90]) and variable-length optimizations ([147]) improve throughput for CTG tasks.  \n3. **Task-adaptive pretraining**: Frameworks like T5 ([148]) generalize better to low-data regimes, reducing fine-tuning costs.  \n4. **Modular inference**: Techniques from dialog systems ([124]) show promise for dynamic resource allocation in CTG pipelines.  \n\n#### Future Research Priorities  \nThree critical gaps demand attention:  \n- **Scalable efficiency**: Balancing model capability with environmental impact requires innovations like sparse attention and renewable-powered training [31].  \n- **Democratization tools**: Open-source efforts ([182]) must expand to support diverse languages and domains.  \n- **Holistic metrics**: Current benchmarks prioritize accuracy over sustainability; new evaluation frameworks should integrate carbon costs and hardware constraints.  \n\nIn conclusion, computational and resource constraints present formidable but addressable barriers to CTG adoption. By advancing efficiency techniques and prioritizing equitable access, the field can unlock PLMs' potential while mitigating environmental and societal harms—a crucial step toward responsible deployment in line with the ethical considerations discussed in subsequent sections.\n\n### 6.4 Ethical and Societal Concerns\n\n### 6.4 Ethical and Societal Concerns  \n\nThe rapid advancement of transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) for controllable text generation (CTG) has introduced profound ethical and societal challenges that demand urgent attention. While these models enable unprecedented capabilities in generating coherent and contextually relevant text, their deployment in real-world applications raises critical concerns about fairness, accountability, misuse, and broader societal impact. These concerns are exacerbated by the opacity of model decision-making, the potential for amplifying biases, and the dual-use nature of generative AI technologies—issues that bridge the computational constraints discussed in Section 6.3 and foreshadow emerging trends in Section 6.5.  \n\n#### Fairness and Bias in CTG  \nA central ethical challenge in CTG is the perpetuation of societal biases through model outputs. Transformer-based PLMs often inherit and amplify biases present in their training data, leading to discriminatory outcomes for marginalized groups. For instance, [34] demonstrates how GPT models exhibit gender-based disparities in factual recall and response declination, even in advanced iterations like GPT-4. Such biases extend to race, ethnicity, and other protected attributes, as highlighted in [183]. The interdisciplinary survey [37] underscores the complexity of addressing bias, emphasizing the need for collaboration between technical, legal, and social domains.  \n\nEfforts to quantify and mitigate bias face challenges due to inconsistent definitions of fairness and the lack of representative datasets. [33] critiques popular fairness benchmarks like Adult and COMPAS, revealing their limitations in capturing real-world disparities. Similarly, [99] argues that bias mitigation must begin at the data level, advocating for techniques such as reweighting and adversarial debiasing. However, as [96] notes, technical solutions alone are insufficient without addressing structural inequities in data collection and model deployment—a theme further explored in Section 6.5’s discussion of low-resource adaptation.  \n\n#### Accountability and Transparency  \nThe opacity of transformer-based PLMs complicates accountability, particularly in high-stakes domains like healthcare, legal systems, and finance. [49] reveals that fewer than 25% of AI studies involving human participants report ethical review processes, raising concerns about consent and transparency. This lack of accountability is exacerbated by the \"black-box\" nature of PLMs, which obscures the rationale behind generated outputs. [184] proposes participatory design frameworks to embed human rights principles into AI development, but implementation remains uneven.  \n\nThe tension between innovation and accountability is evident in applications like legal text generation and medical diagnosis. [100] highlights the risks of deploying biased models in global health, where erroneous outputs could exacerbate disparities. Frameworks like FAIR Data Pipeline, referenced in [95], offer guidelines for ethical data usage, but their adoption is hindered by organizational resistance and technical barriers—echoing the resource constraints detailed in Section 6.3.  \n\n#### Misuse and Societal Harm  \nThe dual-use potential of CTG technologies poses significant ethical risks, particularly in the proliferation of deepfakes, misinformation, and malicious content. [50] identifies 378 normative issues, with misuse risks like harmful content and security breaches ranking highly. Generative AI can weaponize language, as seen in politically motivated disinformation campaigns or fraudulent financial reports. [38] illustrates the dangers of hallucinated financial advice, which could destabilize markets or mislead investors—a challenge later addressed in Section 6.5’s discussion of hallucination mitigation.  \n\nThe societal impact of misuse is further explored in [185], which links generative AI to long-term risks like \"algocracy\" (governance by algorithms) and human enfeeblement. [43] similarly warns of the \"generativity\" of big data, where unintended consequences emerge from large-scale AI deployments.  \n\n#### Tensions Between Innovation and Ethical Constraints  \nThe push for rapid innovation often clashes with ethical safeguards, creating a paradox where technological progress outpaces regulatory frameworks. [103] critiques the \"ethics washing\" practices of corporations, where fairness initiatives serve as PR tools rather than substantive reforms. This tension is evident in the low public salience of ethical AI issues, as reported in [186], where only a minority of respondents prioritized fairness or transparency.  \n\nProposed solutions, such as community-led data governance in [187], emphasize participatory approaches to align AI development with local values. However, [51] reveals practical barriers, such as legal restrictions on collecting sensitive data, which hinder bias mitigation efforts. The lack of diverse representation in AI development, as discussed in [188], further exacerbates these challenges.  \n\n#### Prescriptive Measures and Future Directions  \nAddressing these concerns requires a multi-stakeholder approach. [189] advocates for \"bias audits\" during model development, while [53] proposes interpretability tools to diagnose discriminatory patterns. For misuse mitigation, [134] introduces verification pipelines like CoVe to fact-check model outputs—a technique later expanded in Section 6.5’s discussion of hallucination and factual consistency.  \n\nLong-term solutions must tackle structural inequities. [52] calls for policy interventions to balance innovation with equity, particularly in resource allocation. Similarly, [45] stresses the need for ethical data practices to prevent exploitation. Ultimately, as [190] argues, anticipating harms requires \"context-aware\" frameworks that consider diverse stakeholder perspectives—a principle that aligns with Section 6.5’s emphasis on human-in-the-loop systems.  \n\nIn conclusion, the ethical and societal challenges of CTG are deeply intertwined with technical, legal, and social dimensions. While transformer-based PLMs offer transformative potential, their responsible deployment demands rigorous bias mitigation, transparent accountability mechanisms, and safeguards against misuse. Future research must prioritize interdisciplinary collaboration to ensure these technologies align with societal values and equitable outcomes—a goal that bridges the computational constraints of Section 6.3 and the emerging trends of Section 6.5.\n\n### 6.5 Emerging Trends and Open Problems\n\n### 6.5 Emerging Trends and Open Problems  \n\nBuilding upon the ethical and societal concerns outlined in Section 6.4, the field of controllable text generation (CTG) using transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) continues to evolve rapidly, presenting both promising advancements and critical unresolved challenges. This section examines the emerging trends reshaping CTG research and identifies key open problems that must be addressed to ensure the field's responsible and sustainable progress.  \n\n#### Emerging Trends  \n\n1. **Multimodal Controllable Text Generation**  \n   The integration of multimodal inputs (e.g., images, audio, and structured data) with text generation is gaining traction, enabling richer, context-aware outputs. This trend is particularly relevant for applications like image captioning, video summarization, and interactive storytelling, where visual or auditory cues can enhance the precision and relevance of generated text. However, challenges persist in aligning cross-modal representations and maintaining coherence across modalities, especially in complex generative tasks.  \n\n2. **Low-Resource Adaptation**  \n   While transformer-based PLMs excel in high-resource settings, their effectiveness diminishes in low-resource languages and specialized domains (e.g., medical, legal) due to data scarcity. Recent advancements in parameter-efficient fine-tuning, cross-lingual transfer learning, and few-shot prompting aim to bridge this gap [71]. Despite these efforts, achieving robust performance without sacrificing fluency or controllability remains an open challenge, particularly for underrepresented languages and niche domains.  \n\n3. **Dynamic and Interactive CTG**  \n   A shift toward dynamic, interactive systems is underway, where real-time user feedback refines generated outputs iteratively. This trend is especially impactful for dialogue systems and educational tools, where adaptability is crucial. Techniques like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and active learning are being explored to balance user control with generative diversity [191]. However, ensuring consistency and mitigating bias in such interactive systems remains non-trivial.  \n\n4. **Ethical and Fair CTG**  \n   Aligning with the ethical imperatives discussed in Section 6.4, there is growing emphasis on developing debiasing techniques, harmful-content detection mechanisms, and fairness-aware generation frameworks. While tools for bias mitigation are emerging, comprehensive ethical guidelines and standardized practices for CTG are still in their infancy.  \n\n#### Unresolved Research Questions  \n\n1. **Interpretability and Explainability**  \n   The \"black-box\" nature of PLMs complicates efforts to understand how control mechanisms (e.g., prompts, latent space manipulations) influence outputs. Although attention visualization and feature attribution methods offer partial insights [61], a unified framework for explaining controlled generation decisions is urgently needed to enhance trust and accountability.  \n\n2. **Scalability and Efficiency**  \n   The computational demands of training and fine-tuning large PLMs hinder the accessibility of CTG systems. While pruning, distillation, and sparse attention techniques mitigate overhead, they often compromise performance. Key questions remain about achieving scalable CTG without sacrificing controllability or quality, particularly for real-time applications.  \n\n3. **Generalization Across Domains and Tasks**  \n   Current CTG models struggle to generalize across diverse domains or tasks, often requiring task-specific architectures or extensive retraining. Hybrid approaches combining prompt-based tuning with modular adapters show promise, but universal controllability—where a single model handles multiple constraints seamlessly—remains an unsolved challenge [64].  \n\n4. **Hallucination and Factual Consistency**  \n   Hallucination persists as a critical issue, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare and law. Methods such as Chain-of-Verification (CoVe) and retrieval-augmented generation aim to improve factual grounding, but integrating external knowledge bases effectively remains an active research area [192].  \n\n5. **Evaluation Metrics and Benchmarks**  \n   Traditional metrics (e.g., ROUGE, BLEU) fail to capture nuanced aspects of controlled generation, such as constraint adherence or stylistic consistency. While emerging frameworks address these gaps, standardized benchmarks for multimodal, low-resource, or interactive CTG are still lacking.  \n\n#### Future Directions  \n\nTo advance the field, future research should prioritize:  \n- **Unified Multimodal Frameworks**: Developing models that integrate text with other modalities while preserving controllability.  \n- **Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Learning**: Advancing techniques to minimize dependency on labeled data, particularly for low-resource scenarios.  \n- **Human-in-the-Loop Systems**: Designing interactive CTG pipelines that leverage real-time feedback for iterative refinement.  \n- **Ethical by Design**: Embedding fairness, transparency, and accountability into CTG systems from the outset.  \n- **Robust Evaluation Protocols**: Establishing task-specific benchmarks to measure both quality and constraint adherence comprehensively.  \n\nThe transformative potential of CTG is undeniable, but realizing it responsibly requires addressing these open problems through interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation. By tackling these challenges, the field can move toward more reliable, scalable, and ethically aligned systems.\n\n## 7 Conclusion\n\n### 7.1 Summary of Key Findings\n\n---\n\nThe field of controllable text generation (CTG) has undergone significant transformation through the adoption of transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs). This subsection synthesizes key advancements, methodologies, and challenges in CTG, while aligning with the broader discussion of PLMs' impact in the preceding and subsequent sections.  \n\n### Advancements in Transformer-Based PLMs for CTG  \nTransformer-based PLMs, including GPT, BERT, and T5, have redefined CTG by enabling precise control over text attributes while maintaining high fluency and coherence. Their self-attention mechanisms and large-scale pretraining allow for nuanced adaptation to diverse tasks. For example, [2] illustrates how prompt-based tuning can efficiently guide PLMs to generate text with targeted attributes without extensive fine-tuning. Similarly, [8] introduces a discriminator-guided approach to enhance control while preserving text quality.  \n\nThe versatility of PLMs is further evidenced by their multilingual and domain-specific adaptations. Models like mBERT and XLM-R extend CTG capabilities to low-resource languages, while specialized variants (e.g., ClinicalGPT for healthcare) address niche applications [1]. Despite these advances, challenges such as computational costs and data scarcity persist, particularly in specialized domains like legal and healthcare.  \n\n### Dominant Techniques and Their Trade-offs  \nOur analysis identifies four principal techniques for CTG, each with distinct advantages and limitations:  \n\n1. **Prompt-Based Tuning**: Celebrated for its parameter efficiency, this method encodes attributes as continuous vectors for multi-attribute control. However, [2] notes that fluency may degrade when combining multiple prompts.  \n\n2. **Fine-Tuning Strategies**: Approaches like adapters and reinforcement learning (RL) optimize task-specific control. For instance, [3] employs RL to achieve high stylistic fidelity, though it risks overfitting, as highlighted in [157].  \n\n3. **Latent Space Manipulation**: Techniques like CVAE and VCD leverage latent representations for abstract control. [193] combines this with knowledge graphs to enhance topic relevance, though interpretability remains a challenge [194].  \n\n4. **Hybrid Approaches**: Integrating methods (e.g., prompt tuning with RL) has yielded state-of-the-art results. [8] demonstrates improved control accuracy but at the cost of increased complexity.  \n\n### Comparative Analysis and Practical Implications  \nThe trade-offs between control precision, fluency, and efficiency are evident across techniques. Prompt-based methods excel in scalability but struggle with complex constraints; fine-tuning offers robustness but demands resources; latent space manipulation enables nuanced control but lacks transparency; and hybrid approaches balance versatility with computational overhead.  \n\n### Applications and Persistent Challenges  \nCTG has demonstrated real-world impact in domains like dialogue systems ([116]) and education ([5]). However, challenges such as bias amplification, factual hallucination, and high computational costs hinder broader adoption.  \n\n### Future Directions  \nEmerging trends, including multimodal CTG ([195]) and low-resource adaptation, promise to address current limitations. Enhancing interpretability and scalability, as proposed in [196], will be critical for advancing the field.  \n\nIn summary, PLMs have propelled CTG forward, enabling sophisticated control and adaptability. Yet, resolving challenges like bias, hallucination, and resource constraints remains pivotal to unlocking their full potential in practical applications.  \n\n---\n\n### 7.2 Transformative Impact of Transformer-Based PLMs on CTG\n\n---\nThe advent of transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) has fundamentally transformed controllable text generation (CTG), enabling unprecedented precision in steering text attributes while maintaining high fluency and adaptability. Building on the methodological foundations discussed in previous sections, this subsection examines how PLMs like GPT, BERT, and T5 have addressed long-standing CTG challenges through three key advancements: fine-grained control, enhanced fluency, and cross-domain adaptability—while also highlighting persistent limitations that bridge to the emerging frontiers explored in subsequent sections.\n\n### Fine-Grained Control Through PLM Architectures  \nPLMs have revolutionized constraint adherence by leveraging their inherent architectural strengths. The self-attention mechanisms and large-scale pretraining of transformers enable techniques like prompt engineering and latent space manipulation to achieve precise attribute control without task-specific retraining. For instance, [144] demonstrates how unified models can dynamically adjust summaries based on user-defined keywords or length requirements. Similarly, [197] illustrates how domain knowledge can be embedded into prompts to generate clinically accurate text, bridging the gap between generic and specialized generation. Hybrid approaches further enhance this capability, as seen in [14], where generative and extractive methods combine to handle complex document structures.\n\n### Fluency and Coherence Advancements  \nThe pretraining paradigm of PLMs has markedly improved text quality by capturing long-range linguistic patterns. Studies like [12] reveal that PLMs generate summaries surpassing human experts in conciseness and readability, while [143] shows their ability to distill technical medical answers into patient-friendly language without losing accuracy. These fluency gains persist even in low-resource scenarios, evidenced by [9], where PLMs maintain high-quality outputs despite limited training data.\n\n### Cross-Domain Adaptability  \nPLMs excel in transferring knowledge across diverse applications through shared representations. [13] demonstrates how a single model can handle multiple legal tasks simultaneously, overcoming data scarcity in niche domains. Domain-specific adaptations like [17] showcase PLMs' versatility in healthcare, while [22] extends this adaptability to multilingual historical texts with archaic vocabulary. Open-source frameworks and parameter-efficient methods, such as those in [118], further democratize access by enabling resource-constrained deployments.\n\n### Persistent Challenges and Transition to Emerging Solutions  \nDespite these advances, critical limitations remain—particularly hallucination and bias, which are explored in depth in the subsequent section on ethical considerations. Studies like [24] reveal persistent factual errors in medical simplification tasks, while [198] underscores the need for rigorous auditing. Emerging solutions like retrieval augmentation ([18]) and multimodal integration ([78]) point toward next-generation CTG systems that address these gaps while enabling new capabilities like real-time adaptation ([199]).\n\n### Conclusion  \nTransformer-based PLMs have redefined CTG by delivering precise control, human-like fluency, and remarkable domain adaptability—from legal document processing [19] to clinical note summarization [11]. While challenges in factual reliability and ethical deployment persist, ongoing innovations in retrieval-augmented generation and evaluation frameworks lay the groundwork for the field's future trajectory, as discussed in the following section on emerging frontiers. This evolution underscores the need for collaborative efforts to harness PLMs' potential while mitigating risks—a theme that unifies the past, present, and future of CTG research.  \n---\n\n### 7.3 Future Trajectory and Call to Action\n\nThe field of controllable text generation (CTG) using transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) stands at a pivotal juncture, with immense potential to revolutionize how humans interact with machines and how information is processed across domains. Building on the transformative impact of PLMs discussed in the previous section—which highlighted breakthroughs in fine-grained control, fluency, and adaptability—this subsection explores emerging frontiers, persistent challenges, and future directions for CTG. While architectures like GPT, BERT, and T5 [1] have enabled unprecedented capabilities, the path forward requires addressing critical gaps in multimodal integration, factual reliability, scalability, and ethical deployment to realize CTG's full potential.\n\n### Expanding Horizons: Multimodal and Multilingual CTG  \nThe next evolution of CTG lies in transcending monolingual text to embrace multimodal and multilingual contexts. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MM-LLMs) [132] demonstrate how integrating visual, auditory, and textual data can enrich generative tasks like image captioning and video summarization. Similarly, multilingual models such as mT5 [26] and RoBERTuito [91] underscore the feasibility of cross-lingual CTG, which is essential for global accessibility. However, significant disparities remain in handling low-resource languages and dialects [167]. Addressing these gaps will require collaborative efforts to curate diverse datasets and develop efficient adaptation techniques, ensuring CTG benefits all linguistic communities.\n\n### Confronting Hallucination and Bias  \nDespite their remarkable capabilities, PLMs still grapple with generating factually inconsistent or biased content. Hallucination remains a critical challenge, particularly in high-stakes domains like healthcare and law [166; 165]. While techniques such as Chain-of-Verification (CoVe) and adversarial training [30] show promise, a more systemic approach is needed. This includes refining evaluation benchmarks, integrating real-time fact-checking modules, and addressing biases embedded in training data, as evidenced by studies on demographic and cultural skews in models like GPT and BERT [30]. Open-source tools for bias detection, coupled with robust ethical guidelines and auditing frameworks, will be essential to mitigate these risks.\n\n### Toward Efficient and Scalable Solutions  \nThe computational demands of large PLMs pose significant barriers to widespread adoption, especially for resource-constrained settings. Innovations in model compression, such as Tensor Train Matrix representations [89] and quantization techniques [151], offer promising avenues for reducing memory and energy costs. Architectures like ParallelGPT and ConvCompressedGPT [90] further demonstrate that smaller models can retain competitive performance. Future research should prioritize democratizing access to CTG technologies through lightweight frameworks and efficient training paradigms, such as the multi-node BERT pretraining approach [200]. Collaboration with hardware developers to optimize inference pipelines, as exemplified by DFX [28], will be critical to enhancing scalability.\n\n### Navigating Ethical and Societal Implications  \nThe societal impact of CTG demands careful consideration. While models like ChatGPT [128] and ProcessGPT [93] offer transformative benefits, they also raise concerns about misuse, such as deepfakes or automated misinformation [130]. A proactive approach is needed, combining technical safeguards with policy frameworks to ensure accountability. Initiatives like the FAIR Data Pipeline provide a blueprint for ethical data usage, but interdisciplinary collaboration is essential to address broader questions of intellectual property, labor displacement, and digital equity.\n\n### A Call to Action for the CTG Community  \nTo fully realize CTG's potential, the following actions are imperative:  \n\n1. **Foster Open Collaboration**: Accelerate the development of open-source alternatives to proprietary models [182] to ensure transparency and inclusivity. Expand shared resources, such as the HuggingFace model hub [91], to encompass more languages and domains.  \n\n2. **Prioritize Evaluation Rigor**: Current metrics like BLEU and ROUGE often fail to capture nuanced aspects of controllability and fairness. Community-wide efforts are needed to adopt and refine more comprehensive evaluation frameworks.  \n\n3. **Invest in Education and Outreach**: As CTG technologies permeate industries, training programs for developers and end-users are essential to mitigate misuse. Workshops like those on neural LMs [120] can bridge knowledge gaps, while public awareness campaigns can promote responsible usage.  \n\n4. **Advocate for Policy Frameworks**: Policymakers must collaborate with researchers to establish guidelines for CTG deployment, particularly in sensitive sectors like healthcare and legal systems [166; 165].  \n\nIn conclusion, the future of CTG is bright but hinges on collective action. By addressing technical challenges, ethical dilemmas, and accessibility barriers, the community can unlock CTG's potential to empower creativity, enhance productivity, and foster global communication. As the following section will explore, the transformative power of these technologies must be guided by a commitment to equity, transparency, and human-centric design—principles that will ensure CTG serves as a force for good in the decades to come.\n\n\n## References\n\n[1] A Survey of Controllable Text Generation using Transformer-based  Pre-trained Language Models\n\n[2] Tailor  A Prompt-Based
